the   best   available   when   our   old   sharp   34   over   the   range   34   started   to   die   14   years   of   service   and   the   display   had   become   very   dim   and   door   starting   to   crack   with   quite   large   chips   falling   off   we   decided   it   had   to   be   replaced   .   finding   an   over   range   gas   with   convection   and   a   good   extractor   fan   proved   difficult   and   so   we   decided   on   this   sharp   product .   at   71   lbs   and   with   different   mounting   points   from   it   s   predecessor   it   was   a   difficult   installation   task   could   not   have   been   done   by   one   person   on   their   own .   br   once   in   place   however   it   is   the   greatest   !   it   is   better   designed   than   the   one   before   with   2   extractor   inlets   placed   to   handle   the   heat   from   the   gas   range   very   well   ,   a   large   ceramic   turntable   that   is   easy   to   clean   plus   it   can   be   selected   to   34   not   rotate   34   which   permits   bigger   dishes   to   be   used   as   needed .   br   br   best   of   all   it   has   a   34   keep   warm   34   feature   that   allows   warming   serving   plates   as   well   as   keeping   unserved   food   ready   for   34   seconds   34   without   the   whole   reheat   cycle .   br   br   great   product   would   have   given   5   stars   but   for   the   physical   difficulty   of   installation   in   fairness   that   would   have   probably   been   much   the   same   for   any   brand  
bad   product   microwave   does   it   s   job   but   door   started   sagging   within   first   30   days   and   the   unit   quit   working   within   a   year .
new   microwave   we   love   this   new   appliance .   just   a   few   days   before   thanksgiving   our   old   one   died .   i   purchased   a   new   one   locally   and   after   installation   realized   the   door   hinges   are   placed   where   we   could   not   open   the   door   more   than   a   few   inches .   returned   that   one   and   went   online   and   found   this   one   at   almost   100.00   less   than   what   my   local   dealer   could   get   it   for   me .   he   agreed   that   i   should   order   thru   amazon   and   not   only   did   i   receive   it   in   less   than   a   week ,   it   fit ,   looks   great   and   works   perfectly !
perfect   size   for   table   top   microwave   simple   to   use ,   spacious ,   and   compact .   been   looking   for   a   microwave   like   this   for   a   while .   the   only   drawback   is   it   looks   a   bit   like   a   old   tv   on   the   kitchen   counter .
horrible   product   this   is   the   second   microwave   and   just   like   the   first   one   it   lasted   less   then   a   year .   the   magnetron   fried ,   we   bought   a   new   one ,   it   fried   again ,   we   fixed   it   and   it   happened   a   3rd   time .   i   will   not   buy   another   whirlpool   product !
did   the   job   the   microwave   in   our   new   house   had   corrosion   and   under   the   turntable .   i   sanded   and   cleaned   for   about   an   hour   then   sprayed   this   paint .   i   did   have   a   little   overspray   but   it   turned   out   pretty   well .   there   s   a   spot   that   looks   like   i   didn   t   sand   and   clean   well   enough   but   there   is   plenty   of   paint   left   in   the   can   to   re   do   it .   it   s   good   enough   for   now   and   the   paint   is   holding   up   well   after   a   month .
difficult   to   open   the   push   latch   for   the   door   is   very   tricky .   sometimes   it   opens   the   door   at   once .   mostly   it   takes   repeated   efforts .
no   choice   in   purchasing ,   adequate   product   this   is   the   only   microwave   made   that   fits   into   my   pre   constructed   custom   cabinet   space .   my   first   one   lasted   8   years .   when   it   wouldn   t   turn   off ,   i   ordered   a   new   one .   the   first   one   sent   to   me   would   not   turn   on .   seems   like   something   was   wrong   with   the   key   pad .   ge   s   fault , not   the   distributor   or   amazon .   called   amazon   and   they   credited   me   immediately   and   charged   sent   me   a   new   one   the   next   day   which   worked   perfectly .   i   just   returned   the   first   one   in   the   original   box   with   the   scanner   label   they   sent .
fine   for   awhile   we   bought   this   mwo   20   months   ago   and   were   satisfied   until   the   magnetron   failed   at   20   months ,   which   is   unacceptable !   since   the   magnetron   has   a   10   yr   warranty ,   we   checked   for   local   authorized   repairmen ,   but   there   were   none   close   enough   to   make   the   repair   worthwhile ,   since   we   have   to   pay   for   labor .   check   this   out   before   you   buy .
tiny   treasure   i   live   in   a   small   house   400   sf   so   i   don   t   have   much   room   for   anything .   this   may   be   too   soon   for   a   review   as   i   just   received   the   microwave   y   day   but   so   far   it   s   just   perfect .   i   love   that   the   controls   are   on   the   bottom   instead   of   on   the   side ,   as   my   microwave   cubby   is   only   16.5   inches   wide .   i   like   the   style   and   the   easy   setup ,   as   well .   it   s   perfect   for   an   apartment ,   dorm   room ,   or   office   kitchen .   br   br   one   thing   to   note   on   the   inside   left   wall   if   you   re   facing   the   microwave   ,   there   s   what   looks   like   a   cardboard   panel   screwed   into   the   wall   by   the   vent .   there   isn   t   anything   definitive   about   what   to   do   about   this   panel ,   and   since   it   looks   like   it   could   possibly   be   removed ,   i   called   whirlpool   customer   service   to   get   some   clarification .   long   story   short   don   t   remove   the   panel ,   it   s   supposed   to   be   there .   br   br   other   than   that   momentary   confusion ,   i   m   really   happy   with   this   product .
don   t   buy   doesn   t   last   we   read   all   the   negative   reviews   but   decided   to   take   a   chance   anyway   as   this   was   the   only   size   microwave   that   fit   the   cabinet   space   we   had .   big   mistake .   1yr   2months   after   we   bought   it   the   magnetrom   stopped   working   the   microwave   no   longer   heats   anything .   called   for   service   and   since   labor   is   out   of   warranty   it   would   cost   us   180   to   get   it   fixed .   even   before   that   some   of   the   exterior   plastic   pieces   had   actually   come   off   and   we   had   just   taped   it   back   on .   br   well ,   we   re   not   buying   another   one   of   these   nor   getting   it   fixed .   we   ve   chosen   to   re   do   the   cabinet   because   in   the   long   run   it   will   be   cheaper   than   to   keep   buying   a   poorly   built   product   that   lasts   just   past   its   1   yr   warranty .   will   be   staying   away   from   ge   products   as   well .
this   microwave   is   terrible .   this   microwave   is   garbage .   we   have   had   many   problems   with   it ,   fought   with   the   warrenty   center ,   they   finally   replaced   it   and   it   is   not   working   again .   microwave   ovens   should   last   longer   than   just   a   couple   years .   whirlpool   you   need   to   do   something   about   this .   you   know   this   isnt   just   a   random   problem .   you   have   produced   a   inferior   product   and   you   need   to   do   something   about   it .   this   microwave   costs   1000.00 .   this   isnt   a   walmart   throw   away   item .   you   need   to   recall   this   item !
worst   appliance   ever   made !   there   is   definitely   a   manufacturing   flaw   with   this   microwave   that   whirlpool   refuses   to   admit !   when   this   microwave   was   under   warranty   in   the   first   year ,   we   had   if   fixed   four   times   for   the   same   problem .   luckily   we   didn   t   have   to   pay   for   those   repairs   because   the   warranty   covered   it .   while   it   was   still   under   warranty ,   we   tried   to   talk   to   the   company   and   let   them   know   about   the   four   repairs   for   the   same   thing   noting   that   it   must   be   a   problem   with   how   the   product   was   made .   all   they   did   was   try   to   get   us   to   buy   the   extended   warranty .   br   br   so ,   8   months   after   we   bought   this   500   microwave ,   we   had   to   buy   a   new   one !   i   truly   believe   that   whirlpool   knows   there   is   a   defect   with   this   microwave   but   refuses   to   stand   behind   their   product .
great   item   item   was   what   was   advertised ,   in   condition   advertised   and   delivered   on   time .   that   s   all   you   can   ask   of   a   supplier .   you   must   prepare   the   area   where   you   are   going   to   use   the   paint .   takes   a   lot   of   sanding   and   preparing ,   but   the   result   of   spraying   even   coats   is   great .
very   nice   design   i   bought   this   microwave   almost   a   year   ago .   love   it .   quality   is   good   enough   i   do   not   use   it   too   often   .   i   really   in   love   with   the   design .
nice !   this   is   a   really   nice   little   microwave !   just   what   i   was   looking   for .   no   complaints .   it   was   shipped   quickly   by   the   supplier ,   too .   the   controls   are   simple   and   elegant ,   and   the   surfaces   are   easy   to   clean .   i   would   buy   it   again .
fast   shipment !   so   far   so   good .   replaced   a   samsung   and   the   existing   bracket   worked .   much   quieter   than   the   one   replaced .   my   wife   loves   the   br   melt   soften   function .
3   month   life ,   warranty   worthless   i   bought   this   microwave   august   2012 .   it   died   november .   the   operator   s   manual   stated   that ,   to   avoid   trip   charges ,   i   should   take   it   ge   customer   care   services   and   pick   it   up   following   service .   called   up   1   800   gecares ,   as   given   in   the   manual ,   to   inquire   on   where   to   take   it   for   service .   there   was   no   option   to   do   that .   they   want   to   make   a   service   call   and   charge   80   trip   fee .   br   br   stay   away   from   ge   products .   they   re   defective   and   service   is   poor .
broken   keypad   after   1   year   i   have   to   echo   previous   reviews .   we   got   this   microwave   because   it   fit   in   with   our   stainless   steel   appliances   after   we   redid   our   kitchen .   it   s   actually   a   great   microwave ,   i   think ,   it   looks   great   and   the   settings   features   are   really   nice .   but ,   a   little   bit   after   the   1   year   warranty   ran   out ,   part   of   the   keypad   became   defective   the   numbers .   some   of   the   other   buttons   worked   so   we   could   still   partly   use   it   while   we   diddled   around   before   finally   calling   the   repair   technician .   he   came   out ,   took   one   look   at   it   and   told   us   that   it   would   be   more   expensive   to   repair   it   than   to   just   buy   a   new   one .   called   and   complained   to   ge ,   and   we   were   able   to   score   a   ge   credit   worth   almost   the   price   of   another   microwave .   we   had   specific   space   look   criteria ,   so   we   had   to   end   up   buying   the   same   one .   it   s   only   a   matter   of   time   before   it   goes ,   too .   br   br   to   add   another   note ,   my   college   apartment   has   the   exact   same   microwave ,   only   in   white   instead   of   stainless   steel .   the   keypad   also   broke   one   day ,   and   when   i   called   to   get   it   fixed   they   came   out   the   next   day   and   replaced   the   whole   thing   apparently   it   happens   so   often   they   have   a   few   of   them   just   sitting   around   as   replacements .   br   br   i   m   giving   it   2   stars   because ,   while   it   is   prone   to   breaking ,   it   is   at   least   a   really   functional   attractive   microwave   and   we   didn   t   have   to   pay   very   much   on   a   replacement .   if   you   only   need   a   microwave   for   1   year   or   less ,   it   s   a   good   buy .   any   longer ,   which   will   be   most   people ,   find   a   different   brand .
good   microwave   i   have   only   had   this   installed   for   several   days   and   have   not   used   all   functions ,   but   so   far   it   seems   like   a   good   machine .
well ,   it   s   smallish ...   and   when   that   is   the   most   positive   thing   you   can   say   about   an   appliance   you   know   there   isn   t   much   left   to   work   with .   the   power   is   lacking   and   the   controls   are   confusing .   it   s   the   year   2012 ,   there   is   no   reason   to   need   to   keep   the   instruction   manual   for   a   microwave   oven   handy   so   guests   can   use   it .   i   gave   it   two   stars   because   it   does   free   up   extra   counter   space .
add   mine   to   the   junk   list   i   ve   been   trying   to   get   through   to   whirlpool   about   this   microwave ,   having   the   same   issues   as   everyone   else .   i   don   t   ever   remembering   seeing   a   product   with   all   1   star   reviews   i   don   t   know   if   it   s   even   worth   getting   this   fixed   through   warranty   after   reading   all   these .   i   won   t   be   buying   any   whirlpool   from   here   on   including   any   other   brand   names   they   use .
i   ordered   these   motors   to   power   a   miniature   barber   pole   project   they   work   great .   motors   turn   at   the   correct   speed   and   are   powerful   enough   to   power   my   project   of   a   miniature   barber   pole   and   the   price   was   good .
great   for   a   couple   years   loved   this   microwave   when   it   worked ...   br   i   never   had   a   problem   with   its   cooking   functions ,   lived   swore   by   the   sensor   reheat ,   and   did   what   it   was   supposed   to .   the   problem   i   encountered   was   that   after   owning   it   for   about   a   year   and   a   half ,   it   suddenly   stopped   working .   i   d   set   the   time   and   hit   start ,   the   light   inside   would   come   on ,   the   clock   would   count   down ,   but   neither   the   turntable   would   turn   nor   would   the   microwave   actually   start   cooking .   br   i   drove   it   to   a   sharp   certified   technician ,   and   about   65   later ,   it   worked   fine .   at   least ,   for   another   year   or   so .   repeated   the   process ,   paid   another   65 ,   and   then   it   worked   fine .   this   time ,   for   another   year .   thanks   to   the   economy ,   my   sharp   certified   technician   lost   his   business ,   and   now   i   had   to   drive   it   over   an   hour   away   if   i   wanted   it   fixed .   br   i   brought   it   to   a   sears   service   center ,   where   they   fixed   it   for   about   50 ,   and   they   said   there   was   a   problem   with   some   kind   of   safety   latch   with   the   door .   this   time ,   it   lasted   about   6   months .   i   agree   with   other   users ,   that   every   microwave   on   the   market   has   some   kind   of   issue .   it   s   time   to   accept   the   fact   that   we   want   these   machines   to   do   more   than   they   could   15   years   ago ,   and   either   the   craftsmanship   isn   t   there ,   or   our   appliances   simply   can   t   handle   the   demands   anymore .   i   guess   5   years   is   a   decent   lifetime   now ,   sadly .
do   not   buy !   needs   a   recall ,   but   whirlpool   does   not   care .   this   microwave   was   selected   during   a   kb   home   build   for   our   new   home   over   2   years   ago   summer   2010   .   the   microwave   indicated   that   it   was   manufactured   in   april   2010 .   low   and   behold   the   microwave   would   start   shutting   down   by   itself   when   i   hit   start   beginning   about   june   2012 .   a   few   days   ago   it   just   stopped   working   completely .   no   pop ,   no   fizzle ,   no   crackle   it   just   wouldn   t   heat   up   anything .   whirlpool   dispatched   a   3rd   party   repair   person   and   he   stated   that   the   magnetron   was   bad   or   dead   .   he   was   fairly   certain   it   was   a   recall   item .   the   repair   person   estimated   that ,   absent   a   recall ,   it   would   cost   450   to   fix .   the   service   appointment   itself   was   89 .   the   following   day ,   the   repair   service   left   a   voice   mail   stating   that   it   was   not   a   recall   item ,   but   that   i   should   verify   it   with   whirlpool   .   br   br   i   contacted   whirlpool   1   800   253   1301   and   the   customer   service   rep   stated   that   it   wasn   t   their   problem   once   the   standard   12   month   warranty   had   elapsed .   the   rep   said   there   was   no   recall   for   the   magnetron .   i   escalated   the   matter   to   a   supervisor .   all   the   supervisor   did   was   reiterate   that   whirlpool   wasn   t   going   to   do   anything   past   the   12   months .   the   supervisor   then   offered   to   sell   me   one   of   four   new   microwaves   at   a   vip   rate .   of   course   the   rate   was   not   vip   at   all   once   you   added   the   deliver   70   and   the   installation   45   charges   so   for   being   screwed   over ,   i   was   a   vip   .   it   goes   without   saying   that   i   didn   t   take   her   up   on   the   offer   s   .   br   br   needless   to   say ,   i   was   very   upset   and   immediately   google   d   the   model   number   in   the   hope   of   finding   out   more   info   on   the   problem   and   perhaps   locating   a   cheaper   replacement   for   the   microwave .   and   that ,   my   friends ,   is   how   i   ended   up   here   on   amazon   and   saw   that   29   other   reviewers   before   me   also   had   issues   with   this   particular   microwave .   i   got   a   certified   lemon .   br   br   what   are   my   options   at   this   point   a   class   action   lawsuit   a   complaint   to   the   state   attorney   general   s   office   i   don   t   know .   what   i   do   know   is   that   whirlpool   is   aware   of   the   problem   and   could   not   care   less .   i   m   out   of   600   or   more   and   i   m   left   reheating   stuff   in   the   oven   now .   br   br   do   not   buy   this   microwave .
mr .   johnny   warren   this   product   sucks   ass   when   i   received   it   doesn   t   work   and   have   tryed   and   tryed   to   exchange   it   but   whirlpool   does   not   and   will   not   stand   behind   there   products
affordable   quality   this   is   the   second   sharp   r   1405 ,   over   the   range   microwave   i   have   owned .   the   first   one   lasted   8   years   and   gave   me   excellent   service .   so   i   was   thrilled   when   i   found   the   same   model   still   being   produced .   i   snatched   it   up   and   easily   installed   it   because   the   same   install   hardware   was   required   and   90   of   the   mounting   hardware   was   already   installed   in   the   wall   above   the   stove .   not   only   that .. the   price   was   about   200   or   300   less   than   comparable   over   the   range   microwaves .   an   excellent   product   that   gets   the   job   done ! ! ... i   highly   recommend   it !
last   samsung   product   ever   same   story   as   the   others   here .   poor   product ,   poor   service .   the   dreaded   se   code   after   20   months .   debating   smashing   it   on   youtube   once   i   get   a   new   microwave .   don   t   buy   this   rubbish !
ge   profile   4   stars   for   now   looks   only !   we   purchased   ours   from   a   local   store   in   on   order   to   have   it   installed .   they   don   t   install   the   charcoal   filter !   grrrr ....   the   reason   i   was   so   disappointed   is   because   i   d   read   it   was   a   bugger   to   install ,   as   it   was   the   wrong   size .   i   was   appalled   to   be   told   that   they   never   install   the   filters ,   even   if   purchased   from   that   store   bought   mine   on   amazon   for   30   cheaper   than   the   chain !   .   was   told   i   have   to   take   the   front   panel   off ! !   if   the   directions   are   followed   carefully ,   it   s   very   simple .   it   is   designed   to   tilt ,   not   stand   straight   inside   the   vent   opening ,   as   one   would   think .   i   tell   you   all   this   to   say ,   laugh   at   the   installation   guys ,   get   a   screwdriver ,   and   tilt   the   filter   in ,   and   pat   yourself   on   the   back .   who   needs   them   anyway   oh ,   yeah ... to   lift   and   drill   and   screw   the   thing   in .   it   s   heavy !   now ,   as   for   performance ,   more   to   come   later !   br   br   one   last   thing ,   all   the   reading   i   did   on   this   led   me   to   believe   the   vent   was   a   powered   door   that   opened ,   and   that   is   a   part   that   often   breaks   on   otr   microwaves .   this   does   not   have   a   powered   vent   door ,   it   just   recirculates .   that   was   the   only   reason   i   purchased   a   warranty .   oh   well ,   now   you   know !
be   sure   to   save   the   box !   we   loved   the   small   size   appearance .   unfortunately ,   it   worked   for   the   first   3   days ,   so   we   through   away   the   box .   before   the   week   was   over ,   it   wouldn   t   heat   anything   no   matter   how   long   we   set   the   timer   for ,   or   what   power   setting   we   used .   without   the   box ,   it   can   t   be   returned .   a   complete   waste   of   money .   do   not   buy   this   microwave ,   or   if   you   feel   like   gambling ,   at   least   save   the   box !
sharp   microwave   turntable   for   some   strange   reason ,   my   microwave   turntable   plate   just   cracked   in   half .   i   didn   t   have   a   part   number   so   went   by   brand   and   size   and   found   the   perfect   replacement   through   an   amazon   vendor .   the   order   was   shipped   quickly   and   our   microwave   is   usable   again .   we   are   very   happy   and   would   recommend   the   vendor   and   product .
same   experience   as   everyone   else   awful   wish   i   had   checked   amazon   before   buying .   as   of   today ,   not   one   review   higher   than   2   stars .   i   have   to   agree .   ours   just   crapped   out   shortly   after   the   one   year   warranty .   anyway , with   most   warranties ,   it   s   simpler   to   just   buy   a   replacement   rather   than   go   through   the   hassle   and   expense   of   repair .   it   wouldn   t   be   so   bad   if   this   was   a   countertop   model ,   but   when   you   have   to   install   something ,   you   don   t   want   to   drag   it   out   and   leave   a   gaping   hole   in   your   kitchen .   i   will   avoid   any   frigidaire   appliance   from   now   on .
perfect ! ! !   when   the   turntable   on   my   sharp   microwave   stopped   turning ,   i   went   on   line   to   find   a   substitute .   some   years   ago   i   had   a   turntable   that   worked   independently   of   the   microwave .   simple   device .   works   by   winding   it   up ,   much   like   an   old   fashioned   alarm   clock .   br   br   after   googling   turntable ,   i   came   upon   this   little   motor   and   thought   34   why   not   34   ,   i   can   do   this .   i   know   nothing   about   electronics ,   so   i   realized   that   by   taking   the   microwave   apart   to   make   the   fix ,   i   might   destroy   it ,   but   it   wasn   t   working   anyway   so   i   decided   to   gamble   and   order   the   part .   br   br   i   very   carefully   opened   up   the   microwave   after   disconnecting   it   from   the   power   and   located   the   motor   that   turned   the   turntable .   it   was   simple   fairly   intuitive   to   remove   and   replace ,   and   for   a   very   small   amount   of   money ,   i   fixed   the   microwave .   i   ve   had   this   microwave   for   seven   plus   years   and   now   i   expect   to   get   another   seven ,   very   possibly   more .   br   br   overall ...   one   of   my   best   buys   on   amazon .
different   photo   in   ad   haven   t   returned   item   because   seem   to   be   complicated   return   policy   and   not   given   clear   answer   on   step .   the   actually   ad   is   different   than   the   actual   product .
died   after   16   months   like   most   other   reviews   here ,   i   can   confirm   that   this   microwave   died   quickly .   after   2   weeks   the   handle   broke   off   in   my   wifes   hand .   after   10   months   we   had   a   loose   connection   internally   that   needed   to   be   repaired ,   and   now   after   16   months ,   the   unit   is   completely   dead .   fuses   all   check   out   fine .   thermal   fuse ,   thermocouple   and   power   check   out   fine .   all   120   volts .   either   the   control   board   for   the   keypad   is   dead ,   or   the   magnatron ,   hv   capacitor   or   diode   is   shot .   either   way ,   we   are   not   repairing   the   unit   again .   it   will   be   replaced   with   a   commercial   microwave   and   i   will   build   a   shelf   for   it   to   sit   on   over   the   top   of   our   range .   i   will   mount   an   exhaust   fan   below   that   and   duct   it   all   outside .   br   br   this   microwave   has   completely   turned   me   off   from   the   samsung   brand   which   all   of   our   appliances   are   .   too   bad   it   s   just   cheap   construction   that   ruins   these   new   microwaves .   they   are   all   built   with   cheap   components ,   unless   you   buy   a   commercial   industrial   unit .   br   br   look   at   the   panasonic   pro   series   ne   1054 ,   vollrath   40830 ,   turbo   air   tmw   1100m ,   or   amana   rms   10d   for   quality   at   a   decent   price .   i   wish   they   made   a   commercial   over   the   range   style ,   but   i   have   yet   to   find   one .

great   value ,   excellent   performance .   a   bit   difficult   to   install .   our   over   the   range   microwave   died   suddenly   in   our   new   home .   i   was   not   the   original   purchase   of   this   particular   appliance ,   and   it   was   over   10   years   old .   br   br   so   i   began   looking   for   product   replacement .   i   found   a   whirlpool   model   online   that   had   some   nice   ratings ,   but   when   i   went   to   my   local   big   box   store   to   purchase ,   they   didn   t   have   the   exact   whirlpool   model   i   had   read   about .   what   i   found ,   was   this   model ,   which   i   assume   is   the   newest   version .   br   br   the   microwave   has   a   very   nice   finish .   the   door   and   front   feel   fairly   sturdy .   br   br   operation   is   simple .   i   tend   to   hate   overly   complex   controls .   i   want   power   and   simple   controls .   this   microwave   meets   my   needs   in   this   regard .   this   microwave   has   lots   of   power .   br   br   now   the   bad .   the   install .   this   is   my   second   microwave   install .   my   first   being   a   retrofit   of   an   over   the   range   fan .   br   br   my   first   install ,   and   noticing   the   hardware   of   my   current   broken   microwave .   the   units   are   mounted   by   a   rear   wall   bracket   that   holds   the   bottom   part   of   the   microwave .   and   the   top   of   the   microwave   is   held   by   a   couple   of   suspension   bolts   fixed   to   the   cabinet .   the   usual   location   of   these   bolts   are   the   two   front   corners   of   the   microwave .   br   br   the   rear   bracket   is   usually   the   same   size   shape   as   the   rear   of   the   microwave .   this   makes   it   fairly   easy   to   just   place   the   bracket   on   the   rear   wall   and   push   up   until   the   bracket   touches   the   cabinet .   no   measurement   really   necessary .   this   microwave   has   a   small   bar   hanger .   so   you   ll   need   to   be   very   accurate   with   a   measuring   tape   to   figure   out   where   the   bottom   of   the   microwave   will   sit   against   the   wall .   br   br   i   tend   to   not   trust   myself   in   this   regard .   so   i   taped   the   bracket   to   the   bottom   of   the   microwave .   held   the   microwave   up   against   the   wall ,   and   had   a   helper   draw   a   marking   line   with   a   pencil .   br   br   the   second   negative .   usually   the   suspension   bolts   are   at   the   front   corners   of   the   microwave .   in   mounting   position ,   my   current   defective   microwave   has   boltsin   the   corners .   i   could   have   taken   the   other   microwave   from   my   other   house   and   i   suspect   the   holes   are   in   the   same   position .   br   br   on   this   microwave ,   one   bolt   is   about   3   inches   in   from   the   edge   which   is   slightly   offset   .   the   second   bolt   is   about   7   inches   in   so   it   is   offset   quite   a   bit .   both   holes   did   not   line   up   with   my   current   microwave   mounting   holes .   so   to   mount   this   microwave   i   had   to   drill   new   holes   in   my   cabinet .   br   br   so   take   this   into   consideration .   i   bought   my   unit   as   a   floor   model   return .   i   suspect   it   was   returned   for   this   very   reason .   br   br   otherwise   i   ve   been   happy   with   this   purchase   so   far .
met   my   expectations   used   this   microwave   as   a   built   in .   i   had   a   specific   width   opening   in   some   shelving   and   wanted   the   most   cu   ft   and   features   in   this   width .   only   been   using   it   for   a   couple   weeks   however   it   has   met   my   expectations .   the   body   of   this   unit   is   black   so   if   you   are   looking   for   an   all   stainless   for   countertop   use   this   would   not   be   the   one .
door   latch   broke   after   18   month   had   this   microwave   for   only   18   month   and   the   door   latching   spring   broke .   now   i   can   t   close   the   door ,   and   nothing   works .
this   microwave   sucks ! ! ! ! !   this   microwave   sucks   and   so   does   the   seller ! ! ! !   i   purchased   this   microwave   in   april   because   i   was   remodeling   my   kitchen   and   was   upgrading   to   this   better   quality   stainless   steel   over   the   range   microwave .   well   how   i   said   i   purchased   it   in   april ,   but   didn   t   install   it   until   the   beginning   of   august .   the   delivery   was   fast ,   but   when   i   reccieved   it ,   two   of   the   back   corners   were   dented ,   but   i   decided   to   install   it   anyways   because   it   was   in   the   back   anyways   and   nobody   would   ever   see   it .   it   is   now   october   and   it   has   gone   out   on   me .   i   was   about   to   warm   up   my   dinner   when   i   pressed   start   and   boom   it   went   out .   it   turned   off   just   like   that .   it   never   turned   back   on .   i   am   really   dissapointed   becasue   i   thought   i   had   purchased   a   good   quality   product .   i   contacted   the   seller   and   he   said   to   call   samsung   and   they   would   cover   it   since   its   still   under   warranty .   well   it   is   under   warranty ,   but   the   thing   is   it   turns   out   this   is   a   refurbished   unit   when   the   seller   says   he   purchased   it   new   from   lowes .   he   s   a   liar   becasue   lowes   does   not   sell   refurbished   units .   so   now   i   m   out   a   couple   hundred   and   now   i   have   to   purchase   a   new   one .   people   please   listen   to   the   reviews   and   don   t   buy   this   microwave ,   whether   it   s   her   or   some   other   place .   save   yourselves   time ,   money ,   and   dissapointment .   also ,   do   not   buy   from   this   seller   he   is   sooo   unproffesional   and   not   helpfull .   i   only   give   it   one   star   because   i   have   to   give   it   a   1   5   or   else   i   would   give   it   a   0 .
my   favorite   microwave   this   is   the   third   model   of   this   microwave   i   have   bought .   since   i   do   a   lot   of   cooking   with   my   microwave ,   i   enjoy   all   the   features   this   one   has   particularly ,   the   34   baked   potato   34   and   34   sensor   reheat   34   functions .   not   only   was   i   overjoyed   to   find   the   exact   model ,   i   saved   over   70   on   my   replacement !   i   was   also   pleasantly   surprised   when   it   arrived   three   days   after   my   order !
awful   this   was   the   consumer   reports   recommended   one ,   and   we   bought   one   based   on   that ,   only   to   have   it   fail   within   24   months .   i   won   t   be   wasting   money   on   repairing   this ,   and   certainly   won   t   be   buying   a   samsung   brand .
not   like   they   used   to   make   i   purchased   this   product   because   our   last   spacesaver   finally   bit   the   dust   after   almost   20   years .   not   the   same   quality   product   as   previously   produced .   door   sticks   ,   popcorn   button   doesn   t   always   spin   turntable   as   indicated   in   manual .
samsung   does   not   stand   behind   products .   do   not   buy !   evidently   this   is   a   common   problem   with   samsung   microwaves   the   keypad   shorted   out   after   less   than   two   years   of   use ,   resulting   in   the   microwave ,   stove   light ,   and   exhaust   fan   becoming   inoperable .   the   cost   of   repair   for   labor   only   would   have   been   150   for   an   item   that   originally   cost   220 .   after   several   calls   to   samsung   s   executive   customer   relations   department ,   i   was   curtly   informed   that   samsung   is   unwilling   to   take   any   action   to   remedy   this   situation .   my   only   option   at   this   point   is   to   replace   the   microwave   not   with   a   samsung   product   as   i   have   no   way   of   running   the   exhaust   fan   in   my   newly   remodeled   kitchen .   and   even   worse ,   due   to   some   new   environmental   law ,   i   will   have   to   pay   to   dispose   of   this   worthless   piece   of   junk .   br   br   samsung   does   not   stand   behind   the   products   they   sell .   samsung   has   atrocious   customer   service .   across   the   board   their   products   get   poor   reviews ,   yet   they   are   unwilling   to   take   any   action   to   correct   the   problem   and   maintain   good   customer   relations .   they   appear   to   operate   under   the   assumption   that   for   every   dissatisfied   customer ,   there   are   thousands   more   willing   to   buy   their   shoddy   crap .   this   attitude   is   unacceptable ,   especially   in   these   tough   economic   times .   br   br   i   will   never   buy   any   samsung   product ,   ever !   save   yourself   the   aggravation   do   not   buy !
good ,   but   with   some   surprises   this   microwave   fits   perfectly   with   our   ge   cafe   gas   range ,   which   is   why   we   bought   it .   it   s   quite   heavy   apparently   due   to   the   built   in   convection   oven .   disappointing   is   the   plastic   handle ,   which   look   like   stainless   steel ,   but   isn   t .   i   expect   more   from   an   800   appliance .   also ,   if   you   plan   to   vent   this   into   the   kitchen ,   make   sure   you   have   a   cabinet   over   the   microwave   that   is   not   more   than   13   inches   deep .   the   microwave   vents   are   on   top   of   the   front   of   the   microwave   and   blow   straight   up .   other   microwaves   have   vents   that   fold   open ,   which   is   a   really   cool   idea .   again ,   the   ge   cafe   falls   short   here .   hence ,   only   three   stars   for   now .   i   will   update   this   as   we   use   it   more .
750   watts   and   beautiful !   this   whirlpool   wmc2005yw   0.5   cubic   feet   countertop   microwave   oven   is   the   best   microwave   we   have   ever   had .   we   sold   our   house ,   where   we   had   a   built   in   micro ,   and   moved   into   a   condo   4   years   ago   and   bought   a   small   haier .   the   only   thing   good   about   the   haier   was ,   it   was   small ,   so   when   it   blew   out   we   had   to   go   small   again .   i   totally   counted   on   the   reviews   for   this   micro   and ,   thank   you   everybody ,   you   are   so   right !   i   got   the   white   one   because   my   counters   are   white   and   it   is   so   cute ,   just   nestled   into   that   small   space .   the   best   part   is   that   it   really   works   well .   we   feared   making   popcorn ,   which   the   haier   never ,   and   i   mean   never ,   did   well .   always   burnt   no   matter   what   we   tried .   this   whirlpool   made   perfect   popcorn   at   2   1   2   minutes .   we   snack   on   it   every   night   and   the   bag   fits   in   perfectly   with   room   to   spare .   it   will   fit   a   dinner   plate   easily   and   heats   evenly .   there   is   a   30   second   button ,   start ,   stop ,   and   a   clock   that   also   doubles   as   a   timer .   we   have   never   used   the   auto   buttons .   i   would   buy   this   again   in   a   minute .
fits   well   in   small   spaces   fits   well   on   countertop   in   small   space .   works   very   well   warming   and   re   heating .   works   better   that   other   microwave   that   was   much   bigger .

oven   i   am   very   satified   with   this   microwave   although   i   was   surprised   when   i   saw   two   small   dents   on   the   door .   this   of   course   does   not   in   anyway   hamper   the   workings .   i   would   recommend   this   product   for   its   efficiency .
worried   how   long   it   will   hold   up .   i   needed   a   small   microwave   for   my   small   kitchen   and   this   one   fits   the   bill .   why   aren   t   there   more   small   appliances   out   there   oh   right ,   we   live   in   the   u . s . ,   where   bigger   is   supposedly   better   .   br   br   anyway ,   this   microwave   has   performed   fine   so   far   powerful   enough   for   reheating   leftovers   in   a   timely   manner   .   it   doesn   t   heat   very   evenly ,   but   in   my   experience ,   most   microwaves   don   t .   if   it   s   soup ,   no   problem ,   just   stir .   if   it   s   a   frozen   burrito ,   the   ends   will   be   bubbling   while   the   middle   is   still   frozen .   annoying .   br   br   however ,   the   biggest   complaint   after   having   this   microwave   for   just   one   month   is   that   there   is   a   thin   layer   of   plastic   over   the   control   buttons   and   it   is   already   scratched   and   peeling   off   in   some   places !   makes   me   concerned   about   the   overall   quality   of   this   thing .
lifetime   less   than   6   years   bought   ge   s   2006   model .   it   became   a   bread   box   clock   four   days   ago   about   9   15   2012   .   scheduled   one   of   their   authorized   repair   men .   took   him   5   minutes   to   determine   that   the   only   problem   was   that   the   microwave   generator   thingy   quit .   the   display ,   oven   light   and   turntable   are   as   good   as   new ,   but   the   micro   doesn   t   heat   anything .   cost   of   the   part   400 .   the   good   news   is   that   the   75   house   call   will   be   offset   by   getting   a   coupon   redeemable   for   100   if   i   buy   another   ge   profile   over   the   range .   my   cheap ,   little ,   off   brand   counter   top   microwave   just   won   t   quit   working .   i   m   not   certain   what   to   do .   br   br   one   last   thing ,   the   halogen   surface   light   quit   about   six   weeks   after   original   purchase .   you   have   to   stand   on   your   head ,   and   use   a   special   backhanded   screw   driver   to   replace   the   bulbs .   very   convenient   feature ,   but   maybe   i   should   have   paid   an   authorized   repair   tech   to   replace   the   bulbs .
perfect   for   a   small   space !   my   old   microwave   dating   back   to   the   mid   90s   finally   bit   the   dust .   i   was   worried   that   i   wouldn   t   find   another   compact   microwave   to   replace   it ,   but   this   one   fits   the   bill .   it   is   small ,   but   big   enough   for   the   needs   of   our   3   person   household .   i   find   height   to   be   more   limiting   that   width   in   microwaves ,   and   this   one   offers   about   the   same   height   as   a   regular   one .   it   s   not   as   powerful   as   some   of   the   full   sized   microwaves ,   but   an   extra   minute   of   waiting   is   worth   it   for   the   small   footprint .   it   s   attractive   although   the   buttons   are   not   terribly   intuitive .   the   rounded   back   works   well   for   our   needs ,   as   it   nestles   into   the   corner   even   better   than   our   previous   unit .   after   a   few   months   of   use ,   i   m   quite   pleased   with   this   purchase .
good   results   i   have   been   using   this   microwave   for   four   years   now   without   any   issues .   a   nice   deep   oven   with   a   really   powerful   fan .   good   results   every   time   i   use   it !
small   but   mightly   i   purchased   this   to   replace   a   much   larger   microwave   taking   a   lot   of   counter   space .   since   we   only   use   a   microwave   to   reheat   food   and   pop   popcorn ,   this   microwave   is   perfect .   i   held   off   using   it   for   several   weeks   because   the   inside   wall   of   the   microwave   had   a   rectangle   piece   of   cardboard   screwed   into   the   side   with   a   metal   and   some   plastic   screws .   i   removed   the   screws   and   cardboard   but   there   were   no   instructions   to   tell   me   to   remove   it .   once   removed ,   there   was   a   rectangle   hole   on   the   inside   wall   that   was   next   to   the   turntable   plate .   my   old   microwave   didn   t   have   an   open   space .   my   concern   was   that   if   i   heat   soup ,   it   could   run   over   the   bowl   and   spill   inside   this   open   space .   it   still   doesn   t   make   sense   to   me   because   the   cardboard   couldn   t   have   been   meant   to   be   left   in   since   it   can   t   be   wiped   down   when   cleaning   the   inside   of   the   microwave .   oh   well ,   this   mini   micro   works   great   and   heats   everything   we   need   to   the   correct   temp   using   the   approximate   times   i   used   on   my   old   microwave .   yes ,   i   d   purchase   this   again   but   i   ll   also   be   purchasing   a   rubber   mat   to   place   under   it   because   it   slides   around   when   opening   or   closing   the   door .
broke   after   less   than   2   years   keypad   error   se .   185   to   repair .   i   m   getting   a   new   microwave ,   but   can   t   seem   to   find   a   good   review   on   any   of   them   from   someone   who   had   it   more   than   1   year .
great   microwave   had   microwave   for   about   four   years   and   no   problems ,   it   was   the   only   one   you   could   br   see   to   operate   in   my   center   island   without   getting   down   on   the   foor .   br   as   for   cooking   it   seems   to   cook   better   than   my   old   one   with   a   turntable
great   while   it   worked ... but   same   problem   as   everyone   else   after   about   18   months   of   working   beautifully ,   we   also   got   that   se   error .   called   an   authorized   dealer   and   between   the   cost   of   a   service   call ,   the   price   of   labor   and   the   price   of   the   new   keypad ,   it   will   cost   200   to   fix .   no   way ! !   i   will   be   purchasing   a   new   microwave   and   it   will   most   definitely   not   be   a   samsung ! !   time   to   issue   a   recall   like   they   do   with   cars ... they   know   who   has   registered   this   product .   we   should   all   be   given   replacement   keyboards   free   of   charge .   we   need   lemon   laws   for   appliances .   i   urge   you   to   stay   away   from   this   one .   br   br   update   br   i   spoke   with   the   authorized   service   provider   and   he   suggested   i   contact   samsung   directly   1   800   726   7864   .   i   spoke   with   customer   service   and   then   was   transferred   to   executive   customer   relations .   they   first   offered   me   a   free   replacement   part   but   told   me   i   would   have   to   pay   for   the   service   call   and   any   labor   charges .   i   told   her   that   was   not   acceptable   as   that   would   still   cost   me   135 .   she   put   me   on   hold   again   and   came   back   telling   me   she   could   give   me   as   a   courtesy   a   one   time   only   warranty   extension .   she   made   it   clear   it   would   not   ever   be   repeated .   so ,   at   least   now   i   will   have   the   repair   done   at   no   cost   to   me .   hopefully   the   new   part   will   last   longer   than   the   original .   i   suggest   you   try   giving   them   a   call   if   you   are   one   of   the   many   with   this   problem .
looks   nice ,   heats   fine ,   but   you   can   t   cook   and   have   timer   at   same   time   it   s   a   decent   microwave ,   no   better   or   worse   than   others   i   ve   had   over   the   last   30   years   in   terms   of   cooking .   br   br   if   it   looks   nice   in   your   kitchen   and   matches   your   other   appliances ,   it   might   be   worth   considering .   br   br   however ,   please   know   that   this   is   the   first   time   i   ve   ever   had   a   microwave   that   wont   let   me   set   a   timer   while   cooking .   nor   will   it   let   you   cook   food   in   it   while   a   timer   is   running .
don   t   waste   your   money   it   doesn   t   last !   this   product   initially   worked   very   well .   within   a   few   months ,   we   found   that   the   microwave   would   come   on   all   by   itself .   it   totally   quite   working   in   about   1.5   years .   i   have   read   many   complaints   just   like   this   one .   it   should   have   been   recalled   by   the   manufacturer .   i   will   never   buy   this   brand   again .
great   buy   very   happy   with   this   purchase .   for   the   money ,   great   product .   br   br   i   was   a   little   concerned ,   because   some   had   mentioned   the   clunky   door ,   but   i   find   no   problems   with   it .

samsung   1.8   cu . ft .   otr   microwave   we   have   had   this   microwave   for   just   over   a   year .   one   month   after   warranty   we   got   an   se   error   code .   in   doing   some   research   we   found   over   200   complaints   about   it   on   the   samsung   web   site .   with   a   lot   of   complaining   we   got   them   to   authorize   a   free   service   call .
samsung   microwave   i   bought   this   microwave   18   months   ago   from   sears   and   it   looked   good   and   worked   just   fine   until   the   se   error   message   came   up   a   week   ago .   then   the   keypad   stopped   working .   we   tried   plugging   and   unplugging ,   and   i   have   tried   all   of   the   fixes   found   online   but   to   no   avail .   i   am   now   planning   to   replace   it   with   a   quality   product .   so   much   for   buying   a   good   looking   product   that   reviewers   say   works   well .   i   want   my   appliances   to   last   more   than   a   year   and   half .
works   great ,   looks   cool   i   have   a   super   small   kitchen   and   this   microwave   fits   perfectly   inside .   it   works   great   and   looks   pretty   cool .   i   was   hesitant   about   it   fitting   a   large   dinner   plate   but   it   does ! ! !   so ,   it   works   for   all   my   needs .   maybe   the   only   downside   is   that   you   can   basically   only   set   it   in   30   second   intervals   but   that   is   normally   the   type   of   microwave   cooking   i   do   anyway   so   it   s   fine   for   me .
thanks   sharp   thanks   amazon   we   bought   this   microwave   for   our   kitchen   remodel   partly   because   we   also   have   this   same   unit   in   our   motorhome .   br   the   combination   of   an   outside   hood   vent ,   range   light ,   convection   oven ,   and   microwave   made   it   a   bargain   as   well .   br   the   shipping   was   perfect .   it   was   packed   in   2   boxes ,   first   the   manufacture   s   styro   lined   box ,   then   that   box   was   bubble   wrapped   and   boxed   in   a   separate   larger   box .   br   the   stainless   steel   matches   our   other   appliances   and   looks   great !   br   thanks   sharp ,   thanks   amazon
peeling   paint   this   oven   made   it   about   a   year   before   the   interior   paint   started   peeling   off .   customer   service   was   not   helpful .   this   oven   cost   us   at   least   twice   what   comparable   ovens   cost .   we   bought   it   because   it   fit   the   space   we   had   available .   never   again .
stay   away   from   samsung   i   spent   several   thousand   dollars   on   samsung   appliances   as   part   of   a   kitchen   remodel   in   oct11 .   in   may   i   noticed   that   when   i   opened   the   door   of   the   microwave   it   appeared   to   have   a   short   a   bright   light   flashed   then   went   out   .   it   still   heated   but   as   i   thought   it   might   be   a   fire   hazard   i   contacted   samsung .   they   set   me   up   with   a   service   repair   company   that   had   a   poor   rating   on   angie   s   list .   a   guy   came   out ,   dismantled   it   and   said   a   key   part   needed   to   be   replaced   he   noted   switches   on   the   service   order   dated   may   15th   .   he   said   it   would   take   3   5   days   so   he   came   back   a   week   later ,   without   the   part ,   saying   he   just   need   to   tighten   some   wires .   it   worked   for   a   few   weeks ,   then   started   to   heat   only   intermittently .   called   the   service   company   again ,   and   a   guy   came   out   and   jiggled   the   door ,   saying   there   was   a   problem   with   the   switches ,   but   that   they   didn   t   need   to   be   replaced .   it   worked   again   for   a   few   weeks ,   where   i   had   to   keep   jiggling   the   door ,   and   finally   stopped   heating   altogether .   now ,   knowing   that   there   was   a   problem   with   the   switches ,   i   expected   the   guy   to   arrive   with   the   needed   part .   he   came   but   again ,   no   part ,   saying   he   just   wanted   to   confirm   it   was   the   switches   and   that   the   part   had   already   been   ordered .   after   not   hearing   anything   for   a   few   weeks ,   i   called   back   and   was   told   that   sharp   parts   were   backordered   .   when   i   told   her   it   was   a   samsung ,   she   didn   t   look   up   my   order   but   just   said   she   would   look   into   it   and   call   me   back .   after   not   hearing   anything   again ,   i   called   back   and   she   said   the   same   thing   sharp   is   back   ordered ,   correction   it   s   samsung   and   said   she   would   call   me   back .   again   didn   t   hear   back   so   called   samsung .   the   escalation   department   reviewed   the   situation   and   i   was   put   in   for   an   exchange   because   the   process   had   gone   on   so   long .   she   said   i   would   get   a   call   from   someone   who   would   review   options   with   me   when   i   asked   what   the   options   would   be   she   didn   t   know   why   is   that   .   instead ,   i   got   a   call   from   samsung   a   week   later   saying   that   the   servicecompany   had   miraculously   received   the   part   and   they   wanted   to   schedule   a   service   call .   i   told   her   i   had   been   put   in   for   an   exchange   and   she   insisted   that   i   again   deal   with   this   disreputable   service   company .   i   refused ,   and   since   i   didn   t   have   the   transaction   she   said   she   would   call   me   back   today .   she   didn   t   call   this   morning   when   she   said   she   would   so   i   called   samsung .   just   got   off   the   phone   with   samsung ,   who   refuses   to   replace   my   microwave .   it   just   seems   to   be   a   game   of   stringing   customers   along   with   vague   and   misleading   promises .   the   only   2   service   companies   they   have   for   this   area   have   f   ratings   on   angie   s   list .   br   i   had   a   similar   situation   occur   with   my   1   month   old   stove   back   in   december ,   which   broke   on   xmas   eve .   after   3   months   of   fighting   with   samsung   best   buy   finally   felt   sorry   for   me   and   gave   me   a   new   stove .   br   after   spending   thousands   of   dollars   on   samsung   appliances   i   expected   more   from   samsung .   br   i   would   stay   away   from   samsung   or   if   you   do   purchase   an   appliance   from   them ,   get   an   independent   warranty .   customer   service   is   a   problem   area   for   them .

average   microwave   it   is   a   very   compact   microwave   and   will   fit   well   in   a   tight   space .   the   power   is   quite   low   and   heat   things   very   slowly ,   sometimes   painfully   slow .   if   you   have   a   small   kitchen ,   this   will   work   ok ,   but   be   prepared   to   put   up   with   slow   heating   and   not   so   easy   to   use   controls .

another   unhappg   coustomer   with   the   5e   error   we   purchased   our   samsung   over   the   range   microwave   14   months   ago .   we   started   getting   the   5e   but   it   would   clear   up   overnight .   then   it   got   so   none   of   the   keyboard   would   not   work .   i   guess   we   ll   have   to   buy   a   new   microwave   but   it   definitely   won   t   be   a   samsung .
very   happy   so   far   i   have   only   been   using   the   product   about   one   month   but   am   very   pleased   so   far .   it   is   well   designed   and   solves   the   problem   i   had   of   bending   down   all   the   time   to   access   the   microwave .   easy   to   install ,   looks   good .   some   reviewers   have   reported   quality   problems   though   i   ve   had   none   so   far .   i   will   update   my   review   if   it   fails
great   little   microwave   i   ordered   this   microwave   to   replace   an   over   the   over   microwave   we   had   that   stopped   working .   we   wanted   something   small   since   we   realized   we   don   t   use   on   much   anymore   except   for   frozen   vegetables   and   reheating   coffee .   we   needed   a   small   microwave   that   would   fit   in   a   small   area .   this   was   the   only   corner   model   microwave   i   could   find   anywhere   online .   it   is   very   cute   and   looks   like   an   old   school   television   set .   the   controls   are   very   simple ,   there   is   no   number   pad ,   you   use   the   and   minus   signs   to   adjust   cook   time .   this   microwave   also   has   a   built   in   timer   which   was   also   very   nice .   at   only   750   watts ,   it   seems   to   cook   at   the   same   rate   as   out   old   1100   watt   microwave .   br   although   the   price   was   higher   that   a   comprable   sized   microwave ,   the   size   and   shape   make   it   worth   the   extra   money .
first   and   last !   this   is   my   first   lg   microwave   and   it   will   be   my   last !   glass   plate   is   not   as   heat   resistant   and   breaks   easily   while   cooking   food .   customer   service   was   even   less   helpful .   buyer   beware ! ! ! !
total   junk   if   this   is   like   the   pvm1870   if   this   ge   profile   microwave   is   built   like   its   cousin ,   the   pvm1870 ,   beware   of   the   worst   quality   control   and   internal   components   possible .   in   the   two   years   we   have   owned   a   pvm1870   profile ,   it   has   had   6   service   calls   and   about   every   electronic   part   but   the   magnetron   has   been   replaced ,   several   components   have   been   replaced   twice .   i   can   accept   and   understand   an   electronic   component   failing ,   but   not   that   many   with   some   replaced   twice   does   not   speak   well   of   either   quality   internal   components ,   quality   internal   engineering   or   quality   control .   the   only   reason   that   i   gave   it   one   star   is   that   a   zero   star   rating   is   not   possible .   br   br   addendum   br   the   motor   power   supply   burned   up   again   plus   another   service   call   for   the   vent   door   not   opening   any   longer .   now   we   are   up   to   8   service   calls   on   the   extended   warranty .   this   ge   product   is   an   absolute   piece   of   junk   and   the   last   ge   product   we   will   ever   own .   btw   the   service   personnel   are   excellent   and   know   their   jobs   it   is   strictly   the   lack   of   build   quality   and   quality   control   for   this   ge   product   that   has   caused   so   many   failures .   it   does   not   deserve   any   stars   in   the   rating .
poor   quality   and   service   this   was   a   reeplacement   purchase .   our   previous   unit   had   no   issues   and   was   locally   purchased .   the   door   was   accidentally   damaged   and   could   not   be   easily   repaired .   needed   exact   replacement   for   previously   purchased   trim   kit   although   product   reviews   concerning .   within   2   weeks   the   electronic   key   board   routinely   malfunctioned .   often   requires   multiple   attempts   to   start .   contacted   seller   who   defered   back   to   ge .   not   the   kind   of   service   i   expected   nor   previously   experienced   with   an   amazon   vendor .   my   recommendation   is   to   avoid   both   vendor   and   product   if   possible .
just   right !   i   love   this   little   microwave   oven .   i   just   reheat   food   and   cook   some   frozen   dinners ,   so   i   wanted   something   that   wasn   t   a   counter   space   hog ,   was   easy   to   open   and   easy   to   clean ,   and   didn   t   have   a   lot   of   fancy   options   that   i   never   use .   previous   reviewers   have   noted   that   the   beep   is   loud   when   adding   time ,   and   that   the   seconds   have   to   be   added   in   5   second   increments   so   there   s   a   lot   of   pushing   the   button   ,   so   i   guess   there   s   still   room   for   improvement ,   but   it   does   exactly   what   i   want   it   to .   what   i   particularly   like   is   the   solid   face   without   buttons   sticking   out   of   it .   very   easy   to   wipe   clean ,   no   worries   about   liquid   getting   into   the   circuitry .
smallspace   i   love   this   microwave .   it   is   the   perfect   size   for   a   small   space ,   it   looks   nice ,   and   it   cooks   well   for   a   750   watt .   the   first   one   i   received   would   not   latch   and   whirlpool   took   care   of   sending   me   a   new   one   and   picking   up   the   old   one ,   even   though   i   did   not   purchase   it   directly   from   them .
do   not   buy   this   microwave   i   was   in   a   hurry   to   purchase   a   microwave   after   mine   had   died .   i   didn   t   spend   any   time   researching   as   i   normally   do   and   made   an   on   the   spot   decision   at   the   store .   that   turned   in   to   a   huge   waste   of   time .   i   bought   the   microwave ,   brought   it   home   and   installed   it   only   to   find   that   it   was   a   lemon .   the   electronics   all   worked ,   however ,   when   plugging   it   in ,   the   fan   would   kick   on   while   the   tray   rotated   as   if   the   heat   sensor   was   bad .   as   a   result ,   the   unit   did   not   function .   br   br   i   should   have   known   after   reading   a   few   mediocre   reviews   while   i   was   in   the   store   to   stay   away .   my   desire   to   get   it   done   outweighed   common   sense .   br   br   the   microwave   is   in   the   box   being   returned   today   and   i   ll   have   to   do   it   again   and   likely   drill   new   holes .   i   don   t   plan   on   exchanging   for   the   same   model .
lemon   product   i   bought   this   less   than   three   years   ago .   i   seldom   use   it   to   heat   food .   i   only   used   it   for   light ,   fan   and   timer .   now ,   it   keeps   on   beeping   and   the   technician   said   it   will   cost   me   160   to   200   to   repair   it .
most   amazing   appliance   ever !   we   got   ours   three   years   ago   when   we   redid   our   appliances   and   it   has   been   the   workhorse   of   my   kitchen .   i   cook   everything   in   my   microwave   and   it   s   so   smart   it   knows   how   to   cook ,   defrost   or   reheat   everything !   it   has   been   durable   and   dependable ,   it   s   large   and   versatile .   i   have   only   had   to   replace   a   plate   i   m   a   klutz   and   the   handle   20   yr   old   doesn   t   know   his   own   strength   .   if   you   want   the   best   microwave   ever ,   get   it !
big   problem   have   owned   this   microwave   for   about   2.5   years .   has   been   a   great   performer   albeit   a   bit   longer   cooking   times   because   of   it   s   low   wattage .   however ,   about   6   months   ago   the   interior   paint   began   to   chip .   there   is   now   about   one   third   of   the   inside   paint   missing .   have   read   numerous   complaints   regarding   this   problem   on   other   sites   so   ours   is   not   an   isolated   incidence .   most   consumer   info   that   is   available   states   that   the   chipping   paint   is   not   unsafe .   i   don   t   know   about   you   but   i   don   t   prefer   my   food   with   paint   chips   in   it .   i   m   sure   soon   it   will   start   sparking   from   all   of   the   exposed   metal .   haven   t   replaced   it   yet   as   we   can   t   find   a   replacement   to   fit   our   space   requirements .
will   never   buy   whirlpool   again !   we   bought   this   microwave   in   the   summer   of   2011 .   it   did   not   heat   even   when   first   installed .   whirlpool   sent   a   repairman   who   fixed   it ,   only   after   three   months   of   work   and   making   several   orders   for   different   parts .   six   months   later ,   it   stopped   heating   again .   we   have   asked   for   a   replacement   but   whirlpool   will   only   send   the   repairman   again .   they   will   not   replace   the   product   even   though   we   have   been   unable   to   use   it   less   than   half   the   time   we   have   owned   it .   this   product   is   a   lemon   and   not   supported   by   the   manufacturer .   i   have   read   many   other   reviews   that   indicate   the   same   thing .   we   will   never   buy   whirlpool   or   any   other   brand   made   by   this   company   again !   we   desire   to   buy   american ,   but   not   at   the   cost   of   buying   inferior   products   from   a   company   with   lousy   customer   service !
no   brand   name   on   front   there   is   no   brand   name   of   the   front   of   this   appliance ,   which   is   nice   because   you   can   then   pair   it   with   your   other   appliances   that   may   be   a   different   brand .   which   in   my   case   was   whirlpool ... just   a   note   whirpool   and   amana   are   one   in   the   same .   br   i   had   it   installed   by   a   professional .   i   do   not   know   if   it   was   difficult   to   install .   this   is   not   a   direct   wire   appliance ,   you   will   need   an   outlet   in   the   cupboard   above   in   order   to   plug   it   in .   br   so   far   no   complaints .   i   have   not   had   much   time   to   use   it ... 1   week   since   installation .
sharp   convection   microwave   my   wife   wanted   this   item   after   conducting   a   great   deal   of   internet   research   on   it .   i   had   been   used   to   using   a   10   year   old   microwave   and   did   not   think   i   would   be   that   impressed   with   this   new   model .   i   was   wrong .   this   is   one   of   the   best   appliances   that   i   ve   ever   purchased .
dangerous   failure   mode   and   no   support   from   manufacturer   we   bought   this   frigidiare   microwave   in   the   hopes   of   getting   a   solid   over   the   range   microwave   to   use .   before   it   was   two   years   old   it   began   to   smoke   and   sputter   as   it   began   to   burn   up .   we   killed   the   power   and   shut   it   down .   we   contacted   frigidaire   and   were   told   it   was   out   of   warranty .   we   told   them   we   were   reporting   a   safety   hazard   that   they   should   be   aware   of .   we   were   told   that   it   was   impossible   for   the   microwave   to   do   what   ours   had   done .   no   support ,   rejection   of   safety   hazard   report ,   no   offer   of   repair   or   replacement .   br   br   we   think   you   will   regret   buying   this   product .   we   do .   complete   waste   of   money .
rg   absolutely   love   it !   takes   up   very   little   counter   space   large   inside ,   great   height ,   would   highly   recommend .   purchesed   for   a   cleaner   counter   look   and   that   is   exactly   what   i   have .   many   compliments   from   guests   everyone   wants   to   know   where   they   can   order   one .
oven   good .   installation   problematic .   i   had   an   older   ge   microwave   above   my   range   that   died   after   about   8   years .   when   looking   for   a   replacement   i   decided   to   go   for   another   similar   ge   in   order   to   swap   it   out   easily ,   figuring   it   would   use   similar   hardware .   that   was   my   first   mistake .   br   br   there   s   a   steel   plate   used   to   mount   the   oven   on   the   wall   plus   three   big   screws   that   go   in   from   the   cabinet   on   top .   not   only   is   the   plate   different   requiring   removal   of   old   installation   of   the   new   ,   not   only   are   the   anchor   points   in   different   places   requiring   new   holes   ,   but   they   re   placed   just   marginally   off   the   old   anchor   points .   meaning   that   the   integrity   of   the   wood   where   you   need   to   drill   is   compromised   from   the   old   screw   holes .   it   required   me   to   install   a   whole   new   shelf   in   the   upper   cabinet   as   well   as   trying   my   best   to   fill   the   old   stud   holes   with   wood   filler   and   hoping   it   would   be   strong   enough   when   i   re   drilled .   br   br   here   s   the   kicker ...   the   installation   hardware   comes   with   butterfly   screws   as   well   as   two   thick   wood   screws   for   mounting   to   the   wall   studs .   unfortunately ,   those   two   wood   screws   are   made   of   very   cheap   weak   metal .   i   pre   drilled   guide   holes   as   per   the   instructions ,   but   when   it   came   to   screwing   the   screws   in   the   heads   twisted   right   off   on   both   of   them   and   i   was   extra   careful   with   the   second   one   after   the   first   one   broke   .   the   screws   were   already   3   4   of   the   way   in ,   leaving   me   with   no   way   to   remove   them   and   blocking   the   ability   to   try   again   in   the   same   spot   a   spot   required   for   proper   installation   .   the   oven   isn   t   light ,   the   installation   requires   heavy   duty   hardware ,   why   ship   the   microwave   with   such   crappy   screws   br   br   lessons   br   br   buy   your   own   mounting   hardware .   br   when   it   comes   to   buying   a   replacement   appliance ,   there   s   no   value   in   nepotism .

exactly   what   i   wanted   after   installing   a   new   double   oven   to   replace   a   single   with   a   microwave   combo   i   was   left   in   need   of   a   countertop   microwave .   it   had   to   be   small   so   as   not   to   take   up   counterspace   and   i   needed   blue   display   lights   to   match   all   of   my   other   appliances   light   displays   things   like   that   annoy   me   .   black   or   silver ... all   my   appliances   are   stainless   and   my   granite   is   black .   this   is   perfect .   fits   in   the   corner   and   easy   to   use .   looks   like   an   odd   little   tv ... which   i   like   since   i   like   quirky   looking   things   that   do   their   job .   i   boght   several   other   microwaves   these   past   few   weeks   pure   stainless ... blck ... larger ... even   the   nostalgia   retro   one ... all   went   back ... this   one   is   perfect .   i   don   t   do   major   cooking   in   a   microwave   and   if   takes   a   few   seconds   longer ,   well ,   it   really   does   not   matter   as   we   are   all   in   too   big   of   a   rush   anyway  
size   matters   this   arrived   incredibly   fast   and   features   were   as   advertised .   however ,   do   be   aware   that   the   height   is   listed   as   15   and   1   2   and   this   was   a   primary   consideration   as   i   was   replacing   a   microwave   in   a   tight   space .   sure   enough ,   the   front   is   15   and   1   2   however ,   the   unit   slopes   to   16   and   1   2   at   the   back .

samsung   smh   9187st   i   brought   a   samsung   smh9187st   back   nov .   2010 ,   which   is   the   same   exact   microwave   as   the   smh   1816s   with   the   exaact   same   features   listed .   on   june   14 ,   2011 ,   i   had   a   technician   come   to   my   home   to   repair   this   unit .   this   unit   was   under   warranty   at   the   time .   on   may   6 , 2012 ,   samsung   microwave   display   se   on   the   screen .   call   samsung   office   and   they   referred   me   to   a   service   tech .   also ,   stating   the   unit   was   not   under   warranty   regardless   of   the   last   repair   date .   i   call   the   service   tech .   office   somewhere   in   norcross , ga . to   find   out   what   it   would   cost   for   a   visit   to   my   home .   the   office   employee   not   the   tech .   stated   the   tech .   visit   for   my   area   would   be   140.00   to   look   at   and   replace   the   unit   part   which   would   cost   75.00 .   total   cost   215.00   the   employee   that   was   not   a   tech .   quoted   me   the   cause   of   my   problem   and   the   part   that   cause   the   problem   without   some   even   looking   at   the   unit .   sounds   like   the   repair   company   already   have   a   lot   of   information   without   every   touching   or   looking   at   this   samsung   microwave   unit .   this   appears   to   be   an   on   going   problem   with   this   unit   even   though   the   on   thing   that   has   change   is   the   model   number   samsung   smh1816s .   br   if ,   you   have   not   had   a   problem   in   the   first   year   consider   yourself   lucky .   when   you   have   had   two   problems   in   18   months   with   this   unit   it   is   time   for   a   recall   on   your   product .   stay   away   from   this   microwave   unless   you   don   t   mind   an   inconvenience   and   spending   more   money .
good   for   the   first   2   years   broken   after   that   poor   quality   worked   great   for   the   first   2   years   than   completely   broken .   after   charging   me   99   to   look   at   my   microwave ,   the   ge   repairman   indicated   that   the   repair   would   cost   over   400 .   wow   what   a   ripoff .   i   expected   a   profile   to   last   a   little   longer   than   that .   if   you   want   to   replace   this   in   2   years   go   ahead   and   buy .   otherwise ,   look   for   a   brand   other   than   ge .
can   i   give   zero   stars   this   microwave   was   installed   by   our   builder   in   our   new   home   a   year   and   a   half   ago .   i   m   not   sure   why ,   as   i   have   since   found   out   that   the   service   technician   for   this   area   has   been   out   numerous   times   to   replace   these   microwaves .   ours   died   after   17   months   of   regular   use .   it   will   run   but   will   not   heat   anything .   i   called   whirlpool   to   troubleshoot   this ,   and   all   they   did   was   put   me   through   an   automated   call   that   set   up   a   service   appointment .   at   no   point   did   they   tell   me   what   this   service   call   would   cost .   so   i   had   to   call   back   and   get   a   customer   service   rep   who   told   me   it   would   be   129   for   someone   to   come   out   to   my   home .   that   of   course   does   not   include   any   parts   or   replacement .   i   can   buy   a   brand   new   microwave   that   works   from   a   better   company   for   twice   that .   why   would   i   fix   a   microwave   that   broke   in   a   little   over   a   year   of   use .   in   all   my   years   of   microwave   use ,   i   have   never   had   a   microwave   break .   it   s   pretty   ridiculous   to   me   to   have   it   break   in   a   little   over   a   year ,   especially   when   my   neighbor   had   hers   break   two   months   prior .   i   would   never   buy   a   whirlpool   appliance   again .

great   customer   service   while   under   warranty   warning   for   appliances ,   amazon . com   reviews   are   skewed   to   the   low   side .   most   people   who   write   appliance   reviews   do   so   because   their   apppliance   stopped   working   and   they   get   mad   and   want   to   take   it   out   on   the   company .   br   br   the   problem   most   microwaves   are   made   by   a   few   asian   companies .   ge   has   stopped   manufacturing   most   small   appliances   and   even   some   major   appliances .   many   of   the   ge   refridgerators   are   not   only   made   in   korea ,   they   were   designed   and   engineered   by   korea   and   only   have   a   ge   label   slapped   on   them .   the   expensive   ge   profile   microwaves   are   made   by   the   guys   who   make   the   panasonic   and   other   microwaves .   br   br   with   an   appliance   or   piece   of   electronics ,   it   can   be   the   luck   of   the   draw .   there   is   a   basic   reliablity   curve ,   called   the   bathtup   curve .   in   the   first   few   months   of   a   product   s   life ,   there   is   a   high   percentage   of   units   that   fail .   then ,   if   you   get   past   that ,   there   is   a   long   period   where   the   odds   of   your   product   failing   is   very   low ,   until   end   of   life   is   reached ,   maybe   10   to   20   years   later .   the   people   who   write   reviews   in   amazon   are   the   unfortunate   ones   who   products   fail   during   that   initial   period .   br   br   my   microwave   broke   after   4   months .   but ,   ge   customer   service   is   great .   i   called   them   up .   they   came   to   my   house   the   same   day .   it   needed   parts   the   repair   did   not   have   on   his   truck .   he   ordered   the   parts ,   which   came   2   days   later .   i   made   another   appointment   and   my   microwave   was   back   in   a   week .   br   br   this   microwave   is   big   inside .   i   don   t   know   how   imporantant   that   is .   we   can   put   big   plates   or   platters   in   it .   but ,   if   it   wasn   t   so   big ,   i   could   just   put   the   food   in   smaller   bowl .   br   br   it   has   lots   of   heating   options .   but ,   so   do   the   cheapest   microwaves .   personally ,   i   don   t   think   any   of   those   heating   options   are   of   any   value .   it   is   not   like   they   are   reliable   to   work   automatically .   with   any   microwave ,   you   experiment   a   couple   of   times   and   then   you   konw   what   setting   to   use .   br   br   really ,   there   are   only   3   important   features   for   amicrowave   br   br   1 .   how   it   looks .   i   think   this   looks   great .   br   br   2 .   power .   this   is   1200   watts   and   heats   food   fast .   i   wouldn   t   get   anything   under   1000   watts .   br   br   3 .   quality .   unfortunately ,   i   don   t   think   you   can   do   much   about   this .
working   fine   after   4   months   we   bought   this   mainly   because   it   had   to   be   the   same   size   as   our   old   one ,   to   fit   into   a   space   in   our   cabinets ,   and   this   was   the   closest .   a   bonus   was   the   turntable ,   which   my   husband   really   likes .   it   is   larger   inside   than   the   old   one ,   and   more   powerful ,   in   the   same   space !   we   have   used   it   4   months   now   with   no   issues   at   all .   the   door   does   close   and   open   rather   hard ,   so   we   ease   it   closed ,   otherwise   we   love   it !   the   controls   are   very   easy   to   use .   we   had   a   bit   of   trouble   installing   it ,   we   could   not   get   the   bottom   slots   in   the   microwave   to   slip   onto   the   bracket ,   so   we   just   bent   the   bottom   of   the   bracket   so   the   microwave   sits   on   on   it ,   and   it   is   screwed   to   the   cabinet   from   the   top .   a   good   choice   if   it   becomes   available   again .
better   than   expected   i   purchased   the   danby   as   a   gift   for   my   nephew   who   has   a   small   apartment .   i   selected   it   mainly   due   to   the   price   less   than   60   bucks   at   walmart   and   the   fact   that   it   takes   up   little   counter   space .   although   i   was   not   expecting   much   in   terms   of   features ,   i   ve   been   really   impressed   with   this .   br   br   it   offers   a   wide   range   of   programming   features .   there   are   6   one   touch   buttons   so   you   can   set   1   to   6   minutes   of   cooking   time   with   one   key   press .   it   also   has   an   add   30   seconds   feature   that   can   be   used   at   start   up   or   while   the   microwave   is   already   running .   there   are   also   a   host   of   timing   options   for   cooking   and   defrosting .   br   br   it   looks   really   nice   much   better   than   i   was   expecting .   pretty   decent   stainless   steel   trim   on   the   front   and   the   handle ,   and   a   black   casing .   looks   like   it   cost   a   lot   more .   easy   to   clean ,   and   the   handle   keeps   fingerprints   away   from   the   front .   one   difference   from   the   picture   the   key   pad   is   all   black ,   and   not   white   and   black   as   in   the   photo .   br   br   the   0.9   capacity   is   just   right .   i   also   have   a   0.7   capacity   machine ,   but   that   has   a   problem   with   any   dish   that   s   larger   than   11   inches .   the   0.9   gives   you   a   decent   amount   of   interior   space ,   but   doesn   t   take   up   much   more   counter   space   than   the   0.7 .   br   br   it   has   900   watts   of   power ,   and   does   a   good   job   of   heating   foods   quickly .   the   interior   light   is   bright   and   comes   on   when   the   unit   is   running   or   the   door   is   open .   reasonably   quiet   when   it   is   running   typical   noise   level   for   a   microwave .   br   br   can   t   speak   to   reliability   as   of   yet ,   but   it   comes   with   a   12   month   warranty   that   is   extended   to   18   months   if   you   register   it   online .   br   br   great   machine   if   you   re   looking   for   something   that   is   small ,   but   still   very   usable .   highly   recommend .
control   panel   dies   after   1   year   i   have   to   agree   with   the   other   1   star   review .   i   would   also   give   it   zero   stars   if   possible .   this   is   my   second   ge   microwave   that   has   died   after   one   year .   last   time   it   was   the   turntable   motor ,   this   time   it   was   the   control   panel .   of   course   the   replacement   is   over   125 .   they   produce   garbage .   no   more   ge   for   me .
love   it !   perfect   replacement   for   my   old   one .   it   is   deeper   than   my   old   one   but   not   to   an   extreme .   i   can   nuke   larger   items   now .
fits   a   need .   bought   to   fit   in   an   18   kitchen   base   cabinet ,   hidden   behind   a   door .   1000   watts   would   be   better ,   but   this   is   the   only   choice   for   my   requirements .   i   like   the   simple   controls ,   as   i   use   it   only   to   rewarm   leftovers   and   melt   butter   and   chocolate .
dead   after   1   year .   i   got   this   wine   cooler   as   a   gift .   looks   nice .   i   saw   the   reviews   and   assumed   that   the   machine   will   fail   after   a   few   months .   it   lasted   barely   more   than   a   year   and   a   half .   after   approximately   a   year   it   was   making   very   loud   noises   and   it   did   not   longer   cool .   i   use   it   as   a   wine   rack   off   but   will   bring   it   to   the   curve   one   of   this   days .   br   br   run   away .
reliable   i   ve   had   a   white   one   for   21   years .   i   had   to   install   a   new   cap   for   our   new   range   vent .   anything   that   lasts   that   long   with   no   maintenance   makes   the   purchase   decission   a   no   brainer .   only   issue   is   that   it   only   comes   in   black ,   but   a   rustoleum   white   spray   can   will   fix   that .   oh ,   and   it   s   kind   of   hard   to   find   in   stores .   finally   found   a   lowes   close   to   my   work   that   carried   it .
does   this   run   on   diesel   just   purchased   this   microwave   and   it   is   so   loud   that   it   seems   like   there   is   a   semi   tractor   trailer   idling   in   my   kitchen .   we   could   neither   hear   the   television   nor   have   a   normal   volumed   conversation   with   it   on .   everything   else   on   the   unit   seemed   great ,   but   won   t   get   to   explore   them   as   we   will   be   returning   it .
pure   junk   and   lousy   customer   service   buy   anything   else ,   just   don   t   buy   this   piece   of   junk .   multiple   electrical   problems ,   a   door   lock   that   failed ,   poor   performance   and   lousy   customer   service   all   at   a   premium   price .   you   can   buy   better   but   you   probably   can   t   pay   more .
cool   cooler !   i   bought   this   fridge   for   my   college   son   who   lives   on   his   computer .   the   only   setback   is   that   he   says   it   doesn   t   accomodate   larger   cans   of   drinks .   other   than   that ,   he   says   it   is   the   coolest   invention !
works   great !   i   received   the   item   before   the   expected   date   package   and   it   s   contents   were   intact ,   no   issues   at   all   with   delivery .   br   br   i   used   it   the   day   i   received   it   after   reading   the   many   helpful   hints   in   these   online   reviews ,   it   was   very   simple   and   easy   to   use .   it   works   great   for   me ,   for   small   loads   in   my   apartment   i   live   alone   and   don   t   have   large   amounts   of   laundry   to   wash .   br   br   the   tube   they   supply   to   fill   up   the   tub   didn   t   fit   onto   my   faucet ,   but   i   have   a   plastic   pitcher   i   used   to   fill   it   three   pitchers   full ,   easy   peasy   .   when   in   use ,   it   sits   right   on   my   kitchen   counter   and   the   drain   tube   empties   the   water   directly   into   my   sink .   the   panda   is   fairly   quiet ,   if   i   have   music   or   the   tv   on ,   i   can   t   hear   it   at   all .   br   br   it   s   really   been   a   huge   help   to   me ,   and   i   use   it   often .   i   am   planning   on   getting   a   mini   electric   dryer   as   well ,   then   i   will   only   have   to   visit   the   laundrymat   once   a   month ,   if   that .   i   highly   recommend   the   panda   it   s   just   so   darn   cute ,   and   works   like   a   charm   with   small   loads .
fine   it   is   the   right   price   but   it   is   not   the   same   size   as   it   says .   we   had   the   exact   same   one   just   a   little   older   and   this   one   was   slightly   smaller .   1   4   on   all   sides .
buy   it   to   entertain   friends   with   your   possessed   microwave !   this   microwave   has   had   one   problem   after   another   since   it   was   installed   close   to   a   year   ago .   it   s   prone   to   all   sorts   of   computer   malfunctions .   let   s   see   if   i   can   even   remember   them   all .   we   ve   had   it   start   up   again   after   pulling   food   out   and   closing   the   door   without   hitting   start   again   .   it   s   often   50   times   sounded   as   if   it   was   working ,   but   when   i   realized   it   had   been   an   awfully   long   time   without   it   chiming ,   i   found   that   it   had   frozen   just   a   few   seconds   into   the   heating .   the   most   disturbing   problem   was   that   it   has   on   perhaps   five   occasions   turned   on   on   its   own   with   no   one   in   the   room .   there   have   been   many   occasions   where   it   has   just   not   worked   at   all .   when   this   happened ,   unplugging   it   and   plugging   it   back   in   used   to   reset   it   so   that   it   would   work .   unfortunately ,   it   now   won   t   work   at   all ,   with   just   the   code ,   se   flashing   on   its   display .   br   br   we   re   buying   a   new   microwave   this   weekend ,   and   i   can   guarantee   it   won   t   be   a   samsung .
4   defective   ge   spacesaver   microwaves   in   16   months   in   january   2011   i   purchased   a   pem31smss   ge   spacesaver   microwave   because   it   was   the   only   microwave   with   400   watts   of   power   i   could   find   that   would   fit   in   the   space   i   have .   it   looked   nice   better   than   a   plain   black   box .   approximately   4   months   later   the   keypad   stopped   working   and   the   microwave   was   replaced   under   warranty .   in   august   of   2011   the   replacement   microwave   wouldn   t   turn   off ,   and   was   replaced   under   warranty .   in   march   of   2012   after   heating   a   cup   of   coffee ,   the   third   microwave   just   went   dark   and   wouldn   t   work   any   more .   the   stainless   model   was   no   longer   available   and   was   replaced   with   the   black ,   which   arrived   yesterday .   today   i   unpacked   it   and   plugged   it   in .   the   interior   light   won   t   turn   off   and   there   is   no   keyboard   response   when   i   press   the   start   button   because   something   in   the   latch   isn   t   making   contact .   i   think   i   ve   had   one   of   everything   that   could   go   wrong .   i   would   definately   not   recommend   purchasing   a   ge   spacemaker   microwave   of   any   style .
loving   this   microwave   picked   this   up   at   our   local   lowes   for   a   good   price .   this   model   has   the   real   stainless   handle ,   and   not   the   painted   grey   handle   i   saw   on   a   lower   end   model .   we   installed   it   with   minimal   problems   for   our   kitchen   out   of   the   1960   s   that   usually   has   non   standard   things   finding   a   fridge   that   fit   was   very   painful   .   we   needed   one   with   a   low   clearance   distance   to   the   cook   top   14   inches   or   less ,   and   samsung   meets   the   bill   at   13   inches .   after   using   a   counter   top   microwave   for   the   past   few   years ,   this   seems   huge .   i   m   still   learning   all   the   features ,   but   am   certainly   pleased   by   the   power   of   the   fan .   i   m   exploring   the   use   of   the   sensor   cooking   and   can   t   wait   to   use   the   rack   to   be   able   to   actually   cook   the   amount   of   squash   i   want   at   once   the   old   microwave   was   just   too   small .   i   ll   update   this   review   if   i   run   into   any   problems   as   we   run   it   through   it   s   paces ,   but   so   far   it   was   relatively   easy   to   install   and   is   easy   to   use .
extremely   disappointed   se   or   5e   keypad   problem   i   bought   this   microwave   based   on   the   consumer   reports   product   ratings   and   up   until   a   couple   of   days   ago   i   would   have   highly   recommended   it .   unfortunately   that   is   no   longer   the   case .   i   awoke   to   sounds   of   it   beeping   every   few   minutes   and   an   error   code   of   se .   after   a   lot   of   research   i   have   seen   that   this   same   code   has   appeared   for   a   fair   amount   of   others .   both   the   short   and   the   long   of   it   is   that   it   can   no   longer   be   used   with   out   spending   good   money   after   bad .   i   know   that   they   don   t   make   things   now   days   to   last   a   lifetime ,   but   i   would   have   hoped   for   it   to   last   longer   than   less   than   2   years .   we   are   light   users   and   i   kept   it   very   clean .   i   wish   that   i   would   have   bought   an   extended   warranty .   i   can   only   hope   that   i   go   the   same   way   this   did ... quick   and   without   warning   and   that   someone   would   also   say   she   was   good   while   she   lasted .
not   bad   not   many   reviews   about   this   danby   unit .   i   replaced   another   900   watt   hamilton   beach   unit   with   this   one .   the   main   reason   was   the   h   b   unit   light   was   off   when   the   door   was   opened .   aside   from   that   it   was   a   good   unit .   i   gave   it   away .   br   this   danby   does   have   the   interior   light   on   when   you   open   the   door .   this   makes   it   easier   to   remove   hot   beverages   without   fumbling   and   spills .   it   is   somewhat   louder   than   the   old   one .   it   makes   a   humming   noise   when   running .   all   make   some   noise ,   but   this   is   almost   annoying .   br   br   at   900   watts   you   can   expect   moderate   cook   times .   the   table   turns   slower   than   others .   the   old   one   made   one   revolution   in   10   seconds .   this   one   takes   about   13   seconds .   no   big   deal ,   but   when   heating   a   cup   of   coffee ,   the   handle   might   be   in   the   rear   of   the   oven   when   finished   heating .   in   other   words ,   it   was   easier   to   use   multiples   of   10   like   60   seconds   and   have   the   handle   of   a   cup   right   there   in   front .   br   br   aside   from   that   it   runs   fine .   no   comment   on   quality   since   it   too   new   to   judge .   at   these   lower   prices   they   are   pretty   much   throw   aways   when   they   die .   like   the   other   reviewer   this   unit   was   purchased   at   walmart .   i   buy   lots   from   amazon   and   have   alwaye   been   highly   satisfied   with   service   and   products .   it   was   simply   cheaper   at   73   total   price   with   tax .
dies   after   3   years   always   had   sharp   microwaves   the   first   one   lasted   about   10   years ,   this   model   lasted   3   and   died   today .   the   lights   are   on ,   the   timer   goes   down   but   no   turntable ,   no   fan ,   just   doesnt   work .   br   i   know   they   wont   last   forever   but   3   years   is   a   bit   too   less .
magnatron   failure   bought   a   sharp   microwave   drawer   one   and   a   half   years   ago .   barely   used   it   warming   leftovers   once   a   week   and   softening   butter   a   few   times .   started   to   make   funny   noises   and   gave   off   an   electrical   smell .   because   i   bought   it   from   an   american   supplier   sharp   canada   is   saying   i   have   no   warranty   and   suggest   that   i   send   the   microwave   to   a   family   member   in   the   us   to   have   it   repaired .   this   is   ludicrous .   sharp   us   says   i   have   to   deal   with   sharp   canada .   to   get   it   repaired   here   it   will   cost   286 .   either   way   it   will   cost   a   small   fortune   to   repair .
a   lemon   asin   b000uw1ww8   ge   profile   jes2251sj   2.2   cu .   ft .   countertop   microwave   with   child   lockout   and   extra   large   br   capacity   br   i   purchased   this   product   less   than   two   years   ago   today   it   finally   just   stopped . this   was   considered   a   very   good   micro ,   however   it   should   have   lasted   much   longer .   i   no   longer   have   any   faith   in   ge   products   and   would   never   recomend   this   product   to   anyone !
worst   ever !   after   owning   this   microwave   for   less   than   3   years ,   we   have   had   the   door   handle   break   off   on   the   bottom   twice !   the   first   time   we   had   it   fixed   which   cost   nearly   as   much   as   the   microwave .   this   was   just   over   1   year   after   purchasing   of   course ,   because   it   was   no   longer   under   warranty   .   now ,   just   over   three   years   in ,   it   has   broken   off   again   exact   same   problem .   oh ,   and   the   glass   on   the   front   of   the   door   somehow   came   undone   on   the   top   and   fell   down   about   two   inches .   absolutely   the   worst   appliance   we   have   ever   owned .   i   have   also   had   problems   with   my   lg   dryer   after   less   than   4   years   of   owning   it .   lg   should   track   down   everyone   who   purchased   this   microwave   and   give   them   a   refund .   i   will   never ,   ever   buy   another   lg   product   again ,   no   matter   what   type .
my   sharp   r   520ks2   cubic   foot   1200   watt   microwave   this   is   the   first   1 , 200   watt   microwave   i   ve   ever   owned .   it   took   just   a   while   to   figure   out   i   didn   t   need   things   to   heat   as   long ,   but   once   i   figured   it   out ,   it   is   the   best   microwave   i   ve   ever   owned .   the   only   drawback   i   have   is   i   wish   the   completed   beeper   was   louder .   other   than   that ,   i   am   thoroughly   satisfied   with   this   microwave .
excellent   until   paint   peeled   we   ve   had   ours   probably   an   older   model   since   2004 .   paint   in   the   back   just   peeled   and   it   s   doing   some   sparking .   be   careful ,   everyone .
good   looks ,   poor   function   if   you   put   something   in   this   microwave   that   is   too   tall   its   easy   to   do   because   it   doesn   t   have   the   same   height   as   a   regular   microwave   it   will   knock   it   over   when   the   motorized   door   closes .   it   also   does   not   have   a   spinning   turn   table   so   you   have   to   rotate   food .   initially   thought   the   motorized   door   was   cool ,   but   it   takes   a   few   extra   seconds   to   open   and   close   which   can   be   frustrating .
failure   at   16   months   our   jes2251sj02   lasted   4   months   past   the   12   month   warranty .   the   inverter   blew   and   the   cost   for   a   replacement   inverter   was   225 ,   a   new   jes2251sj02   is   258   so   were   trashing   it .   ge   is   sending   us   a   100   credit   check   good   only   for   another   ge   appliance .   the   repair   man   recommended   buying   the   cheapest   microwave   available   and   getting   the   extended   warranty   on   any   appliance .   everything   out   there   is   trash ,   said   he .   i   m   afraid   he   is   right .
a   bit   noisy   everything   so   far   seems   to   be   working   great .   we   ve   only   owned   it   for   a   few   weeks   but   other   than   it   being   just   a   bit   noisier   than   the   old   one   we   replaced ,   we   are   very   happy   with   it .   also   the   power   is   the   same   as   the   one   we   replaced   it   for   but   it   seems   to   take   about   15   20   longer   cooking   time   than   the   old   one .   the   size   of   the   microwave   is   larger   than   the   old   one ,   so   maybe   that   is   the   reason   it   takes   longer   to   cook .   other   than   that   i   would   still   buy   the   same   microwave   over   again   if   i   had   to   do   it   all   over   again .   great   deal   for   the   money .
peeling   paint   yikes !   after   just   two   and   a   half   years   of   use ,   the   paint   is   it   really   paint   is   peeling   off   the   inside   top   in   large   pieces .   no   doubt   we   ve   eaten   more   unnoticeable   bits .   the   microwave   is   built   in .   anybody   find   a   better   one   with   the   same   dimensions  
expensive   but   a   good   buy   we   bought   this   oven   based   upon   our   son   s   usage   of   an   earlier   model .   there   aren   t   that   many   drawer   microwaves   available .   why   buy   a   drawer   microwave   well ,   the   most   important   reason   is   that   my   wife   wanted   one   in   our   new   house !   her   arguments   were   as   follows   1   no   need   to   lift   or   inspect   foods   over   her   head ,   2   made   space   for   a   vent .   while   microwaves   can   generally   be   vented   from   the   front   or   the   above   top   ,   our   new   house   didn   t   have   any   vent .   so ,   all   cooking   fumes   were   vented   into   the   room .   with   this   oven ,   we   removed   the   cabinet   above   the   existing   microwave   and   installed   a   stainless   steel   vent   hood   above   the   range   .   still ,   not   perfectly   ventalated .   i   had   to   modify   a   base   cabinet   near   the   stove   to   accept   the   drawer   microwave .   not   a   problem   for   me   as   i   am   a   woodworker ,   but   a   problem   or   extra   costs   for   others .   in   addition ,   i   had   to   add   an   electrical   outlet .   not   a   problem   for   me   as   i   am   a   retired   electrical   engineer ,   but   maybe   a   cost   for   others .   after   the   installation ,   simple   enough ,   the   drawer   didn   t   want   to   stay   closed .   that   is ,   you   push   the   close   button   and   the   drawer   closed   but   re   opened   immediately .   i   was   about   to   call   for   service   but   i   did   the   following   push   the   drawer   closed   manually ,   that   is   by   hand .   this   seemed   to   work   and   then   the   automatic   closure   mechanism   started   working   okay .   so ,   no   service   call   required .   the   only   shortcomings   i   see   are   that   the   power   is   not   as   great   as   our   prior   microwave   and   that   there   isn   t   a   rotating   table .   dispite   this ,   we   are   happy   with   this   model   so   far   after   about   a   year .   shorter   people   may   like   this   oven   a   lot ,   and ,   it   is   really   cool !   so ,   i   would   recommend   this   oven .
whirlpool   losing   reliablility   bought   a   whirlpool   over   the   range   microwave   and   in   less   than   six   months   needed   a   new   magnetron .   it   was   repaired   at   no   cost   under   warranty   but   rattles   like   it   s   ten   years   old .   bought   a   used   small   sharp   micro   at   least   ten   years   old ,   it   works   quietly   and   probably   will   outlast   the   whirlpool .   their   refrigerators   also   are   sub   par .   dispenses   warm   water   before   it   is   cold ,   door   shelf   flimsy   and   falls   off   easily .   no   gallon   storage   in   door   and   shelves   cannot   be   placed   without   checking   that   the   door   will   close .   and ,   finally ,   the   less   than   one   year   old   kitchenaid   disposal   quit   after   jamming   constantly ,   replaced   with   a   quiet   insinkerator .   yes ,   kitchenaid   is   owned   by   whirlpool .
perfect   for   a   small   kitchen   i   love   this   microwave .   it   takes   up   barely   any   space   on   the   counter ,   and   the   cord   is   well   hidden   behind   it .   it   works   fine   for   just   heating   things   up   and   defrosting .   the   only   thing   to   be   aware   of   is   that   this   really   is   a   tiny   microwave .   you   can   fit   a   full   size   dinner   plate ,   but   there   is   not   a   lot   of   height   inside .   i   couldn   t   use   my   microwave   rice   cooker   in   this   because   it   was   too   tall ,   so   i   had   to   purchase   a   counter   top   rice   cooker   instead ,   which   doesn   t   seem   to   work   as   well .   other   than   that ,   this   microwave   looks   good   on   the   counter   and   does   the   job .
about   out   of   warranty   and   have   already   had   two   service   calls   i   ve   had   two   service   calls   with   this   microwave   within   the   one   year   warranty .   if   it   goes   again ,   they   tell   me   i   am   on   my   own .   shame   on   whirlpool .   i   suspect   that   it   may   be   more   efficient   to   purchase   a   new   microwave   instead   of   having   a   service   call   for   a   circuit   board   that   continues   to   be   an   issue .   i   d   steer   away   from   this   one ....
2nd   try   and   fail   we   moved   into   a   house   that   already   had   the   mco160uw   microwave   oven   installed .   after   a   few   months   the   microwave   would   stop   working   and   then   randomly   run   on   by   its   self   for   3   minutes   and   30   seconds .   after   deciding   the   microwave   needed   to   be   replaced   for   safety   reasons   we   looked   for   another .   we   purchased   one   with   the   same   length   and   width   but   after   installing   it   realized   the   adjacent   cabinet   door   wouldnt   open   since   it   is   at   an   angle   due   to   the   microwave   sticking   out   too   far   from   the   wall .   the   standard   size   is   16   deep   and   up .   anything   over   15   deep   will   stick   out   too   far   for   the   cabinet   to   open   and   the   only   microwave   available   anywhere   with   14.9   depth   was   this   one .   we   desperately   needed   a   new   microwave   so   decided   to   give   this   same   model ,   mco160uw ,   a   second   try   it   failed   again   after   1   week   of   use .   it   will   not   run   longer   than   1   minute   and   30   seconds   at   a   time   until   it   shuts   off .   in   order   to   use   it   again   you   must   wait   a   few   minutes   for   it   to   turn   back   on .   i   do   not   recommend   this   product .
satisfied   the   haier   microwave   was   exactly   as   discribed   and   installed   easily .   it   replaced   a   10yo   hotpoint   over   the   counter   which   began   the   fail   and   finally   threw   electrial   flashes   and   died .   as   a   low   cost   replacement ,   the   haier   was   the   best   i   could   find .
whirlpool ... never   again ! ! !   last   evening   when   i   went   to   open   the   door   on   my   whirlpool   microwave   convection   hood   unit ,   which   is   about   26   months   old ,   the   handle   cracked   through   completely ,   leaving   it   hanging   by   whatever   supports   the   top   of   the   handle   screws ,   i   assume   .   soooo ,   today   i   called   whirlpool   to   discuss   the   problem ... the   first   person   that   i   spoke   with   offered   me   a   contract   for   285   that   she   said   would   cover   the   service   call ,   all   parts   labor ,   plus   would   give   me   warranty   coverage   for   1   year .   since   the   service   call   was   going   to   be   129 ,   i   accepted   the   285   offer   which   i   had   to   accept   within   24   hours   or   it   would   not   be   offered   to   me   again   .   after   verifying   at   least   3   times   that   this   would   cover   all   expenses   incurred ,   i   gave   her   my   credit   card   and   she   transferred   me   to   what   was   to   be   the   service   appointment   scheduling   extension   actually ,   it   was   the   extended   warranty   department ,   who   told   me   that   this   285   contract   did   not   cover   handles ,   knobs ,   etc ... one   hour   later   was   i   frustrated   by   this   or   what   still   on   the   phone ,   having   been   transferred   at   least   6   times   each   person   i   spoke   with   had   the   same   message ... i   apologize   .   i   didn   t   want   any   more   apologies ... i   wanted   action ! ! !   the   only   action   i   got   after   finally   speaking   with   a   supervisor   was   that   i   could   cancel   the   contract   as   if   i   didn   t   know   this   much   ,   but   it   would   take   a   few   days   to   have   my   credit   card   credited .   oh ,   when   i   told   one   of   the   6   people   i   spoke   with   during   that   hour   that   i   googled   this   problem   and   found   that   i   was   not   the   only   one   that   experienced   this ,   she   told   me   that   competitors   post   those   comments   on   amazon . com ... grrrrr .   i   need   to   replace   a   dishwasher ,   stove ,   refrigerator ... they   won   t   be   whirlpool .
love   this   unit   i   ve   had   this   microwave   for   a   year   now ,   and   it   has   performed   flawlessly .   it   also   looks   great ,   and   is   very   easy   to   clean ,   inside   and   out .   the   best   thing   is   the   one   touch   start   for   things   like   tea   and   re   heating .   i   don   t   feel   like   i   have   to   program   a   computer   just   to   make   something   to   eat .
good   product   good   quality   product .   installed   well   and   works   great .   some   reviewers   commented   on   the   way   the   door   closes ,   but   i   have   found   it   to   be   just   fine .   hopefully   it   will   last   a   long   time .   i   would   recommend .   3   2013   update   the   microwave   has   worked   flawlessly   for   the   past   year .   very   pleased   with   it .   with   lots   of   use   and   much   by   teenagers ,   it   has   shown   to   be   sturdy   and   solidly   built   thus   far .   it   also   cooks   very   efficiently .   still   happy   and   would   still   recommend .
disfunctional   microwave   this   microwave   stopped   working   364   days   after   we   bought   the   house .   unfortunately   it   was   the   firday   before   a   holiday   weeked   and   i   was   not   able   to   contact   whrilpool   until   the   following   week .   whrilpool   refused   to   honor   the   warranty   when   i   called   becasue   it   was   two   day   expired .   a   service   repair   man   then   came   to   the   house   to   diagnose   the   problem .   he   told   me   the   the   microwave   needed   an   new   magnetron   and   control   board .   however ,   he   said   me   that   i   should   just   get   a   different   microwave .   if   i   replaced   the   parts   in   this   microwave   he   would   probably   be   back   in   another   year   becuase   whrilpool   had   so   many   problems   with   this   model .   after   that   recommendation   i   looked   at   reviews   on   the   whrilpool   web   sight   and   amazon ,   defective   magnetrons   seem   to   be   a   problem   with   this   unit .   i   would   not   recommend   purchasing   this   unit   since   it   seems   that   there   is   a   problem   with   functionality   and   their   warranty   department   is   unwilling   to   budge   on   anything .
great   microwave   this   is   a   great   microwave .   it   works   great   and   it   looks   beautiful .   i   actually   purchased   mine   online   from   walmart ,   but   i   order   from   amazon   alot   and   wanted   to   put   my   review   here   for   all   of   you .   i   ve   had   mine   almost   2   months   now .   it   has   a   3   prong   grounding   plug .   it   s   900   watts   and   heats   things   up   a   lot   faster   than   my   other   microwave ,   so   i   m   still   getting   use   to   that .   i   m   going   to   try   and   address   everything   i   see   people   asking   questions   about .   first   off ,   when   you   hit   a   number ,   for   example   2 ,   it   will   automatically   start   cooking   2   minutes .   you   can   press   the   start   button   and   add   30   seconds .   if   you   want   a   specific   time ,   for   example   3   minutes   and   45   seconds ,   you   can   press   the   power   button ,   then   the   numbers ,   3 , 4 ,   and   5 .   it   will   start   cooking   3   min .   45   secs .   it   has   a   lot   of   buttons   for   specific   items   like   popcorn ,   pizza ,   dinner   plate ,   defrost ,   etc .   it   has   a   normal   hum   when   running .   it   has   a   turntable .   the   clock   is   displayed   in   green .   it   beeps   5   times ,   not   super   loud   but   loud   enough ,   then   stops .   the   light   comes   on   when   you   open   the   door   and   while   cooking .   it   has   an   easy   to   use   child   safety   lock   to   lock   the   door .   i   ve   not   had   any   problems   with   fingerprints   on   the   exterior . the   handle   pulls   easily .   it   has   a   nice   weight   to   it .   i   have   mine   on   a   cabinet   with   grip   bottom   shelving   paper   under   it ,   so   i   don   t   know   if   it   would   slide   on   a   smooth   surface   or   not ,   mine   doesn   t .   the   inside   dimensions   are   12   in .   wide ,   12   in .   deep ,   and   8   in .   high .   the   turntable   plate   is   10   1   2   in .   plenty   of   room   for   most   things   you   microwave .   for   the   outside   dimensions ,   the   width   side   to   side   is   19   in . ,   the   height   is   11   1   2   in .   the   outside   dimensions   given   for   depth   includes   the   slight   protrusion   in   back   and   the   handle .   the   actual   microwave   is   13   in   deep   without   the   handle   and   protrusion   in   the   back .   here   s   the   best   way   to   let   you   know   the   depth   to   know   if   it   will   fit   on   your   shelf   or   wherever   else   you   put   it .   i   have   my   microwave   sitting   on   a   cabinet   which   is   1   in .   from   the   wall .   i   have   it   sitting   1   1   2   in .   from   the   back   of   the   cabinet .   the   actual   protrusion   is   about   1   in   from   the   back   of   the   cabinet .   there   are   vents   in   the   back   and   on   the   side   opposite   the   handle   left   side   if   you   re   facing   the   microwave   plus   the   protrusion ,   so   it   needs   some   space .   this   means   i   have   it   2   1   2   in .   total   from   the   wall .   it   comes   out   15   in .   from   the   back   of   my   cabinet .   the   front   legs   sit   back   2   1   2   in . ,   which   means   that   it   is   12   1   2   in .   from   the   back   of   my   cabinet   to   the   front   legs .   so ,   if   your   shelf   is   12   1   2   in .   deep ,   the   legs   would   all   fit   on   the   shelf   with   the   protrusion   being   1   in .   from   the   back   of   your   shelf .   i   have   the   extra   inch   from   the   back   of   the   cabinet   to   the   wall ,   so   if   you   don   t ,   you   might   need   your   shelf   to   be   at   least   13   to   13   1   2   in .   deep   to   give   you   more   vent   space .   i   think   this   covers   everything .   i   think   you   ll   be   satisfied   if   you   purchase   this   microwave . from   the   back   of   the   cabinet .   the   actual   protrusion   is   about   1   in   from   the   back   of   the   cabinet .   there   are   vents   in   the   back   and   on   the   side   opposite   the   handle   left   side   if   you   re   facing   the   microwave   plus   the   protrusion ,   so   it   needs   some   space .   this   means   i   have   it   2   1   2   in .   total   from   the   wall .   it   comes   out   15   in .   from   the   back   of   my   cabinet .   the   front   legs   sit   back   2   1   2   in . ,   which   means   that   it   is   12   1   2   in .   from   the   back   of   my   cabinet   to   the   front   legs .   so ,   if   your   shelf   is   12   1   2   in .   deep ,   the   legs   would   all   fit   on   the   shelf   with   the   protrusion   being   1   in .   from   the   back   of   your   shelf .   i   have   the   extra   inch   from   the   back   of   the   cabinet   to   the   wall ,   so   if   you   don   t ,   you   might   need   your   shelf   to   be   at   least   13   to   13   1   2   in .   deep   to   give   you   more   vent   space .   i   think   this   covers   everything .   i   think   you   ll   be   satisfied   if   you   purchase   this   microwave .
think   twice   before   buying   i   bought   this   microwave   oven   on   june   1st   2010 .   the   handle   is   broken   apart   and   the   handle   is   loose   also   the   bottom   of   the   doors   have   a   crack .
a   600.00   lemon   i   am   completely   disappointed   in   this   microwave .   it   stopped   working   after   about   16   months ,   hence   it   was   beyond   warranty .   every   microwave   i   have   ever   owned   has   lasted   at   least   5   years !   now   whirlpool   wants   to   charge   me   100.00   service   fee   this   despite   all   of   the   documented   magnetron   issues   in   the   reviews ,   yet   they   claim   to   not   have   any   documented   problems   with   this   model .   do   not   purchase   a   microwave   from   whirlpool .   it   s   beautiful   to   look   at ,   but   now   it   s   just   a   giant   pricey   paperweight   hanging   above   my   range .   i   ll   never   buy   anything   from   them   again !   it   doesn   t   deserve   a   star ,   and   neither   does   whirlpool   s   customer   service !
turns   itself   on !   i   had   been   using   this   microwave   for   only   about   two   years   when   it   suddenly   began   turning   itself   on !   really   scary ! !   a   bad   fire   hazard ,   and   i   have   found   others   who   report   the   same   phenomenon   with   the   same   model .   wondering   why   it   has   not   been   recalled   and   who   to   lodge   a   complaint   with ! !
miserable   plastics .   we   owned   this   unit   over   3   years .   the   electronics   went   bad   after   a   year .   it   took   6   tries   to   get   it   working .   as   reported   elsewhere   in   these   reviews ,   the   machine   would   turn   on   all   by   itself .   scary   and   dangerous .   whirlpool   would   not   replace   the   unit .   i   wonder   why   these   units   weren   t   recalled .   the   plastic   parts   not   a   stainless   steel   unit   distorted   and   cracked   in   several   places .   those   parts   were   replaced   under   a   separate   warranty   contract   3   times !   the   unit   again   has   cracks   and   no   warranty .   last   week ,   the   bottom   part   of   the   door   handle   pulled   out   of   the   unit   it   s   held   in   by   a   small   rubber   flange   that   is   sandwiched   between   the   outer   glass   and   an   inner   flat   plastic   piece .   websites   tell   me   that   the   glass   must   be   disassembled   to   get   a   new   handle   inserted !   gad !   it   s   outta   here .   and   the   real   shame   is   that   the   cooking   functions   are   excellent .   but   the   next   one   will   not   be   a   whirlpool ,   nor   any   other   of   whirlpool   brands .   whirlpool   makes   owns   whirlpool ,   kitchenaid ,   admiral ,   amana ,   jenn   air ,   magic   chef ,   and   maytag .  
be   warned   frigidaire   is   a   really   bad   brand ,   and   customer   service   is   worse   update   jan   21 ,   2012   just   when   i   thought   my   experience   with   frigidaire   could   not   get   any   worse ,   it   in   fact   did .   having   the   warranty   is   worse   than   not   having   one .   the   microwave   is   not   working   from   just   around   christmas .   early   january ,   it   should   have   been   fixed .   the   service   company   called   and   told   me   that   the   parts   are   not   available ,   so   the   next   possible   touch   point   is   feb   18th .   so ,   looking   at   guaranteed   no   microwave   for   about   2   months ,   and   even   after   that   there   is   uncertainty   when   it   would   be   fixed .   had   i   not   had   the   warranty ,   i   would   have   just   taken   a   loss   and   gone   ahead   an   purchased   another   microwave   of   a   brand   called   not   frigidaire .   this   microwave   lasted   less   than   6   months   of   course   you   think   all   should   be   fine   because   it   is   under   warranty .   yes ,   it   is   under   warranty ,   but   a   you   are   given   the   direct   contact   of   a   service   provider ,   and   you   are   no   longer   working   with   frigidaire   directly .   b   so ,   the   buck   is   passed   from   frigidaire   over   to   a   third   party   appliance   service   company   c   the   appliance   service   company   guy   came ,   took   a   look   at   the   microwave   and   said   they   will   need   to   order   parts   either   from   their   local   supplier ,   or   directly   from   distributor .   this   could   take   up   to   10   days   so ,   now   you   are   left   hanging   without   a   microwave   for   10   days   or   more .   with   the   time   off   needed   to   be   away   from   office   to   handle   the   multiple   appliance   service   company   appointments ,   the   warranty   is   just   not   worth   it .   also ,   called   frigidaire   customer   service .   the   customer   service   person   was   terrible ,   and   basically   told   me   to   deal   with   it   and   stop   complaining .   never   again   will   i   buy   a   frigidaire   product .
very   good   value   i   ordered   this   microwave   to   replace   my   15   year   old   ge   microwave   vent   hood   which   had   finally   given   up   the   ghost   after   multiple   repairs   .   i   was   pleased   that   i   could   install   it   myself   using   the   templates   and   instructions   included .   it   has   fewer   features   than   the   expensive   model   it   replaced   but   it   works   quite   well   and   includes   all   the   important   features   including   the   ability   to   use   the   existing   vent   or   to   vent   into   the   room .
worked   for   less   than   1   year   mounting   an   over   the   range   microwave   is   a   pain .   the   price   is   not   worth   replacing   the   unit   every   10   11   months .   buy   something   else .
great   microwave   this   item   works   great ,   was   pretty   easy   to   install   and   matches   our   kitchen .   exactly   what   it   says   in   the   description ,   arrived   on   time .   we   have   no   complaints   whatsoever   with   this   item .   i   would   definitely   recommend   it !
good   price   for   basic   features   i   bought   this   particular   microwave   oven   because   it   would   fit   in   the   space   over   our   stove   and   the   price   was   very   good .   it   s   worked   well ,   without   any   problems   since   i   bought   it   a   few   months   ago .   my   only   complaint   is   that   you   can   t   have   the   timer   going   and   cook   something   in   the   microwave   at   the   same   time .   i   ve   never   had   a   microwave   that   couldn   t   do   that   so   that   s   a   little   disappointing .
great   microwave   i   looked   everywhere   for   this   microwave .   i   had   the   same   one   a   few   years   ago   and   wanted   the   same   one   in   white   because   i   wanted   to   match   it   with   my   new   kitchen .   it   is   not   too   big   nor   too   small .   it   was   the   perfect   depth   for   my   shelf   in   my   kitchen .   reliable   appliance !
not   exactly   what   i   was   expecting   i   purchased   this   microwave   to   match   other   frigidaire   appliances   i   have ,   with   price   in   mind .   i   missed   that   you   don   t   have   the   ability   to   turn   off   the   turntable   on   this   model   it   seems   like   that   should   be   standard   anymore .   if   you   are   cooking   in   something   too   large   to   make   the   rotation ,   the   turntable   function   can   be   damaged .   i   m   not   used   to   having   to   push   a   cook   time   button   before   selecting   the   time .   i   ll   get   used   to   that ,   though .   it   gives   three   long   beeps   when   the   time   is   up ,   which   is   kind   of   annoying   to   me   for   some   reason .   even   when   you   open   the   door ,   the   beeps   continue .   i   haven   t   used   it   much   yet .   i   tried   the   popcorn   feature ,   and   it   needed   at   least   another   minute   of   cooking   time   beyond   what   that   is   preset   for .   i   like   that   you   can   add   30   seconds   with   the   touch   of   a   button .   but   if   i   d   had   more   time   home   construction   it   arrived   and   was   installed   right   away   and   had   purchased   it   locally   where   it   would   be   easy   to   return ,   i   would   have   returned   it   and   opted   for   a   different   model .   it   looks   nice ,   and   i   m   sure   it   will   be   fine .
good   for   a   basic   microwave   noisy   though   this   looks   good   and   does   what   it   is   designed   to   do .   my   main   niggle   about   this   is   that   it   is   rather   noisy ,   but   as   i   only   really   use   it   for   short   periods   anyway   no   more   than   4   minutes   at   a   time   it   is   no   big   deal .
very   disappointed   with   its   reliability   i   had   this   installed   when   i   did   my   first   kitchen   remodel   about   6   years   ago .   then   all   of   a   sudden   in   april   of   2009 ,   the   unit   stopped   working .   everything   else   was   fine   except   that   it   would   not   heat   the   food .   it   would   even   make   all   the   noise   and   so   on .   so ,   i   had   to   replace   it ,   and   decided   to   just   buy   a   new   one   and   reinstall   it .   to   my   horror ,   less   than   2.5   years   later ,   i   have   the   exact   same   failure .   on   top   of   this ,   if   you   need   any   repair   service ,   they   charge   you   a   minimum   of   100   to   just   come   and   diagnose   and   on   top   of   that   charge   you   for   parts   and   labor !   i   am   so   unhappy   and   furious   for   this   to   have   happened   twice   in   a   row .   i   will   never   again   buy   anything   from   ge ! ! !   and   charging   almost   40   of   the   price   of   a   new   unit   just   for   someone   showing   up   at   your   door   is   quite   silly .
8   years   old   and   still   great   after   reading   the   specs ,   my   husband   measured   the   height   before   installing .   we   replaced   the   cabinet   over   the   stove   to   a   shorter   cabinet   we   were   remodelling   the   kitchen   ,   so   we   have   none   of   the   problems   with   the   heat   on   the   latching   mechanism   other   people   mentioned .   i   love   all   of   the   features   on   this   microwave   especially   the   sensor   cooking   ,   it   was   easy   to   install ,   and   after   8   years   my   only   complaint   is   that   the   led   readout   has   completely   burned   out ,   so   my   cooking   is   now   by   braile .   i   was   checking   amazon   to   see   how   much   money   to   replace   this   microwave   and   was   really   surprised   by   the   reviews .   i   will   purchase   this   product   again   when   it   finally   quits   working .
can   t   i   give   magic   chef   a   minus   rating   microwave   mco165uw   over   heats   and   turns   off .   first   week   had   repairman   out ,   ordered   parts ,   after   3   weeks   magic   chef   still   had   not   sent   parts ,   sent   them   2   day .   repairman   came   back   out   and   replaced   parts .   still   overheated .   magic   chef   said   heat   water   if   it   does   not   turn   off   it   works   like   it   is   suppose   to .   cannot   steam   vegetables ,   cook   baked   potatoes   and   so   forth .   who   buys   a   microwave   just   to   heat   water   do   yourself   a   favor   and   never   buy   magic   chef .
believe   the   warnings !   my   story   is   so   similar   to   the   other   reviews .   bought   mine   in   3   2008   loved   it   worked   fabulous   for   about   a   year .   just   to   the   end   of   the   warranty .   whirlpool   s   response   to   my   request   for   warranty   service   at   13   months   on   a   top   of   the   line   appliance   was   tough   luck   you   should   have   bought   our   warranty .   i   got   it   fixed   200 .   then   i   bought   the   warranty   125 .   two   months   later ,   it   was   down   again .   over   3   months ,   and   4   appointments ,   they   replaced   nearly   every   interior   part .   finally   it   was   fixed   again .   two   weeks   later ..... it   is   down   again .   very   disappointing .
worked   fine   for   8   years   until   paint   peeled   i   have   had   no   problem   with   the   microwave   everything   has   worked   well   since   i   bought   the   house   6   years   ago ,   when   the   microwave   was   already   2   years   old .   the   paint   just   now   started   to   peel   on   the   inside   roof   of   the   microwave ,   and   since   i   am   told   that   is   problematic   for   paint   chips   in   the   food   and   for   interfering   with   the   magnetron ,   i   need   to   replace   the   unit .   i   have   the   same   problem   as   others   who   have   posted   reviews   my   kitchen   has   custom   cabinets   with   a   space   for   this   size   unit .   i   could   remove   my   stove   hood   and   fit   an   over   the   stove   microwave   fan   unit ,   but   that   would   leave   a   hole   where   the   current   unit   is   located ,   and   i   would   need   to   buy   a   custom   cabinet   for   the   hole .   seems   like   a   lot   of   cost   to   just   replace   a   microwave .   has   anyone   found   another   similarly   sized   unit   or   had   ge   fixed   the   obvious   paint   defect   that   is   an   obvious   problem   with   this   model  
good   buy   it   works
ministerdwf   wow ,   wow ,   wow !   i   was   somewhat   concerned   about   purchasing   a   microwave   over   the   internet ,   but   how   great   it   was .   i   was   even   more   than   satisfied   with   the   product   it   looks   wonderful   and   works   great   as   well .   the   price   was   less   than   the   one   we   saw   in   the   store   and   the   delivery   time   was   faster   than   what   the   computer   stated .   i   had   it   install   the   same   day   and   i   am   very   happy   about   this   product   and   the   overall   purchase .   i   know   you   will   too .
cheap   and   poor   quality   do   not   buy   when   i   opened   the   box ,   i   saw   the   corner   next   to   the   push   button   was   lose .   the   thin   and   cheap   stainless   steel   is   only   on   the   front ,   everything   else   is   either   painted   metal   and   plastic .   i   can   t   believe   that   the   seller   abes   of   maine   cameras   and   electronics   did   not   check   the   product   before   ship   to   the   customer
junk   dont   buy   frigidaire .   i   bought   a   set   of   appliances   this   being   one   of   them   and   the   only   one   i   havent   had   issues   with   is   the   stove   so   far .   haven   t   even   had   the   stuff   a   full   year .
great   inexpensive   otr   microwave   the   first   time   i   used   it ,   i   was   disappointed   with   it ,   but   i   don   t   know   if   it   just   got   better ,   or   if   i   pushed   the   wrong   button   the   first   time   because   it   s   been   great   since .   nice   and   roomy   interior ,   easy   to   install   i   did   it   completely   by   myself ,   though   i   recommend   you   have   a   friend   .   i   did   forget   to   change   the   fan   so   that   it   vented   up   at   first ,   so   i   had   to   take   it   down   to   do   that ,   but   once   you   get   the   frame   mounted   on   the   wall ,   that   part   is   easy .   the   hardest   part   was   mounting   it   to   the   cabinet   above ...   i   m   not   sure   how   they   could   have   made   it   any   easier   though ,   the   problem   is   mostly   a   matter   of   physics .   i   would   recommend   this   to   anyone   needing   a   decent   power   microwave   to   go   over   their   range .
general   electric   microwave   display   does   not   show   up .   it   works   fine   otherwise .   this   general   electric   microwave   works   fine   as   far   as   cooking   things   or   heating   up   water   but   my   menu   display   has   never   worked .   i   can   see   the   menu   on   the   machine   but   what   the   microwave   is   actually   doing   does   not   show   up .   it   is   a   low   powered   microwave   so   it   takes   a   while   to   cook   with   it .   i   use   it   daily   for   cooking   food   and   heating   up   water   for   tea   or   soup .   underneath   the   rotating   plate   rusted   as   water   from   boiling   water   dripped   down   onto   the   inside   of   the   microwave .   so   the   plastic   or   polymer   covering   came   off   the   bottom   but   it   works   fine   still   spins   around   as   it   works .   the   light   comes   on   when   i   open   the   door   more   than   a   year   and   a   half   later   since   i   got   it .   it   does   not   take   up   much   space .
poor   quality   after   1   year   of   light   use   maybe   3x   per   week   to   warm   leftovers   ,   the   sensor   stopped   working   and   now   the   microwave   does   not   heat   anything .   the   cost   to   repair   is   more   than   the   appliance   is   worth .
direct   replacement   for   the   jem31   like   and   earlier   reviewer   i   was   looking   for   a   replacement   for   a   5   year   old   cabinet   installed   jem31   but   could   not   find   information   about   its   compatibility .   i   can   t   comment   about   the   reliability   but   it   s   a   drop   in   replacement .   i   used   all   the   same   hardware   including   the   faceplate   from   the   old   microwave .   as   a   bonus   the   unit   seems   a   little   more   advanced   also .   this   unit   is   installed   in   a   12   inch   cabinet   which   is   a   rare   installation   and   i   m   grateful   it   s   still   available .
cheap   and   cheesy   we   bought   this   to   replace   our   ge   that   died   after   several   services .   turned   out   to   be   very   cheesy   and   after   the   warranty   ran   out   the   door   handle   cracked   and   then   finally   broke   off .   we   will   be   replacing   this   with   a   ge   which   we   should   ve   done   from   the   get   go .   this   was   a   low   price   microwave   but   as   the   old   saying   goes ... you   get   what   you   pay   for   .   some   items   can   t   be   skimped   on .
handle   and   front   broke   off   in   a   few   months   of   owning ,   used   by   only   adult   couple   i   would   never   recommend   this   microwave   to   anyone .   within   only   a   few   months   of   owning ,   the   handle   broke   off ,   and   the   front   plastic   cracked .   of   course   my   husband   lost   the   receipt ,   so   we   could   not   return   it ,   so   we   ve   dealt   with   it   with   no   handle   for   a   year .   now   the   whole   front   plastic   has   broken   off   and   the   glass   fell   out   so   we   can   t   use   it   any   more .   why   would   lg   continue   to   make   such   a   poorly   constructed   product   the   plastic   is   brittle   and   the   construction   is   bad .   i   would   say   this   microwave   does   not   even   heat   food   as   well   as   some   of   my   past   cheap   counter   top   models .   if   i   could   give   this   product   0   stars ,   i   would .   please   do   yourself   a   favor   and   do   not   buy   this   product .   we   will   never   buy   lg   again .
it   s   fine   three   years   later !   i   have   had   this   microwave   three   years .   the   only   problem   i   ever   have   with   it   is   that   the   door   sticks   sometimes .   i   just   have   to   tug   on   it   every   once   in   a   while .   the   oven   works   consistently   and   does   everything   it   should .   the   defrost   stops   intermittently   to   tell   you   to   turn   things   over   or   separate   them   or   whatever .   that   is   sometimes   helpful   and   sometimes   not   if   i   have   just   one   chicken   breast   in   there   to   defrost   i   have   to   hit   the   button   to   resume   defrost   about   three   or   four   times .   i   do   respond   by   turning   the   chicken   over   one   of   those   times .   i   defintely   recommend   the   microwave .
junk ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !   i   bought   my   microwave   directly   from   whirlpool   in   march   2011 .   in   july   2011   it   died .   the   first   repair   man   came   out   a   week   later .   he   order   parts   waited   another   week   ,   second   repair   man   came   out   to   put   in   the   new   part .   he   said   it   was   fried   could   not   be   fix .   well   whirlpool   is   supposed   to   be   replacing   the   microwave .   it   s   4   week   later   close   to   5   weeks   still   no   microwave .   the   service   department   is   awful .
mostly   pros   and   a   couple   of   cons ...   i   purchased   this   microwave   in   october   2008   2   years   and   10   months   ago   after   a   disastrous   experience   with   a   ge   spacemaker .   if   i   could   give   half   stars ,   i   would   give   the   lg   a   4.5   at   this   point .   it   was   very   reasonably   priced   compared   to   others   with   similar   features ,   and   reasonably   easy   to   install .   it   does   a   good   job   overall ,   has   some   features   that   the   spacemaker   did   not   have ,   but   also   lacks   some   nice   features   that   the   much   more   expensive   spacemaker   had .   here   s   what   i   really   like   about   the   lg   1 .   multiple   speed   exhaust   fan   with   timer .   2 .   more   time   less   time   buttons .   3 .   soften   melt   defrost   settings   work   well .   4 .   turntable   on   off   setting   is   useful   for   large   or   oblong   cooking   vessels .   5 .   popcorn ,   hot   dog   settings   are   very   accurate .   6 .   hold   warm   feature   keeps   cooked   items   at   a   safe   temp   for   up   to   90   minutes .   7 .   it   doesn   t   need   the   clock   set   just   to   use   the   microwave ,   like   the   spacemaker   did .   8 .   it   works   reliably   every   time   i   use   it !   here   s   what   i   feel   the   lg   lacks   1 .   doesn   t   remind   you   after   cooking   is   finished   the   spacemaker   beeped   discreetly   every   30   seconds   for   up   to   an   hour   .   2 .   reheat   settings   are   sometimes   a   bit   too   aggressive .   3 .   can   t   adjust   the   volume   of   the   beeps   when   setting   or   finishing   cooking   default   volume   is   a   bit   loud   .   4 .   aesthetically ,   the   black   window   on   the   front   is   not   as   attractive   as   the   spacemaker   s   white   window .   5 .   although   the   ez   on   button   starts   and   adds   30   second   increments ,   a   quick   minute   button   would   be   useful .   6 .   the   turntable   is   smaller   than   it   could   be   although   this   has   not   really   presented   any   problems   .   7 .   the   spacemaker   had   an   automatic   nightlight   feature ,   the   lg   does   not   this   is   a   small   inconvenience   .   at   this   point   in   its   lifetime ,   i   would   recommend   this   microwave .   if   that   changes ,   i   ll   update   this   review   accordingly .
great   addition   to   our   kitchen   the   ge   profile   countertop   microwave   2.2   cu . ft .   is   not   only   a   sleek   looking   appliance   on   our   counter   but   is   easy   to   use   and   allows   for   large   capacity   food   items .   very   satisfied   with   our   purchase .
pure   crap ! ! !   this   microwave   was   very   hard   to   install ,   and   i   am   pretty   handy .   within   a   month   the   numbers   stopped   lighting   up   and   some   of   the   touch   buttons   such   as   defrost   button   stopped   working .   within   another   month   the   push   button   door   latch   stopped   functioning   and   we   had   to   take   it   off ,   now   we   have   to   use   a   screwdriver   to   pop   the   door   open .   the   stainless   steel   started   to   turn   brownish   and   doesn   t   come   off .   recently   the   lights   started   turning   on   by   themselves   and   today   was   the   last   straw   when   the   fan   came   on   by   itself   and   wouldn   t   turn   off .   that   is   why   i   am   on   here   looking   for   a   new   one .   save   yourself   a   major   headache   and   don   t   buy   it ! !
good   microwave ,   loud   fan   this   microwave   came   with   our   new   home .   it   can   be   vented   outside   or   inside   ours   is   vented   inside   and   there   is   always   grime   on   cupboards   above   our   range   where   the   outlet   is ,   and   we   really   don   t   fry   that   much .   so   plan   to   vent   this   outside   or   do   a   lot   of   scrubbing .   the   fan   is   very   loud ,   so   if   you   like   to   have   a   conversation   anywhere   in   the   house   while   cooking ,   this   may   not   be   the   product   for   you .   again ,   this   might   be   better   if   vented   outside .   microwave   itself   works   good ,   defrost   function   is   handy .
looks   great   but   lives   up   to   poor   reviews   i   knew   this   microwave   had   poor   reviews   even   before   i   purchased   it ,   but   it   was   literally   the   only   microwave   i   could   find   that   would   fit   properly   in   an   upper   cabinet   and   not   stick   out .   so   on   that   score ,   it   does   really   well   this   really   is   a   great   looking   microwave   that   fits   in   an   upper   cabinet   and   looks   custom .   unfortunately ,   one   month   after   i   purchased   it ,   the   trim   on   the   right   side   of   the   microwave   around   the   door   button   started   falling   off   and   it   was   easy   to   see   why   as   it   was   attached   only   with   two   sided   tape .   i   called   up   mabe   canada   customer   support   and   after   describing   the   problem   and   faxing   in   my   receipt ,   they   shipped   a   replacement   microwave   straight   to   my   door   within   3   business   days .   i   wish   there   was   an   alternative   to   this   microwave ,   but   i   m   stuck   with   it   for   now ,   and   i   have   to   admit   the   customer   service   was   fantastic .   hopefully   my   replacement   will   hold   up .
don   t   buy   this   piece   of   junk   i   was   laughing   when   i   read   the   reviews ,   the   same   exact   thing   happen   to   us ,   we   just   bought   a   new   condo   and   the   microwave   came   with   it .   i   started   thinking   that   may   be   the   house   was   haunted   or   something .   the   control   panel   stopped   working   and   the   microwave   start   by   itself   and   stop   by   itself .   stay   away   from   this   microwave   you   ll   waste   your   money .
do   not   buy   this   piece   of   junk   microwave   my   1st   unit   fried   and   was   unuasable .   it   was   replaced   after   a   few   customer   service   calls   and   a   service   tech   visit .   the   replacement   unit   makes   a   big   noise   and   the   vent   fan   is   so   loud   that   the   entire   sub   division   could   hear   our   microwave .   i   have   gone   through   several   calls   to   their   customer   service   and   two   service   visits   later   the   issue   is   still   not   fixed .   do   not   buy   this   unit .   it   wasn   t   my   choice .. i   got   it   from   the   new   home   i   purchased   and   i   am   sure   it   s   not   going   to   last   even   3   months .
only   worked   for   a   few   days   danby   model   dmw111kbldb   will   heat   for   less   than   a   minute   then   shows   an   error   code   and   stops .   bottom   of   right   side   gets   very   hot .   brand   new ,   returning   it   for   sure .   perhaps   another   brand   will   do   better .   danby   promotes   themselves   as   one   of   the   largest   household   appliance   marketing   companies   in   north   america .   aren   t   they   the   manufacturer   of   this   product  
third   one   in   2   months   and   still   don   t   have   a   good   one ... waiting   for   parts   what   i   like   about   the   whirlpool   kitchen   aid   microwaves   is   they   offer   models   with   accuwave   cooking .   when   you   cook   at   50   power ,   it   cooks   at   50   power   rather   than   cycling   on   and   off   at   100   power ,   for   50   of   the   time .   this   makes   a   massive   difference   on   how   things   cook .   we   previously   had   a   gh5184xps   with   accuwave   that   lasted   4   years   before   it   stopped   cooking .   it   was   starting   to   not   look   so   nice   from   normal   use ,   so   i   decided   to   go   with   a   new   one   instead   of   repairing   the   old   one .   after   the   new   microwave   was   installed ,   i   tried   a   cup   of   water   in   it .   when   i   started   it ,   it   sounded   like   an   arc   welder ,   and   when   i   looked   at   the   plastic   panel   on   the   right   side   where   the   magnetron   is ,   it   looked   like   an   arc   torch   flame .   i   quickly   turned   it   off   so   it   wouldn   t   burn   the   place   down .   they   took   it   back   and   gave   me   another .   the   very   night   we   got   it ,   we   were   making   popcorn   in   the   special   microwave   popcorn   bowl ,   which   we   had   used   for   years   with   our   other   microwaves .   within   a   minute ,   we   got   an   f7   call   for   service   code .   they   offered   to   exchange   it   for   a   new   one ,   but   didn   t   have   another ,   but   told   me   they   could   sell   me   the   new   5184 ,   and   updated   model   of   our   old   one .   i   noticed   that   the   new   one   had   a   broiler ,   slightly   different   menus ,   50   cheaper ,   and   we   had   good   luck   with   our   previous   5184 .   however ,   after   it   was   installed ,   the   cook   said ,   this   doesn   t   cook   right .   i   checked   it   out .   the   updated   5184   no   longer   has   accuwave .   that   isn   t   how   it   was   represented ,   so   i   gave   them   their   50   back   and   had   them   order   another   one   of   these   from   the   factory .   that   went   along   for   3   days   before   we   noticed   that   part   way   through   the   cooking   time ,   the   magnetron   noise   would   stop ,   the   fan   speed   up ,   the   light   got   brighter ,   and   the   food   stopped   cooking .   since   the   chicken   was   still   pink ,   i   added   2   minutes   at   full   power ,   and   immediately   received   an   f7   code .   the   problem   actually   started   when   it   stopped   cooking   during   the   previous   operation .   you   don   t   get   the   f7   until   you   try   to   start   it   again , and   the   magnetron   doesn   t   start .   we   couldn   t   trust   it   with   chicken .   we   avoided   certain   foods   and   alternated   between   manual   and   automatic   cycles   to   get   around   the   f7   codes .   as   time   progressed ,   we   could   do   less   and   less .   now ,   you   can   t   even   trust   it   to   finish   a   bowl   of   oatmeal .   that   was   enough   for   me .   there   is   no   possibility   of   buying   a   good   one   from   the   factory ,   so   there   is   no   point   in   getting   another   new   one .   thus ,   i   decided   i   would   use   warranty   service   to   see   if   they   can   put   in   good   parts   that   will   work .   the   dealer   recommended   warranty   repair   source   wouldn   t   take   the   job   when   he   learned   which   model   it   was .   whirlpool   got   another   company   to   come   the   following   morning .   they   put   a   large   bowl   of   water   in   the   microwave   to   test   it ,   and   could   find   nothing   wrong .   they   said   their   manual   doesn   t   even   list   an   f7   code .   there   is   nothing   easier   on   a   microwave   than   a   large   bowl   of   water .   i   went   on   the   internet   and   printed   off   one   of   a   myriad   of   postings   about   f7   for   this   microwave   model ,   with   detail   instructions   on   how   to   troubleshoot .   then   i   put   real   food   in   the   microwave   and   showed   them   how   easy   it   is   to   get   an   f7 .   included   in   the   troubleshooting   instructions   were   comments   from   the   techs   that   service   these   every   day   who   state   that   they   always   go   through   the   procedure   to   eliminate   any   other   causes ,   but   it   always   ends   up   being   the   expensive   microprocessor   board .   the   on   site   techs   did   not   follow   the   checklist ,   and   called   the   factory .   the   factory   told   them   they   will   send   them   a   switch   to   try .   i   was   hoping   it   would   be   the   thermal   switch ,   but   the   techs   indicated   it   was   not .   the   on   site   techs   reminded   the   factory   that   the   problem   starts   mid   cycle .   the   factory   came   back   with ,   as   it   gets   hotter ,   the   switch   contacts   may   be   increasing   resistance ,   causing   the   problem .   i   could   repeat   the   f7   at   will .   they   did   not   check   the   switch   for   high   resistance   nor   follow   the   factory   procedure   to   troubleshoot   the   f7   error .   next   wednesday ,   the   switch   is   scheduled   to   be   delivered ,   and   the   techs   will   be   returning   to   put   it   in .   the   service   company   also   had   little   confidence   in   the   factory   s   recommendation ,   but   they   have   to   do   what   the   factory   says .   perhaps   the   fist   service   company   has   gone   through   this   before   and   may   be   why   they   wouldn   t   take   the   job   for   this   model .   i   ve   been   through   3   of   this   model ,   and   4   installs ,   since   april   5   2011 ,   and   i   don   t   have   a   good   microwave   yet .   they   ve   eaten   up   more   of   my   time   than   the   microwave   is   worth .   now   it   s   my   turn .   i   will   make   it   my   personal   mission   to   require   them   to   keep   sending   technicians   to   my   house   to   fix   this   model   until   it   works   as   advertised ,   on   real   food ,   or   supply   me   with   a   model   of   equal   to   or   greater   value ,   that   works   as   advertised ,   for   free ,   and   with   a   new   warranty .
mixed   feelings   update   br   after   16   months   we   have   the   same   problem   as   others .   it   runs   for   3   or   4   seconds   and   just   shuts   off .   br   br   original   review   br   i   have   only   owned   the   microwave   for   a   short   time   so   i   can   not   rate   the   reliability ,   not   that   my   individual   experience   would   necessarily   be   typical .   however ,   i   can   rate   the   features   and   design   of   the   unit .   i   like   the   size ,   the   power   and   the   large   turntable .   the   controls ,   however ,   were   poorly   designed .   for   example ,   to   cook   at   anything   other   than   full   power ,   you   need   to   press   the   power   level   repeatedly .   the   first   press   of   the   button   gives   you   100   power   and   each   subsequent   press   reduces   the   power   level   by   10   .   so ,   to   cook   something   at   30   power   it   takes   eight   presses   of   the   button .
the   good   and   the   bad   videoid   mo1lohj4vrrgajt   the   good   my   brand   new ,   out   of   the   box   spacesaver   is   great   looking ,   it   is   cabinet   depth   so   it   doesn   t   stick   out ,   it   fits   perfectly   under   a   cabinet   with   the   kit   and ,   when   you   can   get   the   door   open ,   it   works   really   well .   i   just   completely   redid   my   kitchen   and   it   looks   marvelous .   the   bad   the   door   doesn   t   open .   seriously   doesn   t   open .   ok ,   i   m   exaggerating .   if   you   really ,   really   try ,   you   can   eventually   get   the   door   open .   from   day   one   it   didn   t   open .   see   the   video   demo   of   my   trying   to   open   the   door .   the   better   my   wonderful   local   appliance   dealer   who   sold   it   to   me   is   not   going   to   try   to   fix   it .   they   are   sending   me   a   new   one   and   taking   this   one   back .   there   are   some   benefits   to   paying   a   bit   more   and   buying   local .   i   ll   update   this   review   when   i   get   the   new   one .   i   m   really   hoping   i   get   a   good   one   like   a   subset   of   the   microwaves   all   of   you   have .   however ,   you   should   not   have   to   wish   to   be   a   subset   when   you   are   paying   over   250   for   a   microwave .   they   should   all   be   good ,   quality   microwaves .   there   are   so   few   under   cabinet ,   cabinet   depth ,   models   available ,   we   are   sort   of   stuck   with   the   ge   spacesaver .   july   23 ,   2011   update   to   my   review   on   this   microwave .   my   appliance   dealer   send   me   a   new   one   and   it   works   just   fine .   i   ve   only   had   it   about   a   month ,   so   i   don   t   know   how   it   will   last ,   but   as   of   right   now ,   it   is   functioning   perfectly .
terrible !   unreliable   and   now   is   dead !   this   machine   s   finish   quality   was   off   out   of   the   box .   the   door   didn   t   quite   line   up   with   it   s   case   when   closed   and   there   were   a   couple   small   dents   on   the   lower   left   of   the   door   as   well .   these   were   tolerable ,   however ,   as   long   as   the   machine   worked   and   it   did ...   sometimes .   for   example ,   from   the   start   this   machine   would   occasionally   shut   off   mid   cooking ,   as   in   the   timer   would   go   blank ,   the   light   would   go   out ,   and   the   food   would   still   be   pretty   cold .   other   times   the   food   would   seem   to   be   heating   up   pretty   well   but   then   the   machine   would   shut   off .   on   those   occasions   we   thought   it   might   have   quit   because   it   was   getting   too   much   steam   on   its   sensors   wherever   they   might   have   been   so   we   would   wrap   foods   extremely   tightly   with   plastic   wrap   still   to   no   avail .   on   still   other   occasions   the   food   looked   like   it   was   being   cooked   light   stayed   on ,   the   table   rotated ,   the   timer   counted   down ,   and   tone   sounded   at   the   end   but   then   it   would   turn   out   to   be   only   ever   so   slightly   warmer   than   when   originally   put   in .   after   a   year   of   our   just   making   do   with   this   machine   s   cranky   behavior   and   then   just   planning   our   meals   without   microwave   use   it   died   altogether .   my   wife   and   i   can   only   say ,   good   riddance !   in   response .   consumer   reports   lists   this   microwave   as   a   best   buy   and ,   honestly ,   that   s   why   i   bought   it   in   the   first   place .   unfortunately ,   this   machine   is   far ,   far ,   far   from   being   a   good   buy   much   less   a   best   buy ! ! !   based   on   my   experience   and   those   of   the   others   who   wrote   in   here   i   won   t   be   touching   a   ge   microwave   for   years ,   if   then .
adequate   small   microwave   we   purchased   ours   about   6   months   ago   and   we   find   it   to   work   as   about   as   well   as   we   assumed   it   would   given   it   s   low   power   and   lower   price .   expect   longer   heating   times   than   a   larger   microwave   oven .   if   you   are   an   impatient   person   you   may   want   to   pass   on   this   model .   the   hot   water   presets   work   fine   for   reheating   coffee .   our   one   real   complaint   is   that   the   turntable   is   all   too   easily   dislodged   from   the   spindle   if   a   heavy   item   is   not   carefully   placed   near   the   center   of   the   surface .   we   find   this   design   defect   really   annoying   and   would   not   choose   this   model   again   for   this   reason   alone .
very   disapointed   i   have   been   shipped   two   of   these   microwaves   and   they   were   both   doa .   different   issues .   sharp   might   consider   testing   them   before   they   leave   the   factory .   i   won   t   purchase   another   sharp   microwave .   the   customer   service   was   slow   and   did   nothing   to   help   me .   i   could   haul   it   to   a   local   service   center   and   they   said   that   the   tech   might   be   able   to   fix   it   while   i   waited   but   i   ve   been   to   enough   service   centers   to   know   that   this   is   not   likely .   i   m   not   happy   at   all .
microwave   paint   fix   that   works   my   daughter   had   a   ge   microwave   oven   combo .   the   microwave   had   the   infamous   ge   flaking   paint   interior   problem .   the   cost   of   replacing   the   integrated   units   to   correct   the   microwave   was   very   steep .   so   i   bought   a   can   of   this   paint   to   see   if   it   would   work .   br   br   to   my   amazement ,   it   did !   now   it   wasn   t   easy ,   i   had   to   degrease   the   inside   of   the   oven   tsp   ,   then   sand   it   by   hand   and   some   machine   for   about   an   hour   to   get   all   the   base   paint   solid .   i   used   paintstriper   sanding   blocks ,   60   and   100   grit ,   the   followed   up   with   some   150   grit   paper .   then   i   had   to   mask   the   oven   opening   with   masking   tape ,   paper ,   and   a   cheap   plastic   tarp   to   beware   of   overspray .   br   br   pro   followed   the   directions   on   the   can ,   and   sprayed   away !   it   worked   and   is   still   holding   up   3   weeks   later .   so   about   35   in   material   has ,   so   far ,   stopped   a   very   expensive   hundreds   of   dollars   oven   replacement .   br   br   cons   the   paint   is   acetone   based   so   ventilation   is   a   must   .   pick   a   day   when   doors   and   windows   can   be   open   and   i   would   get   the   kids   out   of   the   house .   the   paint   does   dry   very   fast   in   about   an   hour .
great   product ! ! ! !   great   product .   fits   perfectly   in   the   space   we   have   for   it   and   works   like   a   charm .   sleek   and   effective !
stopped   working   after   2   months   the   microwave   looks   good ,   but   stopped   heating   after   2   months .   i   am   on   hold   now   with   sharp   customer   service .   the   space   saving   design   is   nice ,   but   don   t   like   waiting   for   the   drawer   to   open   close .   the   controls   being   4   off   the   ground   are   tempting   for   my   3yr   old .
outstanding !   this   microwave   is   incredible !   very   quiet   and   the   convenience   of   a   drawer   is   great !   easy   to   use   and   to   clean !
outstanding !   my   sharp   drawer   microwave   is   so   much   more   than   i   even   hoped   for .   it   is   convenient .   the   button   to   open   and   button   to   close   or   easy   pull   to   open   or   easy   nudge   to   close   and   it   finishes   opening   or   closing   by   itself !   love   that !   i   had   to   reprogram   myself   to   go   easy   to   get   it   opening   or   closing ,   then   let   it   finish   all   by   itself .   i   was   impatient   because   it   takes   2   seconds   rather   than   1   2   second   that   i   used   on   my   previous   microwave   to   jerk   it   open   or   slam   it   shut .   it   s   good   for   me   to   slow   down   for   2   seconds !   there   are   more   single   cook   options   than   i   have   used   yet .   i   really   like   the   push   start   once   to   get   one   minute   cook   time ,   2   pushes   for   2   minutes ,   etc .   can   do   the   same   to   add   a   minute   while   cooking .   sensor   reheat   and   sensor   cook   buttons   are   useful ,   but   as   in   prior   microwaves ,   i   have   to   still   keep   a   check   on   how   it   s   cooking .   it   seems   to   cook   evenly ,   but   i   probably   will   get   a   windup   turntable   if   i   can   still   find   one .   it   holds   a   9x13   pan   with   room   to   spare .   the   1000w   power   cooks   fast .   love   it !   love   it !   love   it !
perfect   for   my   needs   i   wanted   a   microwave   that   took   up   as   little   counter   space   as   possible ,   had   sensor   cooking   and   was   easy   to   use .   this   one   fit   all   that   criteria   and   had   a   bonus   a   beverage   key   which   i   use   a   lot   to   heat   water   to   the   perfect   temp   for   tea .   this   microwave   is   perfect   for   my   needs   and   i   m   very   happy   with   it .   the   only   downside   is   that   the   quality   is   only   average .
small   and   underpowered ...   the   box   was   somehow   very   light ,   and   right   then ,   i   knew   we   had   made   a   mistake .   this   microwave   is   almost   like   a   toy .   it   is   very   tiny   and   underpowered .   we   unpacked   it   and   put   in   a   pack   of   popcorn .   well ,   it   spun   around   on   top   strength   for   over   two   minutes   without   a   single   pop .   after   3   4   minutes   about   half   of   the   popcorn   was   popped .   forget   it .   it   must   have   been   broken ,   or   maybe   just   for   making   things   warm ,   not   hot .   we   returned   it   right   away .   speedy   return   system !
no .   the   incessant   beeping   is   enough   to   make   you   want   to   put   your   own   head   inside   the   microwave .   next   to   that ,   when   you   select   a   defrost   time ,   it   literally   stops   every   30   seconds   to   tell   you   to   turn   it   over .   and   wont   start   ubnless   you   open   and   close   the   door   then   push   start   again   i   hate   this   thing .   good   thing   it   looks   nice   because   the   features ,   the   beeping ,   and   the   ui   is   absolutely   unnerving .   i   am   writing   this   as   some   steaks   are   defrosting   in   it   and   the   constant   stops   and   beeping   has   just   finally   gotten   me   to   the   point   where   i   had   to   come   here   and   whine   about   it .
velos   is   a   dud   i   purchased   this   produce   when   it   first   came   it   and   loved   the   look   of   the   unit .   within   a   year   the   interior   paint   has   peeled   off   on   the   inside   of   the   door   and   the   inside   of   teflon   coating   of   the   unit .   the   stainless   still   overs   have   been   glued   back   on   3   times   now   and   just   recently   the   door   handle   broke .   i   never   leave   review   because   honestly   i   am   too   lazy   but   i   just   had   to   warn   buyers   of   this   product .   i   have   contacted   whirlpool   twice   and   they   told   me   that   the   paint   was   cosmetic   and   is   only   covered   under   the   30   day   warranty .   really   paint   is   supposed   to   chip   within   30   days   then   the   other   parts   are   also   cosmetic   but   they   can   get   an   technician   to   come   out   at   my   cost   of   course .   lastly ,   despite   all   the   bad   reviews ,   the   have   determined   this   product   has   no   quality   issues .   i   will   never   buy   a   whirlpool   product   again .
great   cusomer   service   this   unit   is   a   replacement   for   an   identical   item   that   arrived   with   concealed   damage .   i   notifed   amazon   around   3pm   the   day   it   arrived   and   received   word   that   a   replacement   unit   had   been   ordered   and   it   would   take   several   days   to   process   the   order .   two   hours   later ,   i   received   notification   that   the   replacement   unit   had   been   shipped !   it   arrived   at   9   15   the   next   morning !   outstanding   customer   service   effort   by   amazon .   this   microwave   replaced   a   2002   sharp   model   identical   in   size ,   power   and   other   features .   the   first   thing   i   noticed   is   that   it   takes   30   to   40   longer   to   heat   compared   to   the   older   model ,   even   after   8   years   of   use .   this   is   across   the   board ,   not   just   on   certain   items .   also ,   the   keypad   has   been   reconfigured   with   the   start   and   stop   buttons   situated   in   between   rows   of   other   buttons   instead   of   separated   from   other   buttons   as   on   the   older   model .   the   buttons   are   also   smaller   and   it   is   easy   to   push   the   wrong   button   if   you   get   in   a   hurry .   i   will   say   it   is   a   more   attractive   unit   and   a   lot   quieter   than   the   older   model .
peeling   paint   on   ge   space   saver   microwave   i   have   made   the   mistake   of   buying   two   ge   space   saver   microwaves   for   my   two   homes .   both   have   badly   peeling   paint   not   only   inside   the   door   but   on   the   back   wall   of   the   microwave   as   well .   got   same   answer   form   ge . buy   the   paint   and   paint   it   myself .   did   buy   the   paint   but   by   then   the   rust   was   too   extensive   to   nake   it   work .   i   am   also   looking   for   a   nice   microwave   about   the   same   size   and   features !
some   unique   features ,   falling   apart   i   bought   this   because   i   don   t   have   a   double   oven   in   my   kitchen   and   this   can   serve   that   purpose .   if   you   have   a   double   oven ,   then   i   think   you   are   better   off   with   a   standard   high   quality   microwave .   this   is   a   high   speed   microwave   convection   oven   but   due   to   the   size   of   the   cavity   the   conv   oven   takes   longer   to   heat   up .   about   10   minutes   to   reach   350 .   once   preheated   convection   works   good .   does   a   nice   job   with   frozen   pizza ,   rib   roast ,   chicken ,   etc .   this   makes   really   good   toast   in   6   minutes ,   3   minutes   per   side ,   you   have   to   flip   the   bread .   but   i   don   t   think   it   saves   any   time .   also ,   when   you   use   the   convection   oven ,   remember   it   has   to   cool   down   to   use   it   again   as   a   microwave .   that   can   take   another   10   15   minutes .   bought   mine   about   4   yrs   ago   with   a   5yr   extended   warranty .   within   the   last   month ,   a   piece   of   plastic   trim   fell   off ,   door   handle   cracked ,   and   the   touch   screen   started   randomly   simulating   keypresses .   repair   service   came   out   3x   to   get   the   right   parts   ordered   and   repaired ,   maybe   it   s   fixed .   will   find   out .   cooks   well .   the   best   feature   is   that   this   is   a   variable   microwave   unlike   most   units   that   simply   turn   the   magnetron   on   and   off   to   vary   the   power   ,   this   one   actually   reduces   the   power   itself ...   very   cool .   this   also   combines   microwave   with   convection   bake   and   grill   capabilities ,   and   you   can   control   the   bake   temp   as   well   as   the   of   microwave   to   use .   for   grilling   you   control   the   microwave   but   not   the   grill   temp ,   as   the   grill   halogen   just   stays   on   the   whole   time .   that   isactually   a   very   nice   feature .   on   my   regular   oven ,   the   broiler   turns   off   at   500 .   so   from   that   standpoint   the   unit   is   pretty   smart .   get   this   on   a   firesale   if   you   can ...   get   a   long   term   5yr   extended   warranty ,   you   will   use   it .   as   other   s   point   out ,   it   doesn   t   have   program   cooking ,   can   t   do   a   delayed   start ,   can   t   do   multiple   programs   in   sequence ,   doesn   t   have   a   meat   thermometer ,   but   it   does   have   a   lot   of   pre   sets .   so ,   it   s   an   ok   unit   i   haven   t   really   found   anything   that   competes   with   it .   would   be   interested   in   hearing   feedback   on   better   choices .
surprisingly   versatile   little   microwave ...   as   a   vertically   challenged   individual ,   i   was   looking   forward   to   getting   a   countertop   microwave   when   we   remodelled   our   kitchen .   however ,   i   was   not   looking   forward   to   giving   up   the   multiple   functions   offered   by   my   larger ,   over   the   stove   microwave .   additionally ,   i   did   not   want   to   give   up   my   useable   counter   space   which   i   would   have   to   do   with   the   standard   18   inch   or   more   deep   countertop   microwaves .   i   also   wanted   enough   space   left   on   the   counter   so   that ,   if   necessary ,   when   removing   something   from   the   microwave ,   i   could   sit   the   container   on   the   counter   immediately   in   front   of   the   microwave .   i   had   a   small   24   inch   wide   by   14   inch   deep   nook   available   between   my   refrigerator   and   the   corner   appliance   garage ,   but   was   certain   i   would   not   find   a   suitable   microwave   to   fit .   since   we   were   not   replacing   cabinets ,   i   had   to   work   with   the   available   spaces .   br   br   to   my   surprise ,   the   ge   profile   spacemaker   ii   was   the   exact   size   of   the   nook !   although   there   were   many   negative   reviews   of   the   product ,   i   decided   to   take   a   chance   on   this   microwave   and   purchased   one   at   best   buy .   through   an   abundance   of   caution ,   i   also   purchased   an   additional   4   year   warranty   so   that   if   i   experience   any   of   the   problems   others   have   encountered ,   i   will   be   able   to   have   the   spacemaker   ii   repaired   or   replaced .   as   the   extended   warranty   was   only   a   little   more   than   a   service   call   would   cost ,   i   felt   it   was   worth   the   expenditure .   br   br   so   far ,   i   am   very   pleased   with   the   ge   profile   spacemaker   ii   microwave .   my   spouse   and   i   do   not   cook   meals   in   our   microwave ,   but   do   reheat   beverages   cook   frozen   vegetables   and   veggie   burgers   and ,   occasionally ,   defrost   meat .   the   spacemaker   performs   these   functions   admirably !   although   it   takes   about   30   more   time   to   heat   cook   things   than   my   1100   watt   microwave ,   this   has   not   been   a   problem .   further ,   i   like   this   model   better   for   defrosting   as   it   does   not   start   cooking   the   meat   like   the   more   powerful   models   do .   the   control   panel   buttons   are   very   responsive .   i   have   cracked   other   microwave   s   button   surfaces   because   of   the   difficulty   in   getting   them   to   respond   to   my   touch .   i   do   not   foresee   this   occuring   with   the   spacemaker   ii .   br   br   in   the   past ,   i   have   allowed   bread   to   raise   inside   my   microwave .   i   found   this   allowed   me   to   leave   the   bowl   or   pan   uncovered   as   there   is   no   air   flow   inside   the   microwave ,   and   the   temperature   remains   consistent .   the   spacemaker   s   interior   is   large   enough   for   me   to   continue   using   the   microwave   in   which   to   raise   bread .   br   br   because   i   keep   this   microwave   on   my   counter ,   i   keep   a   plastic   glass   of   water   in   it   to   prevent   accidentally   starting   it   empty   and   possibly   ruining   the   magnatron .   br   br   further ,   i   would   caution   those   who   are   looking   for   a   compact   microwave   for   an   elderly   individual   who   may   be   confused   by   having   to   choose   among   multiple   function   buttons .   the   ge   profile   spacemaker   ii   has   a   control   panel   that   can   be   confusing   as   it   has   29   separate   buttons   from   which   to   choose .   thus ,   it   might   not   be   the   best   choice   for   individuals .   br   br   for   me ,   the   ge   profile   spacemaker   ii   is   the   ideal   microwave   and   i   am   giving   it   a   five   star   rating .   if   things   change ,   i   will   update   my   review   accordingly . s   button   surfaces   because   of   the   difficulty   in   getting   them   to   respond   to   my   touch .   i   do   not   foresee   this   occuring   with   the   spacemaker   ii .   in   the   past ,   i   have   allowed   bread   to   raise   inside   my   microwave .   i   found   this   allowed   me   to   leave   the   bowl   or   pan   uncovered   as   there   is   no   air   flow   inside   the   microwave ,   and   the   temperature   remains   consistent .   the   spacemaker   s   interior   is   large   enough   for   me   to   continue   using   the   microwave   in   which   to   raise   bread .   because   i   keep   this   microwave   on   my   counter ,   i   keep   a   plastic   glass   of   water   in   it   to   prevent   accidentally   starting   it   empty   and   possibly   ruining   the   magnatron .   further ,   i   would   caution   those   who   are   looking   for   a   compact   microwave   for   an   elderly   individual   who   may   be   confused   by   having   to   choose   among   multiple   function   buttons .   the   ge   profile   spacemaker   ii   has   a   control   panel   that   can   be   confusing   as   it   has   29   separate   buttons   from   which   to   choose .   thus ,   it   might   not   be   the   best   choice   for   individuals .   for   me ,   the   ge   profile   spacemaker   ii   is   the   ideal   microwave   and   i   am   giving   it   a   five   star   rating .   if   things   change ,   i   will   update   my   review   accordingly .
broke   3   times   in   5   years   fridgidaire   over   the   range   fmv   156   dca   looks   nice   but   nothing   but   trouble .   first   the   handle   broke .   i   fixed   it .   then   the   diode   rectifire   failed   i   replaced   that   and   the   magnitron ,   worked   for   a   year   than   died   in   the   middle   of   cooking   a   baked   potatoe .   replaced   diode   still   not   working .   i   am   giving   up   and   never   buying   fridigaire   again .   btw   i   replaced   it   with   a   maytag   what   do   you   know ,   as   soon   as   i   tried   to   cook   some   popcorn   it   shut   off .   it   only   will   stay   on   for   10   seconds   or   so   before   shutting   off .   i   am   taking   it   back   and   am   wondering   how   much   bad   luck   can   one   have   or   is   this   all   a   conspiracy   to   keep   microwave   service   people   busy .
five   years   old   and   dead !   looks   good ,   and   had   all   the   features   we   wanted .   too   bad   it   melted   it   s   wiring   last   night .   costs   more   to   repair   than   to   simply   replace   with   newer   less   expensive   model .
would   never   purchase   anything   by   ge   again   we   purchased   a   new   house   which   led   us   to   purchase   a   new   microwave   and   refrigerator .   we   chose   ge   for   both .   after   six   months   the   ice   maker   stopped   working .   after   6   years ,   a   refrigerator   which   still   looks   brand   new ,   was   freezing   all   of   the   food   in   the   refrigerator   section .   next   came   the   refrigerator   section   not   cooling   at   all .   we   had   to   go   purchase   yet   another   refrigerator   as   we   couldn   t   deal   with   our   food   going   back   all   the   time   based   on   the   reliability   of   this   refrigerator .   moved   this   ge   refrigerator   down   the   basement   to   use   for   excess   drinks ,   etc .   during   the   holidays .   repair   man   just   left   after   telling   me   it   was   too   expensive   to   fix   and   he   would   not   guarantee   that   something   else   didn   t   go   wrong .   oh   yeah ,   forgot   to   mention ,   my   ge   microwave   broke   last   week   also .   after   reading   the   reviews   complaints   on   ge   appliances ,   i   will   never   ever   put   a   ge   appliance   in   my   house .   spread   the   word .....
this   microwave   is   not   durable !   i   bought   this   appliance   over   a   year   ago   and   since   then   have   been   having   a   lot   of   problems   with   the   door .   the   plastic   handle   cracked   a   few   months   after   use ,   and   this   was   repaired   by   their   service .   a   few   months   later ,   the   same   problem   occurred   again ,   but   this   time   created   a   tiny   crack   on   the   door   itself .   again   it   was   serviced   for   the   handle   alone .   just   after   the   1   year   warrantee   expired ,   the   handle   cracked   the   3rd   time ,   this   time   creating   a   much   bigger   fissure   on   the   door   so   that   it   now   cannot   be   opened .   while   the   machine   still   functions ,   the   design   of   the   door   is   so   poor   that   i   would   not   at   all   buy   another   microwave   from   lg   again .   in   all   the   houses   i   have   owned ,   this   is   the   first   time   i   have   any   problems   with   any   microwave . i   would   not   at   all   recommend   it .
stay   away !   this   microwave   was   great   while   it   worked ,   but   it   didn   t   work   near   long   enough .   i   expect   more   from   a   product   at   this   price   point ,   especially   one   that   consumer   reports   rated   very   highly .   unfortunately   i   ve   owned   this   microwave   for   approximately   18   months ,   only   to   a   have   the   magnatron   apparently   the   part   that   makes   it   heat   go   out .   i   ve   contacted   whirpool   on   3   occasions   and   have   not   been   very   happy   with   my   results .   first   they   agreed   to   pay   for   the   labor   and   not   the   part ,   then   they   agreed   to   pay   for   the   part   and   not   the   labor .   the   part   is   back   ordered   so   i   m   stuck   with   no   microwave   and   paying   for   something   that   judging   by   the   number   of   other   complaints   on   here   is   obviously   a   manufacturing   a   error .   i   would   advise   staying   far   away   from   this   product   and   this   company .
not   recommended   door   broke   near   the   handle   in   less   than   one   year .   had   the   door   replaced   under   warranty .   now   the   new   door   is   breaking   in   the   exact   same   fashion   in   less   than   a   year   but   now   it   s   out   of   warranty !   .   new   door   costs   over   100 .   serious   design   or   manufacturing   flaw .   i   can   t   recommend   this   microwave .   very   disappointed .
after   much   research   online ...   after   our   old   microwave   died   we   started   searching   the   market   online   and   in   stores .   i   purchased   consumer   reports   for   microwaves   and   then   searched   for   them   on   amazon   to   read   the   customer   reviews .   the   top   ten   rated   had   horrible   customer   reviews .   so   then   decided   to   search   from   the   bottom   of   the   list   up ,   and   this   is   when   i   found   our   next   microwave .   loud   was   the   only   beef   with   this   microwave .   now   in   our   house   loud   with   all   our   kids   is   nothing   compared   to   a   microwave .   basically   if   your   trying   to   sleep   near   by   this   microwave   then   maybe   it   would   seem   loud .   but   the   1200   watts   cooks   everything   super   fast ,   even   heat   with   the   turning   tray   is   awesome !   this   is   used   several   times   a   day   and   after   a   month   no   complaints !
piece   of   junk   i   had   this   microwave   gh7208xrs   slightly   over   one   year   ago .   today   the   digital   display   went   out .   it   is   going   to   cost   alot   of   repair   it .   i   definitely   would   not   recommend   anyone   buy   this   unit   unless   you   get   the   extended   warranty .
sharp   microwave   my   husband   i   were   looking   for   a   microwave   for   my   daughter   her   husband   for   a   christmas   gift .   this   is   the   same   brand   that   we   have   are   very   happy   w   it .   this   is   exactly   what   we   were   looking   for   so   happy   to   find   it   such   a   reasonable   price .   their   home   is   nearing   completion   they   are   so   excited   to   install   this   microwave   start   using   it .   our   daughter   said   that   she   just   loves   the   modern   look   knows   that   it   ll   look   wonderful   w   all   their   other   stainless   steal   appliances .
second   time   around   we   replaced   our   15   year   old   ge   profile   spacemaker   with   a   new   updated   geprofile   spacemaker   microwave   oven .   it   is   basically   the   same   one   with   big   subtle   improvements .   i   am   probably   the   only   one   who   used   the   old   microwave   with   all   of   its   bells   and   whistles .   i   am   amazed   at   how   updated   these   items   are   today .   forinstance   to   cook   fresh   vegetables   just   load   them   in   and   push   the   veggie   button .   somehow   it   senses   when   they   are   cooked   to   perfection   and   not   rubber .   i   cooked   a   perfect   scrambeled   egg   in   one   minute ,   stirring   once .   we   oredered   the   undermount   hardware   just   because .   guess   what   since   we   replaced   the   identical   microwave   the   old   mount   fit   perfectly .   oh   well .   i   really   would   have   loved   it   in   stainless   steel   but   didn   t   see   it   offered .   i   do   hope   this   gives   us   another   15   years   but   at   that   price   i   am   not   too   worried   about   the   track   record .   the   first   ge   over   the   stove   microwave   i   bought   30   years   ago   was   600 !
worst   microwave   for   the   money   looks   great ,   functions   awesome   while   it   is   working .   but   with   the   digital   display ,   it   breaks   very   soon ,   and   when   it   breaks ,   it   feels   like   you   can   t   get   it   fixed .   whirlpool   would   not   respond   well .   they   just   direct   us   to   local   repair   shops ,   and   the   response   from   them   is   horrible .   any   replacement   parts   are   always   on   back   order   and   it   is   just   a   night   mare   to   try   to   work   with   them   sanely .   i   have   been   fighting   with   them   for   more   6   months   now ,   and   i   just   am   so   frustrated   that   i   spend   so   much   money   on   a   product   that   would   only   work   for   few   months ,   and   i   kept   this   useless   microwave   sitting   nicely   in   the   middle   of   my   kitchen ,   just   idle .   horrific   design   and   horrible   customer   service   from   whirlpool .
an   excellent   product   at   a   great   price   we   ve   owner   this   product   for   several   years   now .   it   looks   nice   and   works   great .   amazon   handles   the   shipping   of   this   heavy   product   with   ease   so   you   don   t   need   to   be   concerned   about   it   getting   to   you   in   top   condition .
purchased   on   a   whim   as   good   or   better   than   i   hoped !   lots   of   options ,   fan   is   great .   it   is   noisier   than   my   old   one   as   per   other   reviews   but   really ... it   doesn   t   matter   that   much .
paint   peeling   problems   we   also   experienced   problems   with   the   paint   peeling   in   this   microwave .   it   is   no   longer   under   warrenty   and   i   was   told   by   ge   that   this   was   an   isolated   incident .   obviously ,   that   is   not   the   case .   i   would   not   recommend   this   product   especially   since   ge   is   unwilling   to   stand   behind   their   product .
amazing   microwave   we   have   had   this   microwave   for   about   a   month   and   absolutely   love   it !   well   worth   the   price .   it   is   super   convenient ,   you   can   see   and   stir   the   food   without   removing   it   from   the   oven .   cooks   evenly   and   quickly .   easy   to   use   and   clean .   very   attractive ,   a   conversation   piece   as   well .
lg   microwave   purchased   this   above   the   range   microwave   while   searching   for   a   different   size   by   accident .   kept   it   for   my   work   home ,   work   in   a   different   state   than   we   live .   installed   it   and   it   does   not   work .   been   working   with   the   factory   to   get   it   working   instead   of   returning   it .   still   trying   after   3   weeks .   first   they   sent   me   to   the   wrong   repair   shop ,   then   the   replacement   part   was   bad   and   now   waiting   on   the   2nd   part .   i   don   t   know   if   i   would   be   as   understanding   if   this   was   at   family   home .
plan   to   replace   in   2   3   years   having   had   an   amana   radar   range   for   the   usual   25   years ,   i   was   forced   to   replace   it   when   it   finally   failed .   i   had   even   dropped   it   on   its   end ,   my   mother   ran   it   empty ,   etc . ,   and   it   just   kept   going .   i   replaced   it   with   this   unit   which   i   used   for   coffee ,   leftovers ,   and   maybe   popcorn   heat   ups   nothing   like   the   actual   cooking   i   did   with   the   old   unit   with   its   regular   and   candy   temperature   probes ,   etc .   between   2   3   years   old   it   just   crackled   and   popped   and   limped   along   for   a   day   or   two   with   a   hard   reset .   dead .   the   popcorn   setting   never   worked   other   microwaves   i   have   used   elsewhere   did   a   great   job   nor   was   the   sensing   mechanism   impressive .   i   also   didn   t   like   you   couldn   t   use   the   timer   independently   when   it   was   running .   sure ,   it   may   be   the   magnetron   but   you   have   to   pay   to   diagnose   then   replace .   although   it   is   still   top   rated   on   consumer   reports ,   read   the   users   reviews   to   get   the   true   story .
maybe   best   micro   convection   built .   after   owning   a   previous   sharp   microwave   convection   oven   i   bought   this   one .   installed   5   years   ago   and   still   just   as   pleased   as   the   day   it   was   installed .   excellent   even   microwave   and   oven   performance .   highly   recommend   this   product .
not   reliable   at   all   i   bought   this   microwave   in   april   of   2008 .   after   a   few   months   it   had   intermittent   bleeps   and   flashes   on   the   screen   and   once   even   turned   on   by   itself   it   quickly   turned   itself   off   but   scary   nonetheless   .   then   in   in   april   of   2009   the   screen   went   completely   dead ,   and   whirlpool   was   nice   enough   to   repair   it   at   no   cost   even   though   the   1   year   warranty   was   expired   by   about   a   week .   the   problem   was   a   bad   circuit   board .   now   the   door   hinge   is   broken ,   and   the   turntable   has   stopped   spinning .   for   the   price   of   this   oven   i   expect   it   to   not   fall   apart   in   2   years .   it   cooks   very   well ,   both   microwave   and   convection ,   when   it   works .   but   with   three   major   repairs   in   two   years ,   i   can   t   recommend   it   at   all .   if   you   do   buy   one ,   get   the   extended   warranty .
nice   looking   good   customer   service   so   far   the   installation   dimensions   in   the   install   guide   are   exactly   right .   i   worried   about   trusting   them ,   but   they   worked   very   well .   looks   real   nice ,   works   well ,   and   was   very   easy   to   install .   one   issue ,   when   the   drawer   closed ,   it   made   a   squeeking   sound .   i   figured   it   was   going   back   into   the   box   and   getting   shipped   back .   we   called   sharp   and   they   sent   out   a   technician   who   diagnosed   the   problem   and   ordered   a   replacement   part .   we   ll   have   to   update   if   things   go   south   with   that ,   but   so   far ,   i   appreciated   the   customer   service .   four   stars   because   of   the   squeaking   drawer ,   but   not   one   star   because   the   customer   service   was   so   good .
displeased   with   lg   i   have   an   lg   1680bb   over   the   stove   microwave   which   is   less   than   one   year   old .   the   construction   seems   flimsy   to   me   and   the   controls   do   not   seem   very   well   thought   out .   it   appears   to   me   that   the   controls   are   made   for   a   new   family   with   really   small   children .   the   presets   are   for   things   like   oatmeal ,   babyfood ,   hot   dogs ,   that   sort   of   thing .   the   main   problem   i   have   with   the   oven   is   that   the   handle   just   came   off .   i   looked   closely   at   it   and   the   plastic   around   the   two   screws   which   hold   the   handle   on   is   melted   and   cracked .   it   looks   like   the   microwave   heated   that   area   enough   that   the   plastic   melted   and   then   the   rest   of   the   handle   cracked   until   it   simply   fell   off .   i   will   never   buy   another   lg   microwave   not   unless   they   are   significantly   improved .
great   microwave   microwave   is   very   spacious   works   well   and   is   very   powerful ...   we   love   this   unit ..   arrived   with   faulty   circuit   card   would   not   heat   up .   sharp   warranty   personnel   were   here   within   2   days   and   fixed   it .
don   t   buy   it   i   ve   had   this   mic   for   just   over   a   year ,   and   as   with   others ,   it   just   started   turning   on   by   itself   this   week .   fire   hazard !   thank   god   i   was   home   the   first   time   it   did   it .   it   s   2.30 am   and   it   just   woke   me   up   by   coming   on   again .   spooky   to   say   the   least ,   dangerous   to   say   the   most .   i   can   t   keep   it   plugged   in   anymore ,   and   i   assume ,   based   on   others   experience   that   i   m   reading   online ,   that   it   is   no   longer   safe   and   i   will   have   to   get   rid   of   it .   what   a   rip   off .
good   and   cheap   and   it   works   i   bought   the   1.6   cu   ft   white   one   of   these .   my   older   and   twice   as   expensive   whirlpool   died   and   i   didn   t   want   to   spend   another   500   bucks   on   something   that   i   now   realize   is   a   disposable   item .   when   these   break ,   almost   any   repair   will   cost   as   much   as   a   new   unit   so   i   decided   to   stop   buying   top   tier   on   these   ovens .   this   unit   was   easy   to   install .   it   s   lighter   than   my   whirlpool   was ,   so   i   was   able   to   hoist   it   onto   the   mounting   plate   myself   and   start   the   top   screws   without   a   problem .   i   think   perhaps   those   who   are   complaining   about   the   weight   bought   the   larger   model   who   knows .   sometimes   it   s   hard   to   tell   what   some   folks   bought   in   these   amazon   reviews .   br   br   as   others   report ,   the   fan   is   really   loud .   wow .   and   low   fan   is   just   as   loud .   the   fan   is   definitely   the   down   side .   i   found   that   the   light   is   bright   enough .   cooking   is   fast .   the   control   panel   is   very   spartan .   oh ,   it   has   all   the   buttons ,   but   where   my   old   microwave   said   pizza   and   casserole   etc .   in   the   display ,   this   one   just   has   a   numeral   and   you   ll   have   to   refer   to   the   book   a   bit   until   you   get   the   hang   of   it .   most   of   my   cooking   is   just   hitting   the   quick   button   anyway ,   so   let   s   be   real .   i   m   glad   it   doesn   t   have   a   lot   of   features   i   ll   seldom   use   and   that   i   would   have   had   to   pay   for .   the   door   looks   solid   enough   to   me .   i   see   no   problem   with   keeping   it   clean   that   others   have   reported ,   but   perhaps   that   s   because   mine   is   white   so   it   s   a   good   basic   microwave ,   as   cheap   as   they   come   and   it   works   just   fine .   i   consider   it   a   5   star   cheap   microwave .   br   br   edit   added   br   well ,   it   has   stopped   working   properly   after   6   months .   most   annoying   is   that   the   interior   light   will   not   turn   off   even   though   the   door   switches   are   working   properly .   while   i   liked   the   spartan   controls ,   my   wife   learned   to   detest   that   feature .   i   ve   decided   not   to   have   it   repaired   under   warranty ,   but   to   be   rid   of   it   and   buy   a   unit   with   better   build   quality .   i   m   dropping   it   down   to   3   stars .   it   will   probably   be   discontinued   soon   anyway   but   hate   to   leave   my   former   rave   review   in   place   without   changing   it . without   changing   it .
everything   microwave   right   size ,   cooks   everything ,   fast   and   convenient .   just   right   for   my   needs .   can   t   go   wrong   with   the   deal   or   the   unit .
ge   spacemaker   microwave   oven   i   purchased   a   ge   profile   spacemaker   2.0   oven   model   jvm2070   bho2   in   2007 .   about   a   year   later   the   handle   came   off   in   my   hand .   i   did   my   own   repair   but   in   so   doing   found   the   quality   of   construction   to   be   quite   poor .   self   threaded   screws   in   inferior   quality   plastic   was   the   problem .   now ,   the   keypad   will   not   accept   any   inputs .   ge   only   sells   a   control   assembly   at   nearly   400   the   oven   originally   cost   about   500   .   ge   says   their   ovens   are   not   consumer   repairable   and   refer   customers   to   a   repair   facility .   my   options   are   to   pay   a   ge   technician   75.00   to   tell   me   the   control   assembly   must   be   replaced   at   a   cost   of   400   or   buy   another   brand   of   oven   with   a   longer   service   life .   which   option   do   you   think   i   will   choose  
dont   buy   this   product   too   many   problems   for   a   high   end   microwave .   after   1   year   of   use ,   the   handle   broke .   the   convection   piece   of   it   will   not   work .   stay   away   from   this   product .

very   pleased   excellent   price   and   product   2   day   shipping   with   amazon   prime   another   really   good   investment !   .   this   has   turned   out   to   be   a   very   good   buy   as   a   replacement   for   a   sears   kenmore   over   the   range   microwave   which   was   useless   from   day   one .   it   fits   well ,   very   secure   mounts   and   easy   to   use   template .   oven   itself   is   easy   to   use ,   quiet ,   powerful ,   excellent   venting   in   our   case   out   the   top   to   the   roof   .   everything   has   been   easy   to   clean   so   far   including   the   buttons   and   window   .   i   put   it   in   myself   but   two   person   job   would   have   been   a   better   choice .   really   like   the   sensor   cooking   so   i   don   t   have   to   figure   out   how   long   it   will   take   to   burn   the   rice   this   time ...   .   definitely   recommend   this   oven .
buyer   beware   of   ge !   please   read   the   reviews ,   it   could   save   you   time ,   money   and   frustration .   i   also   bought   a   ge   microwave   cafe   thought   it   would   be   a   quality   product   because   i   paid   over   400.00 ,   it   also   started   dying   after   the   first   year ,   the   magnatron ,   which   has   a   five   year   warrenty   was   corroded   and   had   to   be   replaced   at   an   additional   repair   cost ,   part   was   free .   one   day   after   the   30   day   repair   warrenty   the   microwave   totally   died   800   .   repair   failed   to   come   during   appointed   time ,   in   fairness   they   later   said   they   had   called   and   rescheduled ,   but   i   had   no   message   on   my   phone   so   i   waited   for   4   hours .   the   manager   i   spoke   to   was   willing   to   have   me   wait   another   five   hours   on   another   day ,   that   s   the   best   they   could   do .   so   if   you   want   to   throw   your   money   away   and   get   poor   service ,   definitely   buy   ge   products !
review   magic   chef   this   is   awesome !   love   it !   it   was   easy   to   install !   cooking   and   defrosting   is   very   well !   and   the   shipping   was   early !   very   happy   overall !
works   well .   looks   good .   few   negatives   i   like   the   look   and   functionality   of   this   microwave   and   it   is   at   a   good   price   compared   to   others .   my   only   negative   feedback   is   that   i   feel   it   is   a   little   loud   when   turned   on   my   husband   thinks   i   only   hate   this   because   i   don   t   like   loud   noises   and   it   doesn   t   heat   things   as   fast   as   our   old   microwave .   for   this   one ,   if   the   recommended   cooking   time   is   3   5   minutes   i   will   have   to   put   it   in   for   about   3   30 ,   where   on   our   old   one   i   could   put   it   in   for   2   45 .   overall ,   though ,   it   is   a   good   product   at   a   good   price   and   has   good   functionality .
don   t   waste   your   money !   we   bought   one   of   these   in   october   09 .   it   took   three   vists   from   a   whirlpool   repair   service   before   they   could   get   the   convection   part   to   work .   we   weren   t   able   to   use   the   convection   portion   until   late   december   09 .   now   that   it   works ,   it   is   extremely   noisy   both   during   cooking   and   during   cool   down .   yes ,   cool   down .   when   you   are   finihed   cooking   it   goes   into   a   cool   down   mode   for   about   another   15   minutes   and   is   just   as   noisy .   i   admit   that   the   micro   wave   works   great   and   it   has   many   features   we   like .   my   advice   is   to   buy   a   microwave   and   a   good   broiler   oven ,   if   you   are   like   us   and   do   mostly   cooking   for   two .
too   loud   and   too   many   beeps   this   microwave   was   a   good   price   but   it   wakes   people   up   with   the   loud   operation   and   multiple   beeps .   door   also   does   not   seem   solid   and   is   very   loud   if   you   are   not   holding   it   tight   when   you   open   and   close .   was   not   worth   the   price   considering   all   the   noise .
seems   like   it   was   constructed   to   fail   on   or   about   expiration   of   guarantee   beware .   i   bought   this   over   the   range   microwave   in   march   of   2009 ,   and   it   stopped   working   completely   yesterday   feb   25   2010   .   i   use   it   once   or   twice   per   day .   normal   stuff   like   tv   dinners .   it   looks   very   nice ,   but   it   was   not   built   to   last .   i   bought   it   online   and   i   m   hunting   through   my   archived   e   mails   trying   to   find   my   receipt   so   that   i   can   get   it   serviced   preferably   replaced   .   earliest   appointment   is   in   a   week ,   so   i   am   without   a   microwave   for   at   least   a   week .
decent   low   cost   over   the   range   this   unit   was   a   replacement   for   a   slightly   earlier   model   that   failed .   it   is   nice   that   the   lg   over   the   range   family   generally   uses   the   same   wall   mount ,   so   installation   was   easy   as   a   replacement .   it   works   fine ,   though   if   you   are   a   heavy   users   of   microwaves ,   i   am   not   sure   what   the   real   durability   is ,   but   since   we   are   light   users ,   the   prior   model   lasted   several   years ,   and   expect   this   will   too .

good   microwave   but   ge   must   think   it   s   a   disposable .   we   bought   this   microwave   jes2251sj02   in   jan .   of   07 .   it   works   pretty   well .   i   like   the   inverter   defrost   capabilities .   recently   dec .   09   the   oven   bulb   part   wb36x10302   burnt   out .   not   a   critical   problem   but   a   definite   pain   in   the   a   .   so   far   my   choices   in   fixing   it   are   1   open   it   up   and   poke   around   trying   to   fix   it   myself .   carefully !   there   s   reported   to   be   high   voltage   capacitors   in   there   that   can   permanently   ruin   your   day   and   all   your   days   to   come .   there   is   apparently   no   manual   available   that   will   tell   you   how   do   do   this   or   what   to   watch   out   for .   2   pay   for   a   ge   technician   to   come   to   the   house   69   and   replace   the   bulb   12   20   i   think ,   the   ge   appointment   scheduler   doesn   t   know   but   i   found   it   online   for   11.75   plus   labor .   how   much   do   ge   techs   charge   per   hour   ge   maint .   doesn   t   know   or   won   t   say .   how   long   will   it   take   to   complete   the   job   ge   maint .   doesn   t   know   or   won   t   say .   let   s   estimate   that   the   labor   involved   takes   half   an   hour   to   pull   the   cover   off   and   dismantle   the   thing   enough   to   get   to   the   bulb   and   replace   it .   if   the   tech   charges   only   50   hr   probably   considerably   more   that   s   a   total   of   106   house   call   parts   labor   .   i   paid   233   for   the   thing   new .   i   need   to   pay   almost   half   the   purchase   price   to   fix   a   burned   out   bulb   2   yrs   later   time   to   think   about   not   buying   anymore   ge   appliances .
stopped   working   after   a   year   just   like   with   the   previous   reviewer ,   this   microwave   worked   well   until   it   didn   t   work   at   all .   it   started   turning   itself   on   and   then   the   keypad   stopped   working .   since   we   had   bought   the   house   with   the   microwave ,   we   didn   t   have   the   info   we   needed   to   return   it   but   on   the   instruction   manual ,   the   previous   owner   wrote   that   it   was   installed   in   2008   and   the   oven   stopped   working   at   the   end   of   2009 .   the   manufacture   date   on   the   unit   said   december   2007   so   it   was   less   than   2   years   old .
died   after   one   year   of   light   operation ...   this   model   performed   as   to   be   expected ...   it   adequately   heated   items .   after   just   over   one   year   it   suddenly   suffered   a   short   and   started   starting   by   itself .   additionally ,   the   control   pad   stopped   working .   we   temporarily   overcame   the   problem   by   leaving   the   unit   unplugged   until   needed   and   it   then   only   sometimes   functioned .   perhaps   the   old   adage   is   correct   in   you   get   what   you   pay   for .
terrible   quality   i   am   changing   my   five   star   to   a   one   star   review .   br   br   the   product   cooked   food   well ,   but   despite   gentle   use   we   read   reviews   here   noting   a   cracked   door   ,   our   door   has   cracked ,   then   cracked   again ,   and   then   the   handle   itself   has   snapped   off .   the   material   quality   is   very   poor .   we   were   very   gentle   with   this   unit ,   but   it   s   simply   a   very   low   quality   product .   br   br   absolutely   do   not   purchase   this .
this   is   my   favorite   kitchen   appliance ! ! !   we   installed   sharp   model   kb6524   in   june   2009   during   a   kitchen   remodel .   every   appliance   in   our   kitchen   is   new   and   this   particular   appliance   is   my   favorite   due   to   the   uniqueness   and   convenience   of   this   model .   this   microwave   has   exceeded   our   expectations   in   every   way .   one   of   the   reasons   we   bought   this   microwave   was   that   we   needed   a   microwave   that   would   fit   under   the   countertop   so   our   kids   could   reach   it .   it   is   also   nice   that   the   door   slides   open   and   i   can   reach   down   to   lift   out   the   food   instead   of   having   to   reach   up   at   face   level   and   lift   food   out   and   down .   i   liked   the   unique   concept   of   a   drawer   that   pulls   open   instead   of   a   door   that   pops   open .   i   was   a   little   concerned   about   reviews   on   earlier   models   that   the   auto   open   and   close   function   on   this   microwave   has   a   tendency   to   break .   however ,   it   seems   that   sharp   decided   to   manufacture   this   one   so   it   closes   with   a   button   or   by   pushing   or   pulling   on   it   to   eliminate   that   problem .   i   was   also   concerned   that   it   didn   t   have   a   piece   in   it   that   rotates   the   food .   so ,   we   were   surprised   to   find   that   none   of   the   food   we   have   cooked   has   hotspots   note   i   only   use   my   microwave   for   reheating ... not   cooking   .   i   love   this   microwave .   i   had   considered   purchasing   the   30   but   decided   that   it   was   unlikely   that   i   would   need   to   put   a   dish   in   the   microwave   that   was   bigger   than   24 .   so   far ,   this   has   been   the   perfect   size .   it   is   even   tall   enough   that   i   can   put   my   portable   mug   in   it   to   heat   up   my   tea .   also ,   my   lovely   daughter   did   not   know   that   you   can   t   put   metal   in   the   microwave .   she   put   her   fork   in   with   her   plate .   surprisingly ,   the   microwave   did   not   arch .   we   checked   the   manual   and   it   said   you   can   even   use   aluminum   foil   to   cover   portions   of   meat .   not   sure   how   they   do   it ,   but   i   m   not   likely   to   try   it .   the   microwave   seems   fine   after   the   fork   episode .   this   microwave   also   has   programmable   features   such   as   softening   ice   cream .   it   asks   what   size   of   ice   cream   then   sets   the   time   as   appropriate .   it   s   a   nice   feature   but   i   m   not   usually   softening   a   whole   tub   ofice   cream .   just   a   portion   of   a   tub .   one   other   feature   i   use   frequently ,   pushing   the   power   button   after   closing   the   drawer   will   turn   on   the   microwave   in   one   minute   increments .   as   an   example ,   pushing   the   button   3   times   will   equate   to   3   minutes .   this   is   a   pricey   microwave   but   has   been   well   worth   the   expense   in   our   experience .   i   highly   recommend   this   microwave !
this   one   does   everything   for   you   this   is   the   neatest   microwave   i   have   ever   worked   with .   it   does   everything   for   you .   the   controls   are   easy   to   use   and   very   easy   to   see .   i   can   not   say   enough   about   the   guy   we   purchased   this   from .   he   went   above   and   beyond   to   make   sure   we   got   the   microwave   before   we   left   town   driving   from   ca .   to   or   to   meet   me .
excellent   microwave   i   purchased   this   unit   to   replace   a   sharp   r   2110jw   smart   carousel   which   proved   to   be   a   piece   of   junk .   what   a   contrast !   for   about   the   same   price   this   unit   is   much   higher   quality .   the   controls   are   well   thought   out .   the   door   is   designed   with   the   window   built   in .   the   sharp   has   a   plastic   overlay   glued   on   that   fell   off   after   a   couple   months .   the   wall   mounting   was   very   easy   and   straightforward .   overall   i   couldn   t   be   much   happier !   lg   has   won   a   convert !
broken   after   2.5   years   this   microwave   came   with   our   new   house .   it   started   making   noises   and   is   now   smoking .   what   happened   to   microwaves   that   last  
looks   great   but   very   prone   to   breaking !   i   have   had   this   microwave   for   1   year   now ,   it   has   broken   3   times   and   sharp   has   been   terrible   about   getting   it   fixed   under   the   warranty .   opening   shutting   the   drawer   is   very   sensitive   therefore   the   drawer   stops   working .   no   turntable   which   means   you   need   to   manually   spin   your   food   around   as   needed .   overly   complicated   directions .   too   expensive   for   what   you   get !
good   family   size   microwave .   this   sharp   microwave   is   great   for   a   family .   its   large   size   is   a   big   plus .   easy   operation   and   nice   finish   and   very   powerful .   we   had   an   lg   oven   before   and   it   is   a   junk   !   it   lasted   only   2   years .   our   old   microwave   was   a   sharp   also   and   its   still   working   after   20   years !   my   rating   a  
problem   with   filters   i   have   been   unable   to   find   filters   that   fit   this   microwave .   i   ordered   some   through   sharp   and   they   didn   t   fit .   sharp   told   me   that   i   would   have   to   get   a   service   man   out   to   install   them .   the   service   man   could   not   install   them   and   he   called   sharp   and   was   told   that   there   was   a   design   error   and   there   were   no   filters   available   for   this   model .   sharp   would   not   reimburse   me   for   the   expense   of   the   service   call .   otherwise ,   it   is   a   great   microwave   convection   oven .
good   basic   microwave   i   bought   this   microwave   to   replace   my   previous   sharp   r   1449 .   this   one   is   deeper ,   more   plastic ,   and   slightly   more   powerful .   it   seems   reliable   only   have   had   it   6   weeks   ,   has   a   good   vent   and   good   stove   lights .   i   wish   it   had   a   night   light   and   a   switch   to   stop   turntable   rotation   though   one   can   get   around   it   by   removing   the   turntable .   my   biggest   disappointment   was   that   it   utilizes   a   different   mounting   plate   than   my   previous   sharp   microwave .   i   gave   it   four   stars   b   c   it   does   the   job   and   it   was   inexpensive   compared   to   other   manufacturers .   incidentally ,   mounting   instructions   were   very   good .
great   microwave   and   convectional   oven   i   ve   selected   this   model ,   because   it   is   the   only   convectional   microwave   oven   that   fits   my   kitchen .   other   models   require   some   extra   space   in   front   of   the   microwave   on   the   left   side ,   to   be   able   to   open   the   door .   it   is   not   a   problem   for   most   kitchens ,   but   if   you   have   a   deep   cabinet   to   the   left   of   the   microwave   that   extends   in   front   of   oven ,   sharp   seems   like   the   only   option .   sharp   has   put   a   smaller   door   that   starts   about   an   inch   from   the   left   side   of   the   microwave ,   so   it   opens   freely .   so   far   i   was   not   disappointed .   i   m   mostly   using   the   microwave   mode ,   convectional   mode .   it   cooks   well ,   and   the   menu   is   rather   intiutive   what   else   do   you   need   auto   reheat   works   well   and   produces   consistently   good   results .   i   was   not   getting   very   good   result   with   mixed   mode   oven   microwave   though .   there   are   some   faults   in   this   model ,   that   i   think   sharp   should   ve   done   better ,   so   it   only   got   4   starts   1   the   menu   system   could   be   better .   e . g .   the   start   button   on   most   microwaves   also   serves   as   add   minute   or   add   30sec   ,   but   here   it   would   not   do   anything   one   has   to   use   dedicated   add   minute   button .   i   got   used   to   it ,   but   my   guests   can   t   easily   find   this   button .   2   the   fan   is   very   very   loud .   it   has   two   speeds ,   but   even   with   reduced   speed ,   it   is   very   loud .   it   does   not   look   extremely   powerful   either .   3   the   range   light   is   generated   by   two   small   incandescent   bulbs .   i   would   expect   energy   efficient   fluorescent   lamps   or   leds   for   this   high   end   oven .   they   could   ve   perfectly   fit   a   long   tube   there ,   but   have   instead   put   old   unefficient   incandescent   bulbs .   4   the   interior   is   stainless   steeel ,   but   it   is   not   very   smooth ,   so   it   takes   some   effort   to   clean   the   microwave .
gorgeous ,   efficient   and   chic !   this   microwave   is   wonderful .   the   quick   heat   buttons   are   convenient   and   easy   to   use .   if   you   read   consumer   reports ,   it   says   this   or   similiar   microwave   has   only   a   useful   space   of   0.9   cubic   feet .   not   so .   this   has   a   full   2.0   cubic   feet   of   space   which   is   great   for   cooking   a   ham   or   a   large   casserole   dish .   very   sharp   design ,   useful   and   adequate   lighting   underneath .   for   the   installation   do   it   yourselfers   it   s   60   pounds   and   you   have   to   lift   it   above   your   shoulders   if   you   are   installing   over   a   stove .   follow   the   instructions   to   the   letter ,   and   all   will   turn   out   great .   the   directions   are   very   good .   note   if   you   can ,   remove   your   stove   before   installing   the   microwave .   the   mfgr   doesn   t   mention   this ,   but   it   made   things   a   lot   easier   and   i   got   to   clean   under   it !   ... 2   3   3   preferred   people   are   definitely   needed   to   install   this   safely   due   to   its   weight   and   awkward   size .   i   recommend   this   microwave   highly !
great !   great   microwave   at   great   price .   i   bought   one   from   amazon . com   last   month   for   199 .   it   arrived   in   one   week .   no   shipping   charge .   looks   great .   works   great .   installed   easily .   professionally   installed   for   65 .   nice   clean   lines .   easy   to   operate .   hit   the   button   once   for   one   minute .   hit   it   again   for   each   additional   minute .
beware   the   bummer   oven   i   had   to   buy   this   model   microwave   because   my   kitchen   built   ins   were   constructed   to   fit   an   earlier   sharp   model   in   this   line .   i   loved   the   old   one ,   even   though   it   only   lasted   9   years ,   but   this   one   has   been   a   tremendous   disappointment .   first   off ,   amazon   does   not   tell   you   until   after   your   purchase   that   they   subcontract   out   delivery   to   a   third   party   who   prohibits   you   from   speaking   with   the   driver   via   his   cellphone   and   thinks   nothing   of   dropping   the   ball   re   customer   communication   i   wasted   an   entire   day   waiting   for   a   delivery   man   who   did   not   ring   my   bell   as   instructed   and   had   instead   delivered   it   to   my   super ,   which   no   one   bothered   to   tell   me .   the   delivery   was   an   extremely   frustrating   fiasco .   amazon   needs   to   take   more   responsibility   vis   a   vis   decent   delivery   services .   next   point   of   disappointment   i   paid   two   men   to   install   this   monster .   it   s   practically   80   lbs .   and   impossible   to   install   solo   .   so   they   get   it   in   and   fitting   properly   into   the   drop   in   shelf   designed   to   hold   it .   then   comes   another   surprise   every   time   i   turn   it   on ,   it   makes   a   tremendous   rattley   racket   not   unlike   a   jet   turbine   nothing   at   all   like   the   smooth ,   quiet   operation   of   its   predecessor .   this   noise   is   so   loud   you   can   t   even   think   about   listening   to   npr   or   a   fellow   kitchen   occupant   during   the   oven   s   operation .   if   i   press   firmly   on   the   door   of   the   microwave   while   it   s   on ,   the   noise   mutes ,   but   who   can   stand   in   front   of   the   microwave   pressing   on   it   every   time   you   zap   a   potato   i   m   not   sure   if   the   ace   delivery   company   rattled   something   loose   inside   this   particular   appliance ,   or   if   this   series   model   contains   a   design   flaw ,   but   the   noise   is   really   horrible .   there   s   more   i   was   very   impressed   with   the   ease   of   baking   in   this   oven   the   programming   is   simple   enough   for   a   liberal   arts   major   to   grasp   quite   easily .   but   every   time   i   use   the   convection   function   closely   following   all   the   instructions   re   appropriate   containers ,   elevating   the   foodstuffs   off   the   rotating   plate ,   etc . ,   the   oven   gives   off   a   menacing   odor   exactly   like   you   sniff   in   a   terrible   electrical   fire .   there   is   nothing   in   the   manual   concerning   either   the   noise   issue   or   the   smell   issue .   i   m   in   nyc ,   where   there   are   very   few   options   when   searching   for   a   specific   appliance   i   tried   to   find   one   locally   that   would   fit   my   shelf   space   ,   but   if   i   could   have ,   i   would   have   previewed   this   model   at   a   local   retailer   and   seen   how   it   worked   there   before   springing   for   such   an   expensive   lemon .   because   this   behemouth   is   such   a   hassle   to   remove   and   install ,   it   s   the   kind   of   thing   which ,   if   you   do   buy   it ,   you   should   buy   with   a   guarantee   of   local   on   site   service .   so   far ,   this   oven   s   cost   me   1 , 000 .
decent   oven ,   inexpensive ,   not   too   bad   to   install .   i   bought   this   oven   to   replace   a   whirlpool   of   equal   size .   i   like   the   lg .   it   s   a   little   more   powerful ,   and   the   moisture   sensor   seems   to   work   pretty   well .   it   s   a   heavy   beast   and   you   will   want   to   use   the   template   that   comes   with   it   to   lay   out   the   installation   bracket   positions   and   holes   for   the   support   bolts .   get   those   right   and   the   installation   is   no   big   deal .   it   does   take   two   people   to   horse   this   60   lb .   appliance   into   place   while   starting   the   bolts ,   threading   the   cord   etc .   it   took   me   a   couple   of   hours   from   opening   the   box   to   firing   it   up   and   i   was   a   cabinet   installer   in   my   youth .   still ,   no   big   deal .   tip   use   a   light   spray   adhesive   to   attach   the   layout   template   to   the   bottom   of   upper   support   cabinet .
a   good   product   that   looks   good   we   are   very   pleased   with   the   sharp   microwave .   it   works   very   well ,   has   easy   to   follow   directions   and   looks   great .
  150   of   repairs   in   5   years   we   ve   had   an   earlier   model   range   hood   style   sharp   oven   for   five   years .   we   ve   had   to   replace   the   circuit   board   and   it   has   gone   through   three   door   handles .   there   is   no   one   in   our   household   who   misuses   appliances ,   so   the   door   handle   problem   plastic   that   is   not   strong   enough   to   withstand   the   pulling   pressure   of   the   door   catch   simply   shows   the   inferior   quality   of   sharp   parts .   i   ve   actually   hoped   that   the   oven   itself   would   stop   working   so   i   d   have   a   legitimate   reason   to   replace   it   i   can   t   bear   the   idea   of   throwing   out   a   functioning   appliance .   this   is   why   i   give   it   2   stars .   but   this   machine   will   have   cost   me   150   in   repairs   if   i   replace   the   broken   handle   again .
over   the   range   microwave   the   microwave   oven   arrived   on   time   and   in   excellent   condition .   we   have   tested   it   to   make   sure   it   works .   it   was   just   installed   so   we   haven   t   used   it   a   lot   yet ..... completely   happy ... excellent   amazon   service   as   usual .
lg   electronics   microwave   i   love   this   microwave .   it   was   worth   waiting   for .   i   had   ordered   this   microwave   from   4   other   companies   that   said   they   had   it   in   stock   and   then   called   to   tell   me   they   were   backordered . amazon   delivered .   thanks
not   a   reliable   microwave   we   bought   this   microwave   2   years   ago .   it   worked   well   during   that   time ,   but   it   recently   stopped   working .   we   were   warming   up   some   food   when   the   microwave   started   smoking .   when   we   opened   the   door ,   all   we   could   smell   was   the   stench   of   burnt   plastic .   after   waiting   a   day   for   the   smell   to   clear   out ,   i   tried   running   the   microwave   with   nothing   in   it .   after   10   seconds ,   i   opened   the   door   and   could   again   smell   the   burnt   plastic .   on   the   right   side   of   the   microwave   behind   the   metal   grate   where   all   the   wiring   is ,   i   could   hear   sizzling .   the   internal   wiring   was   melting   and   that   was   causing   the   smell   and   smoke .   in   searching   for   a   new   microwave   to   replace   this   one ,   i   read   in   consumer   reports   that   sharp   brand   microwaves   are   a   repair   prone   brand .   as   other   reviewers   have   stated ,   this   is   a   good ,   basic   microwave .   but ,   if   you   are   expecting   it   to   last   for   several   years ,   i   d   select   a   different   brand   and   model .   frigidaire ,   whirlpool ,   maytag ,   amana ,   ge ,   and   kenmore   sears   all   get   good   ratings   for   reliability   from   consumer   reports .
poor   product   worse   customer   service   i   should   have   listened   to   my   wife .   i   m   about   to   arrange   to   take   my   third   monday   afternoon   in   a   row   off   from   work   so   i   can   be   here   for   ge   s   service   technician .   he   s   repairing   my   microwave ,   which   is   less   than   6   weeks   old .   here   s   what   happened .   week   1 ,   i   call   the   service   center ,   describe   the   problem   i   m   having   power   cuts   off   after   a   few   seconds   and   the   rep   says   it   s   probably   an   inverter   board ,   and   schedules   a   repair   call .   week   2 ,   the   technician   arrives ,   diagnoses   the   problem   and   says   it   s   an   inverter   board .   he   orders   the   part .   week   3 , the   part   has   arrived ,   the   repair   guy   comes   to   install   it ,   but   it   s   the   wrong   part .   he   has   to   order   the   right   part ,   i   have   to   take   a   third   day   off   from   work   to   be   available ,   and   we   have   to   go   another   week   without   a   microwave .   wouldn   t   the   right   thing   for   ge   to   have   done   is   replace   the   microwave   just   ship   us   a   new   one ,   and   have   us   ship   the   old   one   back   or   have   the   repair   guy   make   the   swap   that   would   be   showing   ge   cares   about   their   customer   s   time ,   they   re   concerned   if   they   waste   time   because   of   their   error ,   and   keeping   customers   satisfied   is   its   top   priority .   instead ,   ge   parrots   back   the   warranty   we   only   have   to   repair   the   appliance ,   not   replace   it   and   disregards   what   this   experience   has   meant   to   its   customer   and   his   perception   of   their   company .
cool   kitchen   i   have   never   owned   a   convection   oven   before .   i   love   it !   living   in   the   south   and   only   cooking   for   2   people ,   why   heat   up   the   whole   kitchen !   it   s   so   easy   to   use .   i   bake   everything   in   it   now .   i   also   use   most   of   my   pampered   chef   stones   in   it   for   even   easier   clean   up !
flimsy   door   construction   lasted   16   months   bought   the   sharp   r   1874   in   november   2006   and   immediately   noticed   that   the   entire   unit   appeared   to   be   of   flimsy   construction .   now   the   door   will   not   seal   properly   and   it   will   only   work   in   the   micro   or   convection   mode   if   the   user   continually   keeps   pressure   on   the   latch .   a   ridiculous   situation .   sharp   usa   was   no   help   and   a   repairman   gave   me   a   230   quote   to   fix   it .
poor   reliability   i   am   very   disappointed   at   the   poor   reliability   of   this   unit .   ours   is   less   than   a   year   old   and   has   failed   now ,   when   attempting   to   cook ,   the   unit   shuts   off   before   the   end   of   the   programmed   time .   even   though   the   light   comes   on   and   the   turntable   turns ,   the   unit   does   not   heat   food .   like   others ,   i   purchased   this   unit   based   on   the   recommendation   in   consumer   reports   this   recommendation   didn   t   pan   out .   i   tried   to   schedule   warranty   service   and   ge   is   making   us   wait   a   week   to   schedule   and   their   frustrating   telephone   system   does   not   provide   information   on   where   i   can   take   it   for   service   for   faster   turnaround   and   didn   t   put   me   in   touch   with   a   live   representative   .   when   the   microwave   oven   worked ,   it   worked   fine .   we   replaced   a   sharp   unit   with   this   one   though   this   unit   has   the   advantage   of   a   larger   capacity ,   its   controls   are   less   intuitive .   based   on   poor   reliability   and   poor   service ,   we   re   certainly   not   going   to   buy   another   ge   microwave .   we   ve   had   good   success   with   ge   refrigerators   in   the   past   this   is   very   disappointing .   a   quick   search   on   the   web   now   reveals   that   ge   microwave   ovens   are   not   reliable   many   others   appear   to   have   similar   problems   with   the   magnetrons .   perhaps   this   is   one   reason   why   ge   is   looking   to   sell   its   appliance   business ...
larger   and   more   powerful   but   short   service   life   e .   j .   tastad   s   review   of   this   product   is   accurate   and   appropriate ,   but   i   would   like   to   add   some   additional   information .   i   bought   this   ge   profile   microwave   oven   in   march   of   2006   on   the   recommendation   of   consumer   reports .   in   september   2009   i   am   sorry   to   report   that   i   had   to   throw   it   out   because   it   wasn   t   worth   repairing .   consumer   reports   gave   this   ge   model   their   top   rating   for   large   microwave   ovens .   it   replaced   an   old   amana   radarrange   that   i   had   used   for   about   25   years   before   it   burst   into   flames .   the   amana   had   also   received   consumer   reports   top   rating   back   then .   if   i   recall ,   my   amana   sold   for   about   twice   as   much   money   in   1981   dollars   as   this   ge   costs   in   2006   dollars .   br   br   since   this   microwave   oven   is   more   powerful ,   faster   and   consumes   more   electricity   than   small   models ,   you   may   need   to   have   a   dedicated   20   ampere   outlet   available   for   its   use .   compared   with   my   old   amana ,   the   ge   has   a   much   more   uniform   distribution   of   heat   when   cooking   or   reheating ,   probably   because   the   food   is   rotated   on   a   turntable .   as   e .   j .   tastad   found ,   the   defrost   cycle   is   easy   to   use ,   gives   good   distribution   of   heat   and   the   front   panel   controls   are   fairly   intuitive .   the   stainless   steel   cabinet   is   attractive   and   easy   to   clean .   br   br   unlike   my   old   amana ,   this   oven   cannot   multi   task .   for   example ,   if   you   re   running   the   built   in   clock   timer ,   you   cannot   cook   or   reheat   something   on   a   different   schedule   using   different   functions .   you   must   stop   the   clock   timer   to   begin   a   cook   cycle   and   vice   versa .   you   also   cannot   program   several   sequences   of   automatic   operations   as   my   old   amana   could   accommodate ,   nor   can   you   program   it   to   start   at   a   later   time .   br   br   this   microwave   oven   was   not   as   reliable   and   did   not   last   nearly   as   long   as   my   old   amana   did .   the   magnetron   tube   in   my   ge   profile   microwave   oven   failed   after   two   years   of   use .   it   s   replacement   was   covered   by   the   five   year   ge   warranty   on   the   tube ,   but   the   warranty   didn   t   cover   the   85   in   labor   charges ,   which   would   have   been   even   more   if   i   had   received   the   service   on   site   instead   of   taking   the   appliance   to   the   appliance   repair   depot .   after   3   1   2   years   of   use ,   september   2009   the   main   circuit   board   self   destructed .   it   cost   me   44   at   the   nearest   ge   repair   facility   to   learn   that   it   would   cost   me   more   than   another   200   to   replace   the   microwave   oven   s   circuit   board .   br   br   since   other   brands   of   similar   sized   and   power   microwave   ovens   cost   less   than   the   repairs ,   i   have   discarded   this   microwave   oven   after   3   1   2   years   and   after   spending   129   in   diagnostic   and   repair   charges   in   addition   to   the   purchase   price .   given   this   experience ,   i   now   be   hard   pressed   to   recommend   this   appliance   considering   its   cost   of   ownership   and   short   life .   this   appliance   should   have   lasted   much   longer .   it   did   not   get   heavy   use   and   was   never   misused   or   abused .   br   br   when   i   contacted   ge   about   my   failed   microwave   oven ,   they   promised   to   make   things   right ,   asked   for   the   model   and   serial   number   and   requested   that   i   cut   off   the   appliance   s   power   cord   and   plug   and   send   it   to   them .   they   then   sent   me   a   100   rebate   check   that   could   be   applied   only   to   another   ge   appliance   purchase .   the   check   expired   before   i   found   another   ge   appliance   that   i   wanted   to   own .   br   br   i   bought   a   replacement ,   which   was   a   panasonic   model   nn   sd978s   microwave   oven   for   less   than   200   from   sam   s   club .   it   is   just   as   large ,   cooks   faster   and   has   proven   to   be   far   more   reliable .   after   four   years ,   it   s   still   going   strong   without   need   for   repairs . ore   if   i   had   received   the   service   on   site   instead   of   taking   the   appliance   to   the   appliance   repair   depot .   after   3   1   2

microwell   report   this   appliance   works   much   better   than   my   last   sharp .   as   for   noise   complaint   i   didn   t   find   it   to   much   different   than   my   old   microwave .   only   bad   part   about   stainless   steel   is   that   you   see   all   the   fingerprints   everywhere .   really   liked   the   speedy   service .

deliberated   long   hard   520ks   great   choice   after   too   much   research ,   i   settled   on   this   terrific   microwave .   every   brand   of   microwave   seems   to   have   a   malfunction   no   help   horror   story .   so   in   the   end ,   if   you   chance   having   a   microwave   at   all ,   this   one   seems   better   than   most ,   if   not   all .   it   works   splendidly   without   any   problem   with   noise   or   mechanical   parts .   my   experience   with   sharp   carousels   has   been   5   stars .   at   home   and   work   they   have   been   dependable ,   efficient ,   good   looking ,   and   inexpensive .   both   the   2.0   and   1.4   cubic   foot   carousels   are   commodious   enough   for   large   casseroles .   when   i   designed   my   kitchen   twenty   years   ago ,   i   made   two   below   counter   cabinet   spaces   to   tuck   in   a   medium   and   a   large   countertop   microwave .   i   bought   carousels   and   have   used   them   simultaneously   almost   daily .   they   have   been   great   workhorses .   the   smaller   one   lost   some   of   the   digital   display   to   no   effect   a   few   months   ago ,   then   made   nasty   little   arcing   noises   last   week   and   promptly   was   sent   out   to   pasture .   last   year   i   bought   new   stainless   steel   appliances   including   bosch   dual   fuel   slide   in   range   the   dream   machine   ,   and   so   i   chose   the   stainless   steel   sharp   r   408ls   carousel   1.4   cubic   foot   1100   w   with   a   14   inch   turntable   from   bj   s   99   as   a   replacement .   the   match   with   the   other   appliances   was   so   good   that   i   replaced   the   2   cubic   foot   1200   w   with   sharp   s   r   520ks   microwave   as   well .   the   display   pads   are   lightly   different ,   but   better   than   losing   size   in   the   1.4   cu .   ft .   the   carousels   match   the   bosch   oven   door   design   remarkably ,   including   the   rounded   window   corners .   my   kitchen   looks   better   than   when   it   was   totally   new   with   this   addition .   knowing   that   these   two   new   appliances   are   untried   in   the   long   term ,   i   can   only   say   they   are   5   stars   as   week   old   additions   to   my   kitchen .   the   microwaves   do   everything   i   want   powerfully   and   quickly .   the   cost ,   especially   with   amazon   prime   shipping ,   closed   the   deal .
not   so   good .   i   have   also   had   the   handle   melt   and   the   display   has   failed   and   become   unreadable .
looks   pretty ,   but   function   is   so   so   it   looks   lovely   in   our   stainless   steel   kitchen ,   but   after   only   3   years   of   use ,   it   has   problems .   now   the   start   button   doesn   t   work ,   but   the   microwave   is   on   nonstop   whenever   the   door   is   closed .   started   very   suddenly .   will   have   to   get   it   serviced .   great   defrost ,   potato ,   popcorn   functions .
delighted   overall   for   the   price   i   don   t   think   you   can   beat   this   sharp   microwave .   i   just   wanted   a   basic   microwave   that   did   the   job .   i   was   replacing   a   countertop   micro   that   was   rated   at   1200   watts   and   i   was   concerned   that   the   rated   950   watts   of   the   sharp   would   be   inadequate .   my   fears   were   groundless   as   the   sharp   functions   every   bit   as   fast   the   older   one .   i   like   the   sleek   appearance   without   a   protruding   door   handle .   they   recommend   two   people   to   mount   this   oven ,   however   since   i   didn   t   have   help   available   i   was   able   to   easily   mount   it   myself   with   a   little   thought .   if   i   were   to   rate   it   down   for   anything   it   would   be   that   the   mounting   instructions   are   confusing   in   a   couple   of   areas ,   mainly   in   the   venting   info .   all   in   all   a   good   buy .
dangerous   i   feel   that   there   is   a   design   flaw   in   this   product .   the   sensor   reheat   button   it   just   below   the   stop   clear   button   and   very   easy   to   push   by   mistake .   this   very   thing   happened   to   our   microwave   oven   on   january   27   2008 ,   after   a   few   minutes   we   could   smell   burning   plastic ,   i   ran   into   the   kitchen   and   found   the   microwave   smoking   and   after   unplugging   the   unit   i   found   that   the   door   seal   had   a   melted   hole   in   it .   i   feel   that   an   automatic   feature   like   sensor   reheat   should   not   be   an   auto   destruct !   this   could   have   become   a   very   serious   situation   by   starting   a   fire   or   having   melted   plastic   stick   to   someone .   i   did   not   have   the   original   receipt   because   it   was   a   gift   in   2007   and   it   is   not   worth   paying   the   shipping   charge   to   send   it   back ,   i   wanted   to   inform   you   of   this   dangerous   condition .   we   have   replaced   the   microwave   with   another   sharp   r402jk   without   the   sensor   cook ,   we   have   always   liked   sharp   products   and   it   is   sad   that   this   unit   failed   to   live   up   to   the   sharp   reputation   from   sharp   minds   come   sharp   products   sharp   refused   to   honor   the   warranty   saying   that   it   was   a   consumer   fault   by   running   the   microwave   with   nothing   in   it .   i   feel   this   is   a   very   dangerous   flaw ,   you   can   just   lean   against   the   control   panel   and   the   unit   will   start   up   and   run   untill   it   melts .
sharp   over   the   range   convection   microwave   oven   you   will   be   surprised   at   the   amount   and   size   of   food   this   oven   will   accomodate .   it   cooks   everything   from   meatloaf   to   pound   cake   evenly   and   locking   in   juices .   i   bought   this   because   my   other   sharp   over   the   range   microwave   gave   up   after   eleven   years   of   constant   use .   i   was   used   to   the   sharp   features   which   made   it   the   logical   choice .   at   the   same   time ,   i   wanted   to   replace   my   conventional   oven   also   11   yrs .   old   because   it   never   baked   evenly .   with   the   sharp   micro   convection   combo ,   i   no   longer   have   to   replace   my   conventional   range   oven   i   ll   use   it   for   storage .
great   microwave   we   purchased   this   itme   for   a   family   member   for   christmas .   they   love   it .   said   its   the   best   microwave   they   ever   had .   they   love   the   one   touch   features   as   well   as   the   large   cooking   area .   would   recommend   if   you   want   a   dependable   and   spacious   microwave .
great   microwave !   i   highly   recommend   it !   i   bought   the   sharp   r   520ks   microwave   to   replace   my   old   white   westinghouse   that   stopped   working   after   thanksgiving .   i   did   alot   of   research   before   i   bought   this   one .   i   was   worried   i   wouldn   t   find   a   microwave   that   worked   as   well   as   my   last   one .   the   good   thing   is   that   i   could   finally   replace   my   white   microwave   with   stainless   steel   to   match   the   appliances   in   my   new   house .   now   i   had   an   excuse   to   replace   it .   i   was   looking   for   a   powerful   1200   watt   microwave   large   enough   to   fit   large   dishes   in ,   and   this   one   had   some   of   the   best   reviews ,   a   decent   price ,   and   the   stainless   steel   look   i   wanted .   i   also   needed   a   counter   top   model   since   i   have   no   under   cabinet   space   to   put   one .   this   microwave   works   great !   i   also   like   how   the   control   panel   doesn   t   have   elevated   buttons   making   it   easy   to   wipe   clean   with   no   chance   of   food   or   anything   getting   stuck   in   the   buttons .   it   has   some   nice   features   like   the   hot   water   button   you   tell   it   how   many   cups   to   heat   ,   minute   plus   button ,   keep   warm   setting ,   and   many   others .   i   ve   probably   used   the   hot   water   and   minute   plus   features   the   most .   there   are   sensor   heating   buttons ,   reheat   buttons ,   and   defrost   buttons ,   although   i   haven   t   had   a   chance   to   use   them   as   much   yet .   the   ones   i   have   used   so   far   work   great !   my   only   minor   complaint   is   the   same   as   everyone   else   s ,   the   buttons   all   look   the   same   and   the   start   minute   plus   button   and   stop   cancel   button   are   located   in   the   midst   of   all   the   other   buttons   making   it   difficult   to   distinguish   them   quickly .   not   too   much   of   an   issue ,   but   it   would   have   been   nice   if   those   features   were   located   on   the   bottom   or   the   corner   of   the   display   and   were   different   than   the   others .   it   wouldn   t   keep   me   from   purchasing   this   microwave   since   everything   else   is   great   and   i   m   sure   i   ll   get   used   to   them   soon .   the   microwave   is   also   pretty   large ,   so   you   can   fit   alot   in   there .   i   ve   heated   a   cup   of   water   and   a   dinner   sized   plate   of   food   at   the   same   time .   all   in   all ,   this   microwave   works   great ,   looks   great ,   and   was   reasonablypriced .   i   would   definitely   recommend   it   to   anyone   looking   for   a   nice   looking ,   powerful ,   counter   top   microwave .
terrific   use   it   every   day !   we   got   this   through   amazon   and   have   been   very   pleased .   i   do   recommend   that   you   open   the   box   and   inspect   immediately   upon   delivery ,   especially   if   it   is   during   the   holiday   season   when   shippers   use   a   lot   of   inexperienced   people .   our   first   unit   s   box   externally   seemed   fine   but   the   interior   packing   was   pulverized   and   the   unit   was   obviously   busted   up .   amazon   replaced   it   and   our   second   unit   is   still   running   strong .   i   love   this   i   could   write   a   tome .   the   convection   oven   not   only   bakes   and   roasts ,   but   setting   at   100   degrees ,   i   use   it   for   raising   bread ,   and   150   degrees ,   i   ll   bring   a   steak   or   roast   up   to   room   temp   before   searing   and   cooking .   i   think   at   150   degrees   it   s   faster   and   safer   than   having   it   sit   on   the   kitchen   counter   as   recommended   in   my   cookbooks .   i   m   a   better   cook !   one   warning   about   a   dual   use   appliance   like   this ,   which   should   be   obvious   when   you   are   using   it   for   one   thing   it   is   not   available   for   the   other .   i   wouldn   t   want   to   be   without   this   unit ,   but   i   also   have   another   microwave   and   i   feel   i   need   both .   i   would   say   i   use   the   two ,   in   tandem ,   nearly   every   evening .
sharp   r   1406   micrave   i   had   a   same   model   of   microwave   which   worked   for   me   about   4to   5   years   very   good   and   that   was   the   reason   i   ordered   the   same   brand   and   model   again   .   the   new   one   so   far   has   been   very   good   too   but   the   one   way   blocking   door   over   the   exhaust   fan   was   noisy   which   i   swapped   it   with   the   older   one   and   fixed   the   problem   overall   is   very   good   and   i   like   it .
works   great   this   was   a   great   buy ! !   i   read   the   other   reviews   and   they   are   right   on   the   money .   easy   to   put   up   but   it   goes   easer   with   two   people   but   one   can   do   it   and   everything   you   need   is   their   and   it   works   great .
turntable   plate   horrible   after   one   year   the   turntable   plate   cracked   while   we   were   making   a   bag   of   popcorn .   very   strange   indeed !   now   trying   to   find   a   replacement   as   i   really   miss   the   food   items   turning   while   cooking !   other   than   that   it   is   still   working   in   top   notch   condition .   br   br   update   this   microwave   died   after   only   2   years .   was   hoping   to   get   more   out   of   it   then   we   did .

best   microwave   oven   we   ve   ever   had !   earlier   sharp   microwaves   have   been   great ,   but   this   model   beats   the   others   we   ve   had   in   features   and   speed   and   this   newer   model   cost   a   lot   less .   we   haven   t   yet   used   all   the   features   this   microwave   affords ,   but   we   know   we   re   going   to   be   saving   a   lot   of   cooking   time
sharp   microwave   great   help   in   the   installation ,   smaller   oven   size   than   ge   or   sears .   display   could   have   larger   numbers .   no   handle   to   open   door .
wow ! ! ! ! ! ! !   this   oven   is   great .   it   ll   cook   anything   and   fast   too .   it   s   a   little   pricey   but   you   get   what   you   pay   for   most   of   the   time .   this   time   i   did .   stick   a   hot   dog ,   or   some   potaoes   or   bacon   in   there   and   push   the   right   number   and   presto   you   have   cooked   food .   we   had   baked   chicken   the   other   night   and   it   was   brown ,   done   and   tasty .   i   love   the   darn   thing .   i   give   it   a   high   five .
a   fine   microwave   at   a   fantastic   price   love   it !   love   it !   love   it !   my   sharp   microwave   of   10   years   finally   died .   it   had   survived   numerous   moves   and   the   door   was   actually   held   on   by   strapping   tape .   we   looked   around   at   other   microwaves   and   found   we   couldn   t   beat   the   price   for   all   the   features   offered   by   this   model   from .   this   one   was   built   with   the   same   quality   as   my   old   one   and   i   don   t   doubt   it   will   last   as   long .
great   looking   and   great   working   my   sharp   convection   over   the   range   mirowave   is   perfect .   other   brands   have   a   protruding   handle ,   could   hit   tall   people   in   the   face   the   handle   on   my   new   sharp   is   flush   and   much   more   stylish .   my   husband   installed   it ,   the   instructions   were   great .   sharp   has   designed   the   shipping   box   to   be   used   as   a   lifter   and   holder   to   assist   the   installer .   br   the   best   thing   was   the   excellant   service   from   amazon ,   and   i   saved   over   200 .   thank   you   amazon   and   sharp ! ! ! !
good   but   large   microwave   this   microwave   works   pretty   good .   the   sensor   cook   is   awesome   and   will   reheat   or   cook   items   almost   perfectly .   the   only   bad   thing   i   ve   seen   is   that   it   s   got   a   rather   large   footprint .
great   product   from   amazon   we   really   like   this   microwave   but   more   we   like   how   easy   it   was   to   get   it   from   amazon .   it   really   has   a   good   convection   oven ,   although   is   somewhat   noisy   with   the   fan .   it   was   very   easy   to   install   and   came   with   very   clear   instructions .   amazon   delivered   it   quickly   and   it   was   the   best   price   as   anywhere .
the   display   will   fail   i   have   had   two   of   these .   both   of   them   had   the   lcd   display   fail   and   the   plastic   buttons   crack ,   warp   and   other   wise   fail   as   well .
disappointed   i   purchased   my   r1510   two   years   ago .   in   the   first   year   i   had   to   have   unit   serviced   twice .   the   second   time ,   which   was   fortunately   two   weeks   before   warranty   expired ,   necessitated   a   new   replacement   unit .   well   here   i   am   a   year   later   with   same   failure   some   sort   of   a   lightning   storm   in   unit   with   no   warranty .   needless   to   say   i   will   be   looking   else   ware !
great   microwave   even   greater   amazon   service   this   is   a   great   microwave ,   especially   with   the   25   discount   amazon   is   offering   on   kitchen   purchases   over   125 .   but   let   me   tell   you   why   this   purchase   was   extra   special .   i   was   concerned   about   buying   a   microwave   that   had   to   be   delivered   size ,   weight ,   fragile ,   etc   rather   than   from   a   local   store   .   but   the   selection   at   local   stores   like   best   buy   was   so   bad ,   i   placed   the   order .   unfortunately ,   the   day   it   was   supposedly   delivered   by   ups ,   no   microwave   arrived .   i   called   ups   to   see   if   i   could   start   a   tracer ,   but   ups   told   me   that   amazon   had   to   start   the   tracer   because   they   sent   the   package .   i   went   to   the   customer   service   site ,   couldn   t   find   a   phone   number ,   and   used   the   e   mail   system .   i   thought   great   that   e   mail   will   disappear   into   the   ether ,   i   may   never   hear   from   anybody ,   and   here   i   am   without   my   microwave .   that   was   about   8pm   local   time   when   i   sent   the   e   mail .   br   br   the   next   morning   when   i   checked   my   e   mail ,   i   got   quite   a   surprise .   an   amazon   rep   wrote   back ,   apologized   my   package   had   been   lost ,   and   re   ordered   the   item   for   me .   before   too   long ,   i   had   an   e   mail   the   item   was   already   shipping   via   2   day   delivery ,   and   sure   enough ,   2   days   later   i   had   the   replacement   package .   wow !   no   hassle ,   no   waiting ,   just   great   service .   i   couldn   t   believe   it .   i   don   t   think   i   ll   ever   hesitate   when   i   want   to   order   something   from   amazon   again .   i   don   t   work   for   amazon ,   they   re   not   paying   for   this   i   ve   actually   never   written   a   product   review   before .   i   was   just   so   impressed   with   the   customer   service ,   i   had   to   write .   br   br   the   final   chapter   the   day   before   the   replacement   microwave   arrived ,   the   person   who   lives   in   the   next   cul   de   sac   over   from   us ,   with   the   same   house   number ,   and   with   a   street   name   similar   to   ours ,   showed   up   with   the   original   microwave   that   ups   had   mistakenly   delivered   to   them .   i   wrote   amazon   customer   service   an   e   mail ,   and   once   again   after   a   very   quick   response ,   i   was   able   to   arrange   for   ups   to   come   pick   up   the   extra   package .   thanks   amazon .   you   re   great .
good   deal ... works   great !   this   microwave   was   a   replacement   for   a   different   brand .   but   for   169   and   i   found   an   online   coupon   to   boot   it   was   worth   every   cent   spent .   granted ,   it   doesn   t   have   all   the   bells   and   whistles   my   old   microwave   had ,   but   what   do   we   generally   use   a   microwave   for ... reheating ,   defrosting   and   popcorn ... so   why   spend   the   extra   cash   br   br   installation   was   not   quite   so   easy   as   others   indicated   as   i   was   replacing   a   different   brand ,   which   meant   drilling   new   holes   in   cabinet ,   and   installing   a   new   bracket   behind   the   microwave ,   but   still ,   for   the   money   saved ,   well   worth   the   effort .   it   does   not   come   with   a   charcoal   filter   so   be   prepared   to   buy   one   separately   if   you   are   going   ventless   do   it   at   the   time   of   purchase   if   you   can   find   it   on   amazon   so   you   can   save   the   shipping   cost   .   br   br   the   rating   i   gave   is   due   to   the   lack   of   features ... basic   microwave   with   few   extras ,   but   the   price   made   it   4   stars !   br   br   br   br   br  
over   the   range   sharp   convection   microwave   oven   i   love   it .   the   only   problem   is   the   popcorn   button   is   not   set   long   enough   to   complete   popping   the   popcorn .   it   is   only   half   cooked .   the   convection   works   great   and   much   simpler   than   my   previous   combination   convection   microwave   oven
great   microwave   for   the   money   doesn   t   have   all   the   bells   and   whistles   as   my   last   sharp   over   the   range   microwave ,   but   it   works   for   me .   turntable   has   no   on   off   button ,   so   it   is   always   on ,   inside   is   a   little   smaller   width   wise ,   but   still   fits   13x9x2   pan   ok .   paid   169 ,   free   shipping   and   no   tax .   great   deal .
top   notch   price ,   delivery ,   quality !   i   was   a   bit   put   off   by   other   reviews   critical   of   packaging ,   delivery ,   installation   problems ,   and   quality .   in   my   case   at   least ,   amazon   and   sharp   scored   100   in   all   categories .   i   do   find   that   a   small   hydraulic   jack   helps   immeasurably   when   single   handedly   positioning   the   unit   during   installation .   and   the   manual   was   misleading   regarding   exhaust   fan   orientation .   it   s   often   the   case   that   manual   updates   lag   product   improvements .

it   was   a   bit   of   a   disappointment   when   we   were   remodeling   our   kitchen   we   decided   to   replace   our   sharp   countertop   convection   microwave   with   the   over   the   range   model .   i   really   miss   the   old   one .   this   new   model   seems   to   be   a   lot   noisier   than   the   old   one .   i   went   from   1.5   cubic   feet   down   to   1.1   and   it   feels   like   i   lost   a   lot   more   room   than   that .   the   hood   light   is   very   dim   and   the   replacement   bulbs   2   each   cost   at   least   4   a   piece   if   you   can   find   them .   because   we   had   to   vent   this   into   the   kitchen   we   had   to   sent   away   to   sharp   for   a   charcoal   filter   that   cost   20   filter   plus   shipping   and   handling .   we   had   planned   to   vent   it   to   the   outside   but   the   vent   didn   t   even   come   close   to   matching   up   the   hole   from   our   former   range   hood .   the   cooking   turntable   is   white   and   very   had   to   keep   clean .   it   is   only   a   month   old   and   is   very   stained   already .   br   i   do   like   to   have   the   cooking   area   at   eye   level .   br   i   researched   the   price   for   comparable   items   on   the   web   before   buying   and   amazon   offered   the   best   price   as   well   as   free   shipping .   i   am   very   pleased   with   amazon !
bargain   mind   the   interior !   one   week   after   installing   this   over   the   stove ,   convection   microwave ,   the   stainless   steel   interior   began   to   look   spotted .   a   white   cloth   rubbed   on   the   area   revealed   rust   which   continued   growing   like   a   severe   rash   on   all   surfaces   of   the   inside .   sharp   authorized   a   local   service   rep   to   make   a   housecall   and   examine   it .   he   concluded   the   metal   interior   s   defect ,   whereupon   sharp   said   they   would   replace   but   not   pay   for   reinstallation   of   the   unit .   removing   the   defective   microwave   and   reinstalling   will   cost   me   140 ! ! !   that   wipes   out   any   savings   incurred   by   ordering   online .   sharp   s   customer   service   will   not   compensate .   i   would   have   been   much   better   off   buying   from   my   local   retailer   who   would   have   changed   out   the   piece   without   charge   in   a   situation   like   this .   live   and   learn .   it   is   more   than   one   month   after   the   inspection   and   i   have   not   received   the   replacement   said   to   be   on   back   order   but   still   available   online ! ! !   .   br   aside   from   the   interior   cosmetic   defect ,   the   microwave   looks   great   and   works   fine .
shipping   of   this   unit   i   see   many   disgruntled   people   who   have   had   shipping   problems .   sharp   does   not   put   enough   packing   materials   in   the   box   to   ship   these   via   post   office   or   ups .   at   85   lbs   the   seller   needs   to   double   box   these   and   add   more   packing   material   and   then   send   via   fed   ex   or   dhl   at   a   higher   ground   rate   and   customer   will   be   fine .   thanks   br   thecloseoutking
sharp .. no   customer   service !   i   ordered   one   of   these   on   line .   it   came   in   promptly .   i   found   that   it   was   bent   on   the   bottom ,   bent   on   a   piece   of   stainless   steel   across   the   front   and   the   vent   damper   that   came   inside   the   oven   was   damaged .   this   appeared   to   be   a   factory   sealed   unit .   br   it   had   to   come   from   the   factory   like   this .   possible   the   bottom   was   bent   somewhere   in   shipment   ranging   from   the   factory   to   the   shipper .   since   i   got   it   on   friday ,   i   went   ahead   an   installed   it   thinking   that   sharp   would   simply   send   me   the   parts   as   they   were   screw   on   simple   replacement   parts .   i   was   wrong .   first   sharp   said   they   did   not   warrant   cosmetic   damage .   i   told   them   it   was   factory   shipped   that   way ,   please   send   parts .   they   said   no !   ship   it   back   to   who   i   bought   it   from .   i ,   after   much   argument ,   had   to   take   it   down   and   send   it   back .   this   ended   up   costing   the   seller   shipping   charges   which   they   paid .   i   felt   this   was   not   right   as   sharp   could   have   easily   fixed   the   problem .   the   shipper   did   not   have   another   unit   in   stock ,   so   i   got   a   refund   and   ended   up   buying   another   brand   locally .   the   foam   in   bottom   of   carton   was   very   thin   none   in   middle   ,   thus ,   subjecting   the   unit   to   shipping   damage .   i   had   a   sharp   before   this   one   that   never   gave   any   real   problems ,   but   their   customer   service   really   sucks !   br   br   my   advise   to   you   is   to   carefully   check   any   microwave   oven   you   buy   before   you   leave   the   store   or   install   it .   apparently   the   factories   in   usa   or   korea   do   not   do   this   before   they   ship   them .   br   i   finally   got   my   replacement   oven   installed ,   but   it   was   the   third   unit   to   get   one   that   was   not   bent   right   out   of   the   box .
disastrous   design .   it   may   look   pretty ,   but   as   an   over   the   range   microwave   oven   it   provides   nothing   but   headaches .   even   a   modest   amount   of   heat   from   the   cook   top   below   causes   the   microwave   oven   s   pushbutton   door   latch   to   deform   melt   because   sharp   chose   to   save   money   with   plastic   rather   than   metal   interior   parts .   thus ,   either   the   door   won   t   close   or   one   has   to   pry   the   latch   open   each   time .   the   service   technician   who   replaced   the   assembly   twice   said   he   had   performed   almost   a   dozen   similar   replacements   in   the   recent   past .   br   br   my   advice ,   buy   it   only   if   you   never   plan   to   use   the   cook   top   below .   br  
a   great ,   sleek   oven ...   if   you   can   get   an   undamaged   one .   we   ordered   one   of   these   and   were   shipped   an   open   box   customer   return .   the   bottom   of   the   unit   was   dented   and   the   interior   was   dented .   it   made   a   humming   vibrating   noise   during   microwave   operations .   br   amazon   shipped   us   another   unit   which   also   was   an   obvious   open   box   damaged   customer   return .   looks   like   people   are   dropping   these   during   the   install ,   then   returning   and   the   factory   warehouse   people   aren   t   even   refurbishing   them .   it   was   easy   to   tell   it   was   already   used   since   the   exhaust   vent   was   not   set   to   the   factory   default   of   recirculating .   br   it   isn   t   amazon   s   fault ,   in   fact   they   were   so   quick   to   ship   another   unit   2nd   day   fedex !   .   i   wonder   if   other   vendors   are   seeing   this   problem ...   i   love   the   way   this   looks   over   my   stove ,   but   it   looks   like   they   wont   be   sending   another   one   due   to   the   problems   with   the   warehouse .
what   happened   to   sharp   quality   i   do   not   have   this   particular   microwave   though   i   do   have   a   sharp   1100   carousel   and   feel   compelled   to   comment .   originally   i   had   another   sharp   model .   after   about   six   mos .   the   door   would   not   close   properly .   with   a   little   shoving   you   could   get   it   to   operate   but   i   found   that   a   bit   alarming .   walmart   where   we   puchased   let   us   exchange   it   for   the   above   model .   after   less   than   a   year   a   couple   of   the   keypad   numbers   do   not   function   i   have   to   choose   another   number .   it   s   such   a   shame   that   what   you   thought   was   a   quality   product   you   could   depend   on   is   no   longer .
great   microwave ,   little   tough   to   mount   its   a   pretty   big   and   heavy   unit   so   having   someone   around   to   help   mount   would   be   a   good   thing .   i   found   that   sometimes   the   clips   in   the   back   have   a   little   trouble   popping   in   all   the   way ,   unless   its   lined   up   just   right .   br   i   didnt   like   the   wall   mount   screws   a   whole   lot   as   well   as   the   fact   there   is   only   4   to   hold   on   the   whole   bracket   they   note   that   you   should   have   at   least   2   in   studs   .   they   have   holes   drilled   in   the   mount   all   the   way   across ,   so   what   i   did   was   located   two   studs ,   drilled   some   1   16th   pilot   holes   in   the   bracket   where   they   were   and   sunk   5   1   3   4   quot   drywall   screws   in   each   stud   from   top   to   bottom   of   the   bracket   to   attach   it   to   the   wall .   i   didnt   want   to   worry   about   the   microwave   falling   off   and   either   seriously   injuring   someone   or   smashing   my   new   ceramic   top   stove .   br   also   be   careful   if   drilling   the   top   cabinet   mount   holes   with   the   microwave   in   place ,   the   bit   can   easily   destroy   the   screw   hole   i   ended   up   replacing   the   two   small   upper   cabinet   mount   screws   with   1   2   quot   self   tapping   bolts .   so   the   cinnimon   powder   doesnt   quite   sit   level   up   there   in   the   cupboard ..   but   the   microwave   is   definately   not   falling   out   of   my   wall !   br   as   for   functionality ,   the   microwave   is   nice   and   powerful ,   the   unsightly   buttons   are   hidden   behind   the   door   you   punch   in   the   settings   when   you   open   it   .   a   note   of   caution ,   dont   put   anything   in   it   without   the   carousel   tray   to   heat .   i   had   a   small   paper   nacho   bowl   in   there   and   it   almost   started   the   glue   on   fire   in   20   seconds .   br   another   note ...   the   carousel   tray   does   not   ship   in   this   box   well ,   mine   arrived   broken   in   half .   my   only   option   was   to   ship   the   whole   unit   back   weighs   like   80   lbs   .   i   lucked   out   because   my   old   microwave   was   a   sharp   and   the   carousel   tray   is   identical .
sharp   could   be   sharper   update   yes   i   too   had   the   door   latch   button   melt   and   it   does   not   function   any   longer   it   actually   was   replaced   within   the   1st   year   under   warranty   but   now   this   has   happened   again   a   second   time   and   i   was   only   boiling   water   on   the   front   burner ,   i   see   no   use   in   paying   for   a   second   repair   since   i   am   currently   using   a   pen   to   pop   the   door   open   i   will   of   course   have   to   replace   the   whole   microwave   in   the   near   future   i   will   be   soooo   happy   when   i   finally   do   i   can   t   wait   to   ditch   this   appliance   what   a   waste .   next   time   i   m   choosing   a   regular   handle   not   a   push   button   latch .   live   learn   don   t   they   test   these   designs   in   practical   applications   before   releasing   them   to   the   consumer ..... won   t   be   buying   anything   from   sharp   company   any   time   soon .   i   purchased   this   microwave   to   replace   a   countertop   model   emerson   proffesional   stainless   steel ,   i   needed   a   spacesaving   feature   plus   vent   for   stove   and   wanted   stainless   steel   to   match   my   other   stainless   steel   appliances .   i   purchased   it   from   amazon   for   275 .   lowest   price   i   could   find   and   am   currently   waiting   on   a   30 . rebate   from   sharp   so   for   the   price   its   not   a   bad   deal .   it   has   no   handle   that   makes   it   sleek   looking   and   the   control   panel   is   hidden   behind   the   door   not   used   to   having   to   set   controls   before   closing   door   but   it   makes   cleaning   easier .   my   countertop   model   was   of   higher   quality   stainless   steel   and   i   only   paid   100 .   for   it   on   all   sides   not   just   the   front   like   this   model   i   installed   this   unit   to   vent   vertically   outside   the   damper   is   a   bit   flimsy   but   hopefully   its   been   tested   by   sharp   for   reliability .   exhaust   fan   unit   detects   heat   from   stove   and   automatically   operates ,   unit   is   a   bit   noisy   on   either   hi   or   low   setting , wish   it   was   quieter . the   light   has   hi   and   low   settings   either   is   bright   enough ,   more   of   a   night   light   feature .   overall   it   work   fine   and   looks   good .   not   a   high   end   unit   but   then   again   not   a   high   end   price .   it   does   have   a   nice   feature   that   senses   when   your   food   is   cooked ,   used   it   on   potatoes   which   turned   out   great . at   first   i   was   reluctant   to   purchase   this   larger   appliance   that   would   be   shipped   through   ups   for   fear   it   would   arrive   damaged   but   ups   did   a   fine   job   with   handling .   rated   it   3   stars   as   unit   being   average   and   appearance   bearing   clean   lines   which   boosted   my   rating .
american   made   microwave   w   convection   works   great   i   purchased   this   item   for   two   reasons ,   1   because   this   is   a   union   made   microwave   assembled   in   tn   the   only   american   made   microwave   i   ve   found   and   2   it   has   a   convection   oven   that   can   double   as   a   2nd   oven .   br   the   styling   on   this   unit   is   very   nice ,   sleek   and   not   overcomplicated ,   it   enhances   the   look   of   my   kitchen .   br   the   microwave   cooking   is   simple ,   with   built   in   functions   for   thawing   frozen   items   or   popping   popcorn ,   etc .   you   punch   a   button ,   it   asks   you   how   many   steaks   you   are   defrosting   or   how   much   popcorn   you   are   popping   and   it   does   the   rest .   br   convection   cooking   is   new   to   me ,   but   the   manual   and   recipe   booklet   that   come   with   the   unit   have   already   produced   salmon   steaks   with   a   white   wine   basil   sauce   and   cooked   a   pizza .   i   ve   found   that   in   the   heat   of   the   summer   i   can   use   this   oven   vs .   my   gas   oven   and   it   cooks   faster   and   doesn   t   heat   up   the   house   as   much .   there   is   also   a   function   that   combines   microwave   and   convection   cooking   to   get   meals   done   even   faster ...   there   are   so   many   things   this   machine   does ,   i   ve   yet   to   figure   them   all   out .   br   a   nice   feature ,   you   can   turn   the   turntable   on   off   depending   on   whether   you   have   a   round   or   rectangular   dish .   br   the   unit   runs   on   regular   110   voltage ,   so   no   complicated   rewiring .   br   ge ,   kenmore   and   samsung   all   have   similar   units   all   made   in   korea ,   all   for   the   same   price   or   more .   i   chose   this   microwave   because   i   was   tired   of   complaining   about   outsourcing   of   american   jobs   and   wanted   to   support   a   company   like   sharp   that   is   still   making   some   of   their   units   here   in   the   usa .
