met   expectations   i   did   considerable   research   before   choosing   the   andis   rc   2   ionic   1875w   ceramic   hair   dryer   for   my   wife .   she   wanted   a   dryer   that   was   easy   to   store   and   that   would   dry   her   hair   quickly .   so   far   it   meets   all   of   her   expectations   and   we   re   very   satisfied .   we   are   being   careful   with   the   retractable   cord   as   others   have   suggested .
i   ve   been   a   hair   stylist   for   10   years   and   this   brand   of   hair   dryer   has   been   the   best .   i   give   it   4   stars   for   everything   but   it   is   heavy ,   that   is   the   only   down   side .   br   br   i   ve   used   this   brand   since   my   beauty   school   days ,   from   salon   work   to   freelance   studio   works ,   i   ve   found   this   brand   to   be   the   best .   the   brand   has   yet   to   fail   me .   it   continues   to   be   the   most   popular   salon   brand   among   the   stylist .
best   ever !   this   blow   dryer   was   purchased   to   replace   a   similar   one ....... just   love   the   fact   that   the   cord   retracts !   it   s   not   cumbersome ,   has   two   speeds   and   a   cooling   option .   terrific   value   for   the   money .
satisfied ! ! !   as   a   cosmetologist ,   we   all   need   a   professional   blower ,   shipped   a   lot   sooner   than   what   i   expected   and   worked   perfectly   fine .   brand   new   product .
wall   hair   dryer   great   product ! !   although ,   it   has   only   2   temps   low   and   high ,   which   is   not   really   too   hot   at   all .   i   would   ve   preferred   a   medium   in   there ,   and   then   br   a   hotter   temp   for   high ...   but ,   all   in   all ,   this   product   is   perfect   for   me .   my   hair   is   thin .  
fast   and   professional   i   would   order   with   them   again   for   sure .   package   arrived   in   a   timely   fashion .   love   the   product .   professional   correspondence   with   them .

not   so   happy   with   it   it   could   have   been   better   for   the   price .   it   keeps   burning   my   hair   occasionally ,   a   problem   i   never   had   with   the   previous   dryers .   i   dont   like   it   for   that   reason   but   otherwise   it   is   fine .   i   bought   a   different   dryer   for   primary   use   now .   this   is   just   for   emergency   use .
just   get   it   i   just   love   it .   i   was   looking   for   a   professional   hair   dryer   for   styling   and   it   s   exactly   what   i   was   looking   for .   the   heat   is   just   perfect   and   it   keeps   the   hair   shiny .

works   amazing   this   product   works   really   good   and   the   price   is   reasonable .   i   strongly   recommanded .   br   i   will   say   this   might   be   the   best   choice   for   product   in   this   price   range .
awesome !   this   is   an   amazingly   sturdy   and   powerful   hair   dryer .   really   dries   my   hair   quickly   and   allows   for   easy   styling .   this   one   should   last   me   a   long   time .
love !   love   this .   it   s   light   weight   which   is   nice   and   easy   to   use .   i   have   a   lot   of   hair ,   and   it   dries   so   fast   with   this   hair   dryer !   would   def   recommend   it !
not   recommended   for   curly   hair   i   have   wavy   curly   hair   and   use   a   diffuser   everyday   so   not   to   break   up   my   curls ...   this   hairdryer   was   actually   too   powerful   even   on   the   lowest   setting   for   my   delicate   curls .   if   i   was   going   to   blow   it   straight   i   m   sure   it   would   have   cut   my   drying   time   but   for   my   type   of   loose   curls ,   i   needed   the   diffuser   to   diffuse   more   it   felt   like   the   diffuser   wasn   t   holding   back   any   of   the   air   and   the   air   not   to   be   so   powerful   on   low   .   i   ended   up   returning   this   hairdryer   and   going   back   to   my   original   lightweight   revlon .   i   wouldn   t   recommend   this   dryer   to   someone   with   fragile   lightweight   curls   but   i   would   recommend   for   everyone   else .
powerful   hair   dryer   i   have   very   thick   hair   that   is   difficult   to   dry .   this   hair   dryer   is   powerful   and   dries   my   hair   quickly   and   easily .   i   love   it .
marketing   gimmick   this   dryer   costs   and   weighs   twice   as   much   as   my   good   old   conair   dryer   that   lasted   me   15   years ,   but   works   no   better .   i   wish   i   bought   something   else .   it   is   bulky ,   heavy   and   slow .   not   sure   why   does   the   maker   claim   that   the   hair   becomes   shiny   and   silky   because   of   their   dryer .   mine   did   not   get   better   a   single   bit .   br   br   update   5   months   later   it   slowed   down   substantially   after   5   months   in   service .
great   hair   dryer   this   replaced   a   hairdryer   that   s   oh ,   about   25   years   old   and   still   working .   gotta   say ,   it   s   a   welcome   change .   love   the   ionic   aspect ,   and   it   leaves   my   hair   very   manageable .   powerful   but   quiet   motor .   other   reviewers   have   commented   that   it   has   a   funny   smell .   i   can   t   say   i   ve   noticed ,   and   there   s   never   any   reason   to   blow   it   in   my   face ,   so   not   a   problem .   love   the   soft   feel   of   the   housing ,   love   the   little   rubber   bumper   that   doesn   t   allow   it   to   slide   on   the   countertop ,   love   the   long   cord   ...   maybe   i   ll   get   25   years   out   of   this   one ,   too !
perfect   for   my   hair !   this   little   hair   dryer   really   does   the   trick !   i   will   admit   for   those   with   a   thick   head   of   hair   this   may   not   be   the   best   option ,   but   for   me ,   with   my   long ,   thin   and   falling   out   hair   its   perfect .   it   doesn   t   get   super   hot   which   is   good   because   my   hair   is   easily   damaged   so   having   a   hair   dryer   that   does   not   scorch   my   hair   is   a   plus .   i   have   not   owned   a   hair   dryer   for   the   last   10   years   but   i   was   told   that   by   blow   drying   my   hair   it   will   help   natural   oils   come   out   that   air   drying   doesn   t   release   and   so   far   i   am   very   happy   with   the   product .   it   comes   with   a   diffuser   and   other   small   attachment   as   well .   i   love   it !
does   not   have   cool   shot   button   the   product   info   here   is   incorrect .   there   is   no   cool   shot   button   on   this   thing .   br   br   the   product   info   here   is   incorrect .   there   is   no   cool   shot   button   on   this   thing .
ok   but   could   be   stronger   i   thought   it   would   be   stronger .   i   even   leave   turbo   option   on   all   of   the   time ,   but   my   older ,   cheaper   hairdryer   definitely   dried   quicker .   i   do   like   the   attachments   though   diffuser ,   concentrator   .   it   is   heavier   like   i   have   read   before   buying ,   and   the   cord   must   be   shorter   because   it   gets   pulled   out   of   the   wall   by   accicent   at   least   once   with   every   use .   unfortunately ,   i   wouldn   t   recommend .
great   for   everyday   travel   initially   purchased   this   for   traveling   since   it   has   the   ability   to   work   with   european   voltage   as   well   as   us .   i   now   use   it   every   day .   its   light   and   powerful .   highly   recommend .
awesome   for   the   price   my   hair   dryer   broke   a   while   ago   and   i   finally   decided   to   replace   it   with   this   one .   i   found   it   at   walmart   for   35 ,   which   wasn   t   the   most   expensive   one   that   they   had ,   but   i   ve   used   john   frieda   products   before   so   i   figured   it   would   be   a   good   try .   so   far ,   i   really   like   this   dryer .   it   feels   like   it   could   be   a   lot   more   expensive .   br   i   compared   it   to   my   mother   s   80   or   so   hairdryer   and   it   actually   keeps   up   with   it   pretty   well .   i   really   like   how   the   engine   feels   and   sounds .   it   works   pretty   quiet   and   has   a   low   hum   rather   than   the   high   pitched   noise   a   lot   of   cheap   o   hairdryers   have .   it   doesn   t   shoot   the   air   quite   as   fast   and   it   doesn   t   get   quite   as   hot   as   the   80   blowdryer   my   mom   has ,   but   it   s   pretty   great   at   it   s   job   because   my   hair   actually   looks   better   when   i   use   this   hairdryer   vs   the   more   expensive   one .   it   definitely   fights   frizz   very   well .   br   the   only   problem   i   d   say   i   have   with   it   is   that   it   s   a   heavier   dryer   than   my   old   one   that   broke .   i   say   problem   because   people   may   dislike   that   but   i   prefer   it   that   way .   when   dryers   have   a   bit   of   weight   to   them   i   feel   like   they   ve   got   a   stronger   motor .   not   to   mention   i   really   don   t   notice   when   i   m   using   it .   br   as   for   the   people   complaining   about   the   buttons ,   i   can   t   say   that   i   can   relate .   i   guess   i   have   very   small   hands   so   i   can   hold   the   dryer   pretty   well   without   messing   with   the   buttons   too   badly ,   but   so   far   every   blow   dryer   i   ve   seen   has   the   buttons   on   the   side   pannel   like   that ,   i   think   you   just   have   to   get   used   to   it .   br   overall ,   awesome   dryer .   i   m   very   happy   i   purchased   it .
large   and   capable   the   mangroomer   is   a   large   yet   lightweight   dryer   that   provides   quiet   and   powerful   hair   drying   action .   even   my   wife   s   thick   and   long   hair   is   dried   within   minutes .   the   size   of   the   hair   dryer   means   it   is   not   meant   for   travel ,   but   rather   one   that   should   stay   at   home .   the   cord   length   is   appropriate   and   does   not   interfere   with   my   morning   routine   of   getting   ready   and   singing   along   to   katy   perry   in   the   mirror   and   imagining   myself   at   madison   square   garden .
buy   it !   works   very   good .   i   m   and   african   american   with   permed   hair .   now   ladies   you   know   after   we   wash   and   blow   dry   our   hair   we   normally   have   to   flat   iron   it   as   well .   but   that   s   not   the   case   with   this   blow   dryer   since   i   started   using   it   i   haven   t   flat   ironed   my   hair .   i   just   blow   dry   and   i   m   out   the   door .   i   once   told   my   cousin   this   and   she   said   i   looked   like   i   when   to   the   hair   dresser .   product   works   great .   and   drying   and   combing   with   one   hand   is   absolutely   awesome .   the   combs   snap   only   firmly .   i   have   no   fear   it   will   fall   off   even   with   my   thick   hair .
favorite   hairdryer ,   but   doesn   t   last   this   hairdryer   is   quieter   than   most   and   works   great .   i   owned   three ,   but   that   was   the   problem .   i   purchased   it   three   times   because   i   loved   it   so   much .   however ,   each   hairdryer   lasted   less   than   a   year ,   and   i   used   it   probably   four   times   per   week .   i   was   very   disappointed   in   what   seemed   to   be   a   great   hairdryer   of   poor   quality   in   that   was   unable   to   last .   sad   to   have   to   switch   to   something   more   reliable !
gets   the   job   done   this   is   my   first   hair   dryer   purchase   in   many   years   because   i   had   curly   hair ,   which   i   am   now   straightening .   br   br   pros   dries   hair   quickly   i   was   using   it   on   high   for   the   first   few   weeks ,   but   today   i   set   the   temperature   to   medium   and   my   hair   still   dried   fairly   quickly   ,   cute   color ,   retractable   cord ,   quick   cool   button ,   price   br   cons   it   seemed   a   bit   heavy   on   the   first   day ,   but   i   got   over   that   quickly   br   br   i   would   recommend   this   product .
turbo   great   for   thick   hair   this   works   awesome !   great   or   long   thick   hair .   i   love   the   speed   and   the   cooling   feature   actually   works ,   others   that   ive   had   do   not   really   feel   cooler .. this   works   great   for   a   finished   look .
awesome   for   thick   hair   was   looking   for   a   blow   dryer   that   would   dry   my   thick   hair   in   under   45   minutes   and   i   found   it .   definitely   not   for   thin   hair .   br   br   this   is   exactly   what   i   was   looking   for .
powerful   little   travel   buddy   straightforward ,   not   fancy ,   but   powerful   to   handle   my   moisture   soaked   hair   quickly .   worth   the   price   and   so   far   is   sturdy   and   works   beautifully .   lightweight   so   styling   is   easy   and   the   dryer   is   easy   to   handle .
lame   this   is   a   lame   hair   drier .   take   a   long   time   to   dry   my   hair   has   no   power .   the   settings   dont   function   correctly   either .   br   don   t   cheap   out   you   get   what   you   pay   for   in   this   case .
very   nice   i   like   this   dryer .   it   works   well   and   i   like   the   night   light   as   well .   it   works   well   for   a   small   bathroom .
rubber   fingertips   on   diffuser   broke   off   immediately .   i   have   thicker ,   curly   hair ,   so   my   stylist   recommended   i   get   a   blow   dryer   with   a   diffuser   attachment .   i   got   this   dryer   3   weeks   ago ,   and   have   been   using   the   diffuser   attachment ,   and   kept   noticing   little   black   things   on   the   bathroom   floor .   then   i   realized   they   were   the   rubber   fingertips   from   the   attachment .   more   than   half   of   them   are   broken   off .   i   don   t   use   the   attachment   aggressively ,   and   have   not   dropped   it   on   the   floor .   i   m   really   disappointed   it   was   such   poor   quality   it   didn   t   even   last   a   month .   now   i   ll   have   to   buy   a   new   blow   dryer ,   because   without   the   diffuser   attachment ,   it   s   useless   to   me .   and   buying   a   new   attachment   with   shipping   is   as   much   as   a   new   dryer .   bad   job ,   conair ! ! !
easy   to   use   good   results   at   present ,   i   am   using   this   hair   dryer   at   home .   i   like   it   so   much   that   i   am   going   to   buy   another   one   for   my   travel   bag .   when   i   visit   family   and   friends   i   like   to   bring   my   own   hair   dryer   so   i   keep   one   packed   in   my   suitcase .   br   this   hair   dryer   is   light   and   powerful .   my   hair   looks   better   than   it   did   when   i   used   my   previous   dryer   shinier   and   easy   to   manage .
not   for   salon   use   i   was   excited   about   getting   this   dryer   after   reading   the   reviews .   ive   been   a   hairdresser   for   12   years   so   unfortunally   i   have   carpal   tunnel .   this   blowdryer   is   heavier   than   it   says   and   it   is   very   loud .   at   home   use   would   be   ok   but   in   salon   use .... not   so   much .   i   actually   returned   this   dryer   to   amazon .
not   exactly   as   pictured   what   is   not   immediately   discernible   from   the   supplied   photos   is   that   the   intake   bezel   and   control   buttons   are   all   molded   in   bright   pink   pearl   colored   plastic .   that ,   and   the   fact   that   the   box   is   printed   in   a   all   over   floral   pattern   tells   me   that   this   item   is   targeted   toward   the   women   s   market .   i   ended   up   returning   it .
works   fine   i   have   only   used   this   dryer   once ,   but   it   works   very   well .   my   hair   is   fine   so   it   doesn   t   take   long   to   dry   so   this   dryer   does   the   job   quickly .   all   in   all ,   i   m   pleased   with   this   purchase   and   would   recommend   it   to   others .
misrepresented   it   is   not   small   for   traveling   purposes   i   feel   that   this   product   was   misrepresented   since   it   was   listed   in   the   travel   dryers .   it   is   the   size   of   any   large   dryer   and   i   needed   a   dryer   for   traveling   that   was   compact   to   fit   into   a   small   case .   it   had   all   the   requirements   i   wanted   except   way   too   large .   i   have   two   large   ones   already .   br   it   was   not   compact   that   was   my   only   complaint .   i   sent   it   back   of   course .

good   hair   dryer   this   hair   dryer   does   the   job .   i   wanted   a   small   dryer   with   multiple   heat   settings   and   that   is   what   i   got .   i   knew   it   had   1600   watts   when   i   ordered   it ,   i   wish   it   was   a   little   bit   more   powerful .   great   for   a   mans   short   hair .   for   a   woman   with   long   thick   hair   you   may   want   something   with   more   watts .   i   have   only   had   the   dryer   for   several   weeks .   so   far   no   quality   issues .   the   guarantee   on   the   box   states   5   years .   we   will   see .   the   price   is   so   low   for   what   you   get   if   i   get   2   years   out   of   it   i   will   be   happy .
disappointed   i   was   disappointed   with   this   blow   dryer .   after   reading   the   good   reviews   about   it ,   i   thought   it   would   be   a   safe   purchase .   wrong .   first   the   hardware   to   mount   it   to   the   wall   is   flimsy   and   hard   to   work   with .   tiny   little   screws .   second   it   is   very   underpowered .   the   best   thing   about   it   is   the   nightlight .   bright   enough   so   you   don   t   have   to   turn   another   bathroom   light   on   in   the   middle   of   the   night .   i   did   get   2   of   them   and   they   were   on   sale   at   the   time   so   i   kept   them .   i   won   t   buy   one   of   their   products   again .
professional   quality ,   loving   it   i   purchased   the   black   one   via   amazon   and   i   am   very   pleased   with   the   product   so   far .   i   ve   always   wanted   a   simple   solution   to   great   hair   and   this   is   exactly   it .   i   used   to   own   a   conair   from   the   drug   store   and   this   sedu   has   changed   my   perspective   on   hair   dryers .   i   ve   always   thought   that   i   can   never   re   produce   the   kind   of   blow   out   that   i   get   from   salons   but   this   hair   dryer   has   made   it   possible .   the   air   is   pretty   strong   and   i   don   t   find   the   hair   dryer   heat   up   more   than   my   drug   store   one .   it   does   take   most   of   the   frizz   away   and   my   hair   stays   in   a   nice   curve   for   the   whole   day   when   i   use   a   round   brush .   br   br   to   be   fair   though ,   this   hair   dryer   more   expensive   so   you   would   expect   the   higher   quality   to   match   the   price   tag .   another   thing   i   found   is   that   it   s   actually   kinda   heavy   for   its   size .   my   old   one   is   bigger   but   actually   weight   about   the   same   as   this   one ,   maybe   even   less .   if   you   are   looking   for   a   feather   weight ,   maybe   this   is   not   for   you .   other   than   that ,   i   have   no   complaints .   br   br   loving   it   so   far !
light ,   easy   to   pack ,   and   dual   voltage   but   became   a   problem   i   spotted   this   in   the   target   luggage   section   for   about   the   same   price   and   loved   it   at   first   sight   and   had   to   have   it ! ! ! !   it   s   the   tiniest   dryer   i   ve   ever   seen ! ! !   it   almost   fits   in   the   palm   of   my   hand .   folded ,   it   s   4   5   inches   long   not   counting   the   cord   .   i   ve   been   using   it   for   about   a   week   now   just   to   test   it   out   before   my   trip   abroad   and   it   s   surprisingly   very   strong .   no   weird   smells   as   someone   else   mentioned   maybe   their   particular   product   has   an   issue .   so   far   mine   is   working   great .   my   hair   is   shorter   so   i   m   not   worried   about   how   long   it   will   take ,   but   this   thing   is   pretty   strong .   i   m   done   in   minutes .   the   other   great   thing   is   that   it   has   34   dual   voltage .   34   i   had   to   read   up   on   this   because   i   haven   t   traveled   in   a   while   and   i   guess   a   whole   lot   of   electronics   and   stuff   like   this   is   made   dual   voltage   today   so   check   your   product   and   educate   yourself .   just   look   at   this   hair   dryer ,   for   example ,   and   it   will   say   125v   250v   on   the   handle .   this   means   it   will   work   anywhere   where   the   voltage   falls   in   that   range ...   most   if   not   all   of   the   world .   but   you   will   need   an   adapter   when   going   abroad   with   this .   so   here   is   the   tricky   part   if   this   stuff   is   new   for   you ,   too ...   you   don   t   need   a   converter   more   expensive   for   anything   that   s   dual   voltage ,   just   an   adapter .   the   adapter   is   just   the   little   plug   part   that   goes   into   the   wall   so   you   can   plug   it   in .   the   converter   is   usually   bigger   and   box   like   and   more   expensive .   it   converts   the   voltage .   you   can   find   adapters   for   just   a   few   bucks .   some   dual   voltage   products   have   a   little   switch   you   have   to   bother   with   and   it   s   dangerous   if   you   forget   to   change   that   switch ...   no   switch   and   no   worries   with   this   hair   dryer ! !   just   google   dual   voltage   and   you   can   read   up   on   it ,   and   the   difference   between   converter   and   adapter .   all   these   things   are   helpful   to   know   when   traveling   abroad .   i   love   this   thing ...   best   thing   i   bought   for   travel   recently   since   finding   a   hand   held   luggage   scale !   i   originally   jumped   the   gun   and   gave   this5   stars .   read   my   updates   below .   12   20   12   update   this   survived   a   trip   to   rural   abroad   and   worked   great ,   so   long   as   i   used   it   on   low .   when   i   turned   it   on   high   it   was   like   a   crazy   loud   rocket   ship   and   i   thought   it   would   take   off   or   start   fire   it   was   frightening ! ! ! !   yes ,   i   did   use   my   adapter ,   and   it   s   possible   it   behaved   this   way   because   of   the   junkie   old   remote   house   with   questionable   wiring   i   was   living   in .   later   i   lived   in   a   second ,   very   modern   house   in   the   country   s   modern   capital   and   it   wouldn   t   plug   into   the   wall   at   all   in   any   part   of   the   house ! !   yes ,   it   was   the   right   plug   shape   and   i   have   no   idea   what   that   was   about ,   again ,   the   randomness   is   possibly   the   result   of   the   house   and   the   country   i   was   in .   who   knows .   but   i   couldn   t   use   it   at   all   the   last   couple   of   months   of   my   travels   and   that   wasn   t   good .   i   will   continue   to   use   it   here   at   home   in   the   usa   where   it   works   perfect .   maybe   better   for   local   travel   and   still   a   great   size   if   you   have   limited   luggage   space .   but   i   am   changing   my   rating   from   5   to   3   because   the   darn   thing   nearly   gave   me   a   heart   attack   the   few   times   i   accidentally   put   it   on   high   while   trying   to   turn   it   off .   i   am   still   highly   recommending   this   product   for   travel ,   but   taking   it   abroad   may   be   questionable .   1   15   13   update   i   barely   started   using   it   back   home   a   month   and   the   dang   thing   started   making   crazy   noises   and   i   thought   it   would   explode   or   catch   fire .   it   basically   went   dead .   i   tossed   it   in   the   garbage .   i   am   now   changing   my   3   star   rating   to   1   star .   i   was   wrong .   turns   out   this   was   a   piece   of   unreliable   junk   and   potentially   dangerous   unreliable   junk   after   all ...   didn   t   even   last   me   a   year .   and   i   barely   used   it ! ! !   not   fit   for   my   traveling   adventures .
for   men   only !   ok ,   not   really ...   it   makes   me   laugh   that   this   product   is   touted   specifically   for   men .   it   s   colors   might   be   manly   red ,   blue ,   and   black   ,   but   the   hair   dryer   works   equally   well   for   a   man   or   a   woman .   my   wife   used   it   extensively .   br   br   the   dryer   itself   is   very   functional   and   excellent .   i   have   had   it   for   a   couple   months   now ,   and   it   still   works   perfectly .   with   heat   settings   and   a   nice   grip   as   well .   the   only   reason   i   couldn   t   give   it   5   stars   is   because   they   say   it   s   for   men .   makes   me   laugh .   still   though ,   worth   buying .
worst   dryer   ever ! ! !   i   didin   t   purchase   this   from   amazon   however   this   is   the   weakest ,   worst   dryer   i   have   ever   used .   i   have   owed   several   in   my   life   as   i   have   very   long   hair .   this   takes   about   25   minutes   to   dry   my   hair   fully   whereas   other   dryers   i   have   owned   previously   it   took   maybe   10   minutes .   one   of   the   reason   i   wanted   to   try   it   was   for   the   retractable   cord   which   unfortunately   does   not   work ! ! !   i   pulled   it   out   the   first   time   i   used   it   and   it   would   only   retract   about   50   of   the   way   with   the   rest   of   the   cord   hanging   like   other   dryers   without   retractable   cords .   i   would   have   to   advise   to   avoid   this   dryer   like   the   plague .   it   isn   t   even   that   cheap   for   what   you   get   so   i   can   t   see   why   someone   would   own   this .   i   m   def   going   back   to   babyliss .   sorry   conair .
best   hair   dryer   ever   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   because   it   is   the   one   my   hair   stylist   uses   in   her   salon .   and ,   since   it   s   such   a   strong   dryer ,   it   takes   much   less   time   to   dry   my   hair .   also ,   it   does   a   better   job   than   any   other   hair   dryer   i   have   ever   owned .
top   of   the   line   product !   i   was   really   affraid   to   purchase   this   product   on   line ,   since   its   just   coming   out   as   one   of   pibbs   newest   editions .   i   must   admit , this   blow   dyer   is   hands   down   top   of   the   line , i   work   mainly   with   blowouts   on   natural   hair   clients , im   saying   this   blow   dryer   can   straighten   out   the   thickest   kinky   tightly   coiled   hair   hands   down ,   during   the   blow   drying   process   the   hair   is   left   super   shinny   and   super   manageable ,   oh   and   not   to   mention   the   drying   time ,   i   m   throwing   the   in   towel   on   that   one , just   made   my   job   easier ,   super   light   weight ,   not   heavy   like   the   other   dryers   use   to   be ,   my   dryer   for   ever , love , love , love   my   new   pibbs , faster   drying   time   more   clients   fast   money  
i   love   this   hair   dryer   i   used   this   hair   dryer   for   the   first   time   at   a   hotel   and   just   had   to   have   one .   i   love   it ! !   it   s   lightweight ,   has   a   retractable   cord   and   folds .   great   for   travel   or   storage !   i   m   on   my   2nd   one   and   bought   a   3rd   to   keep   just   in   case .
wonderful   the   ceramic   dryer   made   drying   my   hair   much   easier   than   ever   before .   it   cut   my   time   down   drastically   and   no   more   tangles   at   all .   i   love   this   hair   dryer !
superb ! ! !   what   a   fantastic   hair   dryer .   it   has   the   cooler   setting ,   but   with   the   same   wind   power   as   the   high   setting   so   you   can   get   your   hair   dry   and   smooth   without   burning   it .   i   have   owned   numerous   dryers   from   vidal   sassoon   and   conair   and   many   other   brands ,   however   this   is   just   the   best   and   so   well   priced .   thank   you ,   thank   you ,   thank   you ,   andis .
light   mighty   t3   micro   featheweight   luxe   this   t3   is   easy   to   use   and   much   lighter   than   other   dryers .   it   dries   faster   and   leaves   the   hair   shiny .
i   have   naturally   frizzy   hair   it   dried   fast   enough   but   still   some   frizzing ,   probably   because   i   m   impatient .   i   love   the   fact   that   it   came   with   a   diffuser !   this   is   one   fancy   hair   dryer ..   a   little   heavy   but   that   s   ok .
t3   featherweight   hair   dryer   bourmaline   ionic   bespoke   83808   i   love   this   hair   dryer .   i   have   fine ,   thin ,   hightlighted   hair   and   it   is   the   best   blow   dryer   i   have   ever   used .   highly   recommend .
just   the   hair   dryer   i   wanted   ..   or   was   it   initial   review   this   hair   dryer   is   perfect .   it   was   extremely   inexpensive .   it   s   powerful .   it   has   multiple   settings .   it   has   a   cool   shot .   it   is   quiet .   perfect !   br   on   second   though ,   however   the   operating   buttons   are   awkwardly   placed .   while   trying   to   dry   your   hair ,   your   finger   will   inadvertently   keep   turning   the   blower   off .   extremely   poor   design .
love   it !   lightweight ,   quieter   than   most ,   and   dries   my   hair   in   half   the   time !   all   dryers   are   not   the   same   and   this   one   is   great   for   smoothing   and   straightening !
nice   hairdryer   i   am   actually   pleasantly   surprised   that   this   dryer   is   as   nice   as   it   is .   i   was   a   little   concerned   about   the   quality   because   of   the   price .   the   way   the   buttons   are   took   a   little   getting   used   to .   i   like   that   the   handle   folds   in   and   the   cord   winds   in .
love   this   hairdryer   i   first   discovered   this   hairdryer   at   the   ritz   carlton   kapalua   resort   and   loved   it .   i   ordered   one   for   myself   as   soon   as   i   returned   home .   love   the   way   it   dries   my   hair   without   scorching ,   frizzing   or   so   much   pressure   i   can   t   style   it   properly .   medium   works   great   for   me .   also   loved   the   folding   handle   as   my   bathroom   space   is   limited .   as   others   have   mentioned ,   be   careful   not   to   pull   the   cord   out   too   far ,   as   mine   stopped   retracting   after   18   months .   with   almost   3   years   of   daily   use ,   it   finally   died .   i   immediately   ordered   another   one .   at   this   price ,   one   every   3   years   is   a   bargain .
worked   for   two   years ,   then   started   smoking   we   had   this   hair   dryer   for   two   years .   it   was   for   my   boys   to   use ,   so   all   they   needed   was   a   simple   dryer .   they   usually   wound   up   using   my   nicer   hair   dryer   as   they   just   didn   t   like   this   one .   after   two   years   of   limited   use ,   it   just   started   smoking   one   day   and   we   had   to   throw   it   away .
best   blow   dryer   ever   this   hair   dryer   is   very   quiet ,   drys   quickly ,   prevents   frizz   and   includes   two   attachments   all   for   an   extremely   low   price .   it   s   the   best   hair   dryer   i   have   ever   used .   added   bonus ,   the   cord   reeler   function   makes   storage   a   breeze .   a   must   have !
good   enough   i   like   this   little   hair   dryer   it   is   small ,   lightweight   and   easy   to   use .   the   controls   are   in   a   good   place   and   it   does   a   good   job .   i   only   gave   it   four   stars   because   even   on   low   it   blows   pretty   hard   and   is   hotter   than   i   would   like   it   to   be .   for   the   price ,   it   was   a   good   enough   deal .
infiniti   blow   dryer   it   makes   your   hair   less   frizzy   as   you   blow   dry   it   well   worth   the   money ... it   also   has   a   retractable   cord .
great   dryer   at   good   price   i   wanted   a   ceramic   dryer   because   my   old   dryer   was   dryng   out   my   hair   and   making   it   appear   dry   and   course .   i   purchased   this   ceramic ,   ionic   dryer   to   protect   my   hair   and   also   achieve   br   a   softer   look .   itgave   the   results   that   i   was   looking   for .   it   certainly   works !   also   a   good   feature   it   the   automatic   cord   wind .   i   am   very   pleased .   the   dryer   was   reduced   in   price   and   br   this   made   the   purchase   sweeter   as   it   is   a   great   product   at   a   bargain   price .   br   i   would   certainly   recommend   this   dryer   and   it   deserves   the   5   star   rating .
twin   turbo   3200   ceramic   and   ionic   professional   hair   dryer   this   is   the   2nd   one   i   ve   bought   and   the   first   from   amazon .   i   loved   the   first   one   and   had   it   for   many   years .   i   paid   less   with   amazon   for   this   one   and   even   though   the   first   one   hadn   t   stopped   working   it   started   to   smell   hot   and   i   didn   t   want   to   take   a   chance .   i   will   continue   to   purchase   this   product   as   long   as   it   s   available .   my   hair   is   long   and   it   takes   no   time   at   all   to   dry   and   looks   great .
good   deal !   i   m   happy   with   the   infiniti   by   conair   223xr   dryer   and   its   features .   retractable   cord ,   1875   watts ,   different   settings   for   cold   warm   hot   temperature   and   also   low   high   air   speed   setting .   i   like   the   fact   that   it   already   comes   with   both   a   concentrator   and   diffuser .   it   doesn   t   take   long   to   dry   my   long   hair   up   to   70   faster   than   previous   ones   and   no   frizz   effect !   i   think   the   cord   is   long   enough   and   there   is   a   red   mark   to   indicate   when   to   stop   pulling .   the   dryer   has   a   nice   design   and   color .   i   ve   been   using   this   dryer   for   few   months   and   i   highly   recommend   it .
one   of   the   better   hair   dryers   i   ve   found .   it   s   not   as   quiet   as   some   of   the   very   high   end   dryers ,   but   it   s   still   quieter   than   most .   br   br   one   of   the   things   i   like   most   about   this   dryer   is   the   3   position   heat   setting   you   can   get   reasonably   cold   air   without   having   to   hold   down   a   spring   loaded   button   which   gets   kinda   old  
great   hairdryer   i   really   like   the   hairdryer .   i   had   a   previous   model   of   the   same   wattage   by   conair .   it   dries   thick   long   hair   quickly ,   and   is   not   too   loud .   br   the   only   drawback   is   that   the   barrel   is   too   wide   for   my   hairdryer   holster   hook   in   my   bathroom .   i   can   put   it   in   there   handle   first ,   but   that   is   less   ideal .
good   little   hair   dryer   it   does   what   it   s   supposed   to   do .   it   s   light   weight   and   fairly   easy   to   handle .   i   would   have   given   it   5   stars   except   that   the   cord   tangles   a   bit   while   using   it .   maybe   it   will   loosen   up   after   a   while   i   don   t   know ,   but   right   now   it   s   kind   of   annoying .   also   it   doesn   t   have   a   cool   air   button ,   which   it   didn   t   claim   to   have   one   so   it   s   not   their   fault ,   but   i   didn   t   think   of   it   checking   when   i   read   the   description .   br   br   for   the   money   it   s   a   great   item .   i   would   recommend   it   to   anyone   looking   for   a   simple   hair   dryer .
a   great   hair   dryer !   i   bought   this   dryer   for   3   reasons ,   1 .   my   dryer   is   about   to   pass   on   2 .   i   have   arthritis   in   my   shoulder   wanted   a   lighter   weight   one   3 .   based   on   the   reviews   here   i   purchased   this   dryer .   i   wasn   t   planning   on   paying   a   ton   for   a   dryer ,   my   daughter   s   a   professional   i   don   t   see   any   difference   in   her   high   priced   ones ,   except   they   are   for   professional   wear   tear !   br   i   have   fairly   long ,   course ,   thick   hair ,   that   has   always   taken   forever   to   dry .   well ,   my   hair   was   dry   in   half   the   time   it   is   lighter   than   my   other   dryer ,   so   it   didnt   kill   my   shoulder   irritate   my   arthritis .   it   has   a   nice   defusser ,   nice   small ,   not   long   like   others   so   you   can   actually   hold   it   away   from   your   hair   not   burn   your   hair   or   scalp .   i   am   very   pleased   so   far   will   look   for   other   hair   care   products   by   this   company .   i   definetly   would   recommend   it ! !
hoped   for   better   i   got   this   hoping   it   would   be   a   good   replacement   for   my   last   blow   dryer   that   i   loved ,   and   had   for   3   years .   i   like   the   bendable   handle   and   retractable   cord .   the   setting   are   nice   but   it   randomly   shuts   off   while   im   using   it ! ! !   ill   have   it   on   medium   heat   on   high   and   its   like   it   over   heats   or   something .   its   horrible   for   when   im   in   a   hurry   getting   ready   for   work   because   it   takes   at   least   10   minutes   to   cool   down   enough   for   it   to   turn   back   on .   and   its   not   the   outlet ,   or   the   fuse ,   i   can   take   it   to   every   outlet   in   my   house   and   it   still   wont   work   until   it   cools   down .   but   for   the   price   i   guess   i   shouldnt   have   expected   any   better .
incredible !   my   hair   dryer   finally   died   after   well ,   i   m   not   sure   how   old   it   was ...   maybe   25   years   read   many   of   the   reviews   on   this   and   decided   to   give   it   a   try .   excellent   hair   dryer   it   has   a   cooling   button   to   set   the   curl   which   i   forgot   about .   the   first   time   i   used   it   i   styled   half   my   head   and   suddenly   remembered   this   button   which   is   actually   very   easy   to   use ,   takes   less   than   10   secs   the   first   time   i   tried   it   the   curl   was   definitely   much   better   then   what   i   had   just   using   the   heat .   i   had   to   go   back   and   redo   the   first   half   and   was   so   pleased .   the   blow   dry   was   excellent   it   didn   t   fall   during   the   day   the   bounce   was   still   in   my   hair   the   next   day   after   sleeping   on   it   .   br   br   i   never   had   this   good   a   blow   dry   with   any   of   my   older   dryers ,   so   the   new   construction   really   does   make   a   difference .   dried   my   hair   in   half   the   time .   br   br   the   only   reason   i   gave   it   4   stars   is   the   design   of   the   handle .   it   s   much   narrower   than   my   old   dryer ,   making   it   difficult   to   handle   and   difficult   to   get   to   the   cooling   button .   i   m   hoping   i   get   used   to   it   over   time   because   it   kinda   keeps   slipping   in   my   hand .
andis   wall   mounted   hair   dryer   love   this   hair   dryer !   i   used   it   at   a   hotel   recently   and   couldn   t   believe   the   power   of   this   little   dryer .   i   have   long ,   thick   hair   and   my   hair   was   dry   in   no   time !   would   definately   recommend !
great   good   power .   easy   to   handle .   settings   don   t   get   in   the   way   of   the   handle .   this   is   the   third   one   i   ve   bought .
mostly   ok   i   purchased   this   dryer   to   replace   one   that   had   fewer   watts   and   it   did   not   have   a   cold   function   on   it .   i   think   it   does   a   great   job ,   and   the   cold   function   is   very   nice .   it   is   not   as   loud   as   my   old   one   which   was   like   a   747   landing   in   the   bathroom   .   the   only   problem   that   i   have   with   it   is   that   it   is   hard   to   turn   on   and   off   with   one   finger .   it   might   just   be   me   but ,   if   a   person   had   arthritis   or   ra ,   this   would   not   be   the   dryer   for   them .
blown   away   while   looking   for   a   hair   dryer   comparable   to   the   one   that   just   tryed   to   electrocute   me ,   i   found   this   one .   the   price   was   great   and   it   had   all   the   features   of   the   much   more   expensive   one   i   d   just   thrown   away .   i   d   give   it   a   higher   review   but   i   found   the   on   off   switch   to   be   in   an   awkard   position .   it   is   a   powerful   hair   dryer   and   well   worth   the   money .
excelent   product   this   is   an   excellent   product ,   and   we   also   received   excellent   service .   we   have   a   few   items   already   from   this   company   andis ,   and   are   extremely   happy   with   all   of   them .
died   on   day   1 ,   first   use !   i   ve   been   using   conair   infiniti   pro   for   over   10   years ,   still   works   perfectly   fine .   recently ,   i   decided   to   buy   one   more   for   my   2nd   bathroom ,   and   bought   conair   ionic   ceramic   styler .   this   new   unit   died   on   day   1 ,   i   returned   it   and   bought   a   new   conair   infiniti   pro   again .   br   br   reminds   me   of   the   saying   buy   expensive ,   cry   once .   buy   cheap ,   cry   every   day
decent   hairdryer   decent   hairdryer .   it   gets   really   hot .   doesn   t   have   separate   buttons   for   air   level   and   heat   level .   instead   it   has   one   heat   setting .   only   one   button   that   toggles   between   off   high   and   low .   the   comb   attachment   is   pretty   flimsy   and   will   have   to   be   replaced   as   the   teeth   in   the   comb   breaks   pretty   easily .   i   use   this   on   my   daughters   hair .   we   are   black   and   she   has   natural   thick   and   curly   hair .
a   very   good   hair   dryer   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   after   some   research .   it   is   extremely   light ,   not   very   noisy ,   and   the   buttons   are   in   the   right   place .   the   cord   is   a   little   short   about   62   inches   but   for   a   tiny   new   york   bathroom   with   an   electrical   outlet   at   a   waist   level   it   is   actually   perfect .   however ,   i   can   see   how   it   can   be   trouble   if   your   electrical   outlets   are   low .   br   br   i   can   t   tell   if   the   ionic   feature   does   what   is   supposed   to   do   because   i   had   not   owned   a   hair   dryer   before   this   one   for   a   long   time   so   i   can   t   compare .   i   have   very   thick   just   below   the   shoulders   hair   and   it   takes   me   about   5   minutes   to   dry   it .   it   still   gets   static   in   winter .   br   br   i   like   the   simple   white   and   black   color .   to   me   it   looks   much   better   than   the   silver   finish   on   higher   end   driers   because   they   still   look   like   plastic   and   fake   and   this   one   is   not   pretending   to   be   what   it   is   not .   the   painted   text   to   identify   on   off   and   temperature   settings   wore   off   in   two   days   but   the   settings   are   intuitive   and   so   you   don   t   really   need   the   text   once   you   saw   what   is   where .   i   ve   had   it   for   just   under   a   year   and   it   is   working   just   fine .   all   in   all   great   purchase .
do   not   buy   had   to   return   after   the   first   time   i   used   the   product ,   the   hose   burned   off   the   bonnet   connection   was   impossible   to   dry   my   hair   with   this   product .   very   loud   and   only   dries   one   section   of   your   head .
great   little   dryer   love   these   dryers !   had   one   for   9   years ,   finally   burned   out .   just   bought   2   more .   so   convenient   to   have   it   right   there   on   the   wall ,   and   the   night   light   is   a   bonus .
decent   hair   dyer   but   nothing   special   my   old   conair   ceramic   hair   dryer   just   died   after   about   4   yrs .   thought   i   would   try   this   ionic   dryer .   i   ve   used   it   for   about   3   wks   now   have   noticed   no   improvements   to   my   hair .   my   hair   is   always   shiny ,   so   who   can   say   but   as   for   frizzies   or   static   hair ,   i   have   some   issues   they   were   not   improved   by   using   this   dryer .   as   others   have   said   the   buttons   are   a   challenge   to   not   press   when   using .   you   have   to   hold   it   by   the   sides   only .   also   the   high   speed   is   not   much   different   from   the   low   neither   blow   that   much   air   compared   to   my   last   dryer   many   others   i   have   had .   but   for   what   i   pd   it   is   a   decent   dryer .   nothing   special ,   but   it   gets   the   job   of   drying   done .
good   hair   dryer   this   hair   dryer   does   a   very   good   job .   it   has   multiple   settings   for   heat   and   fan   speed .   very   good   value .
it   s   like   being   at   a   hotel !   my   wife   and   i   always   comment   on   how   nice   the   hair   dryers   are   in   a   hotel .   this   is   exactly   what   we   were   looking   for .   it   pretty   much   cuts   the   drying   time   in   half   from   our   old   hair   dryer .
irritating ,   but   i   ll   keep   using   it   not   going   to   go   get   a   new   one   bcz   this   is   my   new   one   and   i   threw   out   the   box   before   i   realized   how   irritating   it   is !   so   i   ll   keep   using   it ,   but   i   don   t   like   that   the   switch   is   really   hard   to   turn   off   on   sometimes   whether   my   hands   are   completely   dry   or   with   lotions ,   the   gripping   bumps   are   small   with   the   slide   idea ,   just   aren   t   a   good   combo .   and   then   theres   the   retractable   cord .... ha .   not   always   and   then   you   have   to   feed   it   into   the   dryer   better   than   the   entire   cord   but   irritating   nonetheless   when   it   s   purchased   bcz   of   that   feature .
very   good   design ,   suspect   reliability   i   travel   fairly   frequently ,   so   hotels   are   a   routine   affair .   i   saw   this   hair   dryer   at   a   hotel   recently .   its   performance   was   impressive   for   its   size .   as   soon   as   i   got   home   i   ordered   one .   i   found   the   included   mounting   kit   screws ,   3m   tape ,   dry   wall   anchors   a   little   flimsy .   i   used   a   better   wall   anchor   to   mount   the   dryer .   br   br   all   was   well   for   3   days .   the   hair   dryer   worked   like   a   champ ,   until   the   third   day   when   the   on   off   switch   blew   up   in   my   hands .   the   switch   had   shorted   out ,   causing   a   large   poof   of   smoke   fire .   this   of   course   happened   just   after   i   had   tossed   the   original   packaging   and   amazon   shipping   box .   so   i   contacted   the   manufacture   about   a   replacement .   they   were   very   interested   in   getting   this   dryer   to   the   corporate   offices   asap .   they   sent   out   fedex   the   next   day   to   pick   up   the   device   to   be   sent   back .   i   just   received   my   replacement   device ,   it   took   15   days   in   total   to   receive   it .   br   br   i   really   hope   this   one   lasts   a   bit   longer .   br   br   edit   i   added   photos   to   the   product   page   showing   how   the   switch   blew   up .
great   while   it   worked   this   dryer   was   a   great   one   during   the   8   months   that   it   worked .   loved   the   retractable   cord   and   how   fast   it   could   dry   my   overly   thick   hair .   br   br   usually   when   i   burn   up   a   dryer ,   i   have   some   notice   burnt   motor   smell ,   maybe   some   popping   noises   ,   but   not   this   one .   it   worked   fine   yesterday ,   and   today   would   not   work .   checked   the   outlets ,   did   the   test   reset   on   the   dryer   and   that   worked ,   but   the   dryer   itself   is   dead .   reviews   at   other   sites   show   this   to   be   a   non   uncommon   problem .
bought   it   for   my   upcoming   trip   to   paris ,   france   i   bought   this   for   my   upcoming   overseas   trip   to   paris   as   this   blowdryer   was   cheap   and   fit   my   criteria   of   being   dula   voltage   with   ceramic   technology .   i   have   average   hair   that   does   get   pretty   wavy   sometimes   looks   like   i   took   it   out   of   a   braid   plugged   it   in   and   it   started   right   up   here   in   california .   will   probably   use   this   blow   dryer   more   instead   of   straightening   my   hair .   br   br   pros   works   well   br   leaves   my   hair   smooth   and   frizz   free   br   retractable   cord   is   convenient   br   speed   and   heat   settings   br   folding   handle   br   switch   to   switch   over   to   different   voltage   is   easy   to   find   br   br   cons   haven   t   found   any   lol   br   br   it   is   a   bit   heavier   then   my   other   blowdryer   but   nothing   that   i   would   complain   about .   will   update   this   once   i   use   it   in   paris .   i   did   read   in   the   manual   that   when   used   in   the   210   250v   areas   the   settings   have   to   be   kept   on   low   and   on   hot   but   we   ll   see   if   it   is   an   issue .
great   product ! !   i   purchased   this   product   after   reading   all   the   reviews ,   and   it   did   not   disappoint .   i   love   it   because   it   dries   nicely ,   it   s   not   too   noisy   to   operate   plus   it   has   a   retractable   cord .   i   would   say   it   s   well   worth   the   price   i   bought   it   from   amazon   compared   to   other   blow   dryers ! !
over   heats ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !   after   two   months   it   just   keeps   overheating !   filter   is   clean   but   constantly   shuts   off .   i   have   very   short   thin   hair   and   this   hair   dryer   has   to   cool   down   at   a   minimum   of   three   times   before   i   can   dry   my   hair .   not   very   powerful ,   a   waist   of   money   and   another   item   sent   to   the   land   fill .
not   as   great   as   everyone   says   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   having   read   the   wonderful   reviews .   it   took   forever   to   come   and   then   didn   t   live   up   to   expectation .   i   was   hoping   to   solve   my   frizz   problem   and   speed   up   the   drying   time ,   but   i   didn   t   think   this   hair   dryer   did   either .   i   sent   it   back   and   was   pretty   annoyed   that   they   only   refunded   me   64   of   the   88   i   spent   on   it .   they   charged   me   a   restocking   fee   and   a   shipping   fee   when   i   already   paid   11   to   send   it   back   myself .   all   in   all ,   a   lousy   deal .
my   bad ...   none   available .
love   this   dryer ! !   what   is   so   exciting   about   a   hair   dryer   what   a   difference   it   makes   in   shine ,   silkiness   and   styling .   i   read   reviews   on   hair   dryers   priced   from   to   .   i   chose   this   dryer   based   upon   consistently   good   reviews ,   benefits ,   features   and   price .   this   dryer   changed   my   baby   fine ,   thin   hair   that   frizzes   in   humidity   and   loses   volume   in   dry   climates   to   lovely ,   silky   brilliantly   shiny   locks .   i   know ,   it   sounds   far   fetched ,   but   for   me ,   this   dryer   delivered   what   it   claimed .   thank   you   to   all   that   reviewed   this   product   over   the   months .   you   helped   me   choose   a   great   hair   dryer .   before   those   of   you   in   the   market   for   a   new   hair   dryer   plunk   down   200   or   even   50   for   a   hair   dryer ,   try   this   one .   i   don   t   think   you   will   be   disappointed .
works   well   my   small   emergency   hair   dryer   exploded ,   so   i   bought   this   one .   it   works   very   well   i   have   no   major   complaints .
andis   1875   watts   used   this   product   for   the   first   time   at   the   hilton   in   new   york   city .   works   great .   very   powerful   i   like   the   retractable   cord , very   nice   .   would   recommend   highly . great   price   also .
just   what   i   needed !   i   m   really   enjoying   the   use   of   this   product .   it   heats   well   and   i   m   usually   dry   in   30   minutes .   i   love   how   light   weight   it   is ,   because   i   can   hold   it   in   my   lap   while   i   either   work   on   the   computer   or   watch   tv .
definitely   wouldn   t   recommend   i   bought   this   dryer   on   5   17   12   and   it   stopped   working   on   5   30   12 .   only   used   it   twice .   it   overheats   way   to   quick   when   using   the   high   setting .   the   dryer   started   smoking   and   then   starks   start   flying   everywhere .   not   to   mention   it   blew   out   my   bathroom   plug .   i   definitely   don   t   plan   on   buying   this   brand   again ,   definitely   not   worth   it .
love   this   hairdryer !   i   was   looking   for   a   hair   dryer   that   was   gentler   on   my   hair   since   i   tend   to   use   a   flat   iron   on   it   daily .   i   was   using   one   of   the   cheapest   hair   dryers   you   could   buy   and   once   i   started   using   this   one ,   there   was   a   noticeable   difference .   it   s   much   quieter   and   the   varied   heat   controls   are   very   useful .   it   s   also   a   cute   color   that   is   very   close   to   the   picture .   it   seemed   a   little   heavy   a   first   compared   to   my   cheap   hair   dryer ,   but   you   get   used   to   it .   and   of   course ,   it   s   always   nice   to   have   a   retractable   cord .   i   m   very   happy   with   this   hair   dryer   so   far .  
best   hair   dryer   it   did   the   trick !   this   dryer   has   a   lot   of   power .   it   blew   my   hair   extremely   straight !   i   like   the   older   model ,   but   this   newer   version   is   just   as   good .   this   product   is   lighter   and   easier   to   handle .   my   only   issue   is   the   shipping   was   slow .
love   it ! ! !   every   day   i   used   to   dread   blow   drying   my   hair .   it   s   long   and   thick   and   after   a   half   an   hour   it   still   wouldn   t   be   dry .   this   hair   dryer   gets   my   hair   completely   dry   in   3   4   minutes   max .   it   has   totally   changed   my   life .   i   have   bought   one   more   just   to   have   on   hand .   you   never   know   how   long   a   hair   dryer   will   last .
yellowbird   i   purchased   this   product   because   quite   a   few   of   the   youtube   vloggers   i   follow   use   recommended   it .   i   liked   that   it   dried   my   hair   well   and   that   it   had   4   different   settings   from   cool   to   hot ,   but   i   found   that   if   you   hold   it   by   the   nozzle   end   like   i   do ,   it   heats   up   alot !   i   used   it   primarily   on   the   warm   setting   applying   the   tension   method   to   my   4b   4c   hair   and   it   was   fine .   i   accidentally   had   it   on   the   hot   setting   initially   and   that   was   too   much   heat   for   my   hair .   there   s   not   much   that   s   special   about   this   dryer ,   but   overall ,   it   s   a   powerful ,   not   too   pricey   option   if   you   are   looking   for   a   professional   style   hairdryer .
buying   second   dryer   for   reserve   bought   this   hair   dryer   over   a   year   ago   and   my   husband   and   i   have   used   it   br   everyday   since   with   no   problems .   it   is   easy   to   fold   when   we   travel   and   br   love   the   fact   that   the   cord   retracts .   i   decided   to   go   ahead   and   order   a   br   second   one   to   have   on   hand   when   this   one   goes   out   because   with   my   luck   br   it   wouldn   t   be   available   then ,   and   i   really   like   it .
conair   blow   dryer   i   had   been   looking   to   purchase   a   blow   dryer   for   our   spare   bathroom   and   trailer   when   i   found   this   one   i   was   so   happy   it   has   exceded   all   my   expectations .   it   was   such   a   good   deal .   i   am   very   pleaswed   with   the   product   and   how   fast   it   arrived .
conair   hir   dryer   review   this   hair   dryer   is   a   very   powerful   unit   that   exceeds   all   my   expectations .   i   am   so   glad   i   got   this   unit   from   conair .   the   dryer   arrived   before   the   specified   date   and   i   use   it   all   the   time   to   dry   my   hair .
faulty   plug   seller   didn   t   back   their   product   i   m   one   of   those   people   who   reads   most   reviews   before   purchasing   a   product   on   amazon .   i   understand   that   it   seems   like   most   of   the   time   there   is   that   one   or   two   people   who   speak   poorly   about   a   product   that   the   masses   rave   about .   it   s   just   a   blow   dryer ,   about   80   at   that ,   but   still   just   a   blow   dryer .   this   product   could   be   a   good   hair   dryer ,   but   the   plug   does   not   work   subsequently   neither   does   the   dryer . why   i   m   leaving   this   review   is   to   expose   the   lack   of   commitment   the   seller   has   towards   their   product   and   customer .   the   seller   would   not   respond   to   my   emails   about   this   broken   down   product   in   under   four   months .   for   the   first   3   months   the   dryer   worked   well .   then   the   dryer   at   times   would   work   and   not   work .   finally   the   dryer   would   not   turn   on .   i   cut   the   plug   off   and   tested   the   power   to   the   dryer   without   the   plug .   the   plug   is   bad   and   so   is   the   dryer   with   this   plug .
worth   every   penny   it   was   the   best   purchase   i   made   in   a   while   .   it   straightened   out   my   very   coaurse   hair   .   i   love   how   hot   it   gets   .   i   don   t   even   have   to   apply   a   flat   iron   to   my   hair   no   more   .
hairdryer   cruising   great   folding   hair   dryer   for   a   great   price .   i   needed   a   hair   dryer   to   take   on   the   fantasy   carnival   cruise .   the   glory   had   a   hair   dryer   in   the   drawer   but   unfortunately   the   fantasy   did   not .   it   is   going   on   another   cruise   this   fall   on   the   same   fantasy .
works   as   advertised   it   s   nice   to   find   a   home   appliance   that   actually   works   as   advertised .   this   remington   dryer   does   that   and   more .   br   br   it   s   very   well   made .   it   s   easy   to   operate .   and   it   dries   hair   very   fast .   we   ve   had   this   for   a   couple   of   months   and   it   s   held   up   quite   well   with   almost   daily   use   from   someone   in   the   household .   good   value   for   the   price ,   too !
very   pleased   w   product   and   delivery   was   very   fast !   this   helps   us   from   having   stuff   all   on   the   top   of   our   bathroom   countertop ,   since   we   have   limited   counter   top   in   this   bathroom .   we   had   one   before   that   hung   on   the   wall   of   the   bathroom ,   our   motorhome .   great   for   organization   small   places .
great   dryer !   i   originally   used   this   dryer   last   year   at   a   5   star   hotel   in   chicago   and   loved   it .   so   i   asked   the   desk   clerk   if   i   could   purchase   a   new   one   from   the   hotel .   yes !   my   daughter   and   i   seem   to   want   to   use   it   at   the   same   time ,   so   i   ordered   another   one   so   we   wouldn   t   have   to   fight   over   it   in   the   mornings .   highly   recommended   because   it   is   small ,   has   great   blowing   power ,   has   appropriate   heat ,   folds   in   half ,   and   has   a   retractable   cord !
great   product   i   absolutely   love   this   blow   dryer .   it   works   so   well ,   and   gets   the   job   done   in   half   the   time .   i   highly   recommend   this   blow   dryer ,   i   use   it   in   the   salon ,   and   it   gets   my   clients   in   and   out   in   half   the   time .
product   description   falls   short   of   accurate   the   hair   dryer   does   exactly   what   it   s   intended   to   do .   however ,   the   product   description   is   inaccurate .   the   so   called   cool   shot   button   does   not   exist   on   this   product .   one   thing   which   i   noticed   though   is   that   the   product   image   was   updated   with   the   blue   cool   shot   button   removed   in   the   new   image .
great   dryer   for   a   good   price   i   needed   a   dryer   with   a   diffuser   attachment   to   dry   my   permed   hair ,   so   after   looking   at   a   bunch   of   different   ones   on   amazon   i   chose   this   one .   i   think   it   s   a   great   dryer   for   the   cost .   the   diffuser   works   well   and   keeps   my   hair   curly   without   making   it   too   frizzy .   it   also   dried   it   fairly   quickly .   i   didn   t   like   how   long   the   cold   shot   button   took   to   work .   it   would   also   be   nice   if   it   got   hotter   for   the   lower   setting .   overall ,   for   the   price ,   i   think   this   was   a   great   buy   and   i   m   very   happy   with   it .
weighty   subject   the   john   frieda   jf1   does   all   it   says   it   will .   shiny   hair   with   no   static .   dries   quickly   without   the   high   pitched   roar   of   other   dryers .   the   overall   look   is   very   nice .   just   one   major   problem ... its   very   heavy .   if   you   are   in   it   for   the   long   haul , as   with   long   thick   hair   styling , you   better   be   young   and   strong .   i   am   over   sixty   and   have   medium   length   fine   hair   and   i   find   it   easier   to   just   use   the   curling   iron   on   most   days .   if   you   are   not   using   the   blow   dryer   for   styling   it   works   just   fine   and   comes   with   several   heads   for   specific   drying .
works   well   i   have   been   using   this   for   the   last   2   weeks .   and   for   the   money   is   a   decent   buy .   br   it   s   retractable   wire   is   another   plus .   cannot   comment   on   the   longevity   for   now .
just   what   i   needed !   i   m   very   picky   with   my   blowdryers .   it   always   seems   like   they   re   either   too   hot ,   not   hot   enough ,   or   don   t   give   enough   pressure   to   mold   my   hair .   this   blowdryer   suffers   from   none   of   those   problems .   on   top   of   the   high   quality   drying   it   delivers ,   it   is   also   very   comfortable   to   hold .   most   blowdryers   have   hard   plastic   handles   that   can   slip   easily   especially   after   a   shower   but   this   one   has   a   nice   rubber   texture   to   it .   i   ve   been   using   my   mangroomer   for   a   couple   of   months   now   and   i   am   thoroughly   satisfied   with   it .   highly   recommended !
first   worked   for   three   years ,   second   for   three   seconds   due   to   our   bathroom   layout ,   a   dryer   with   a   retractable   cors   and   folding   handle   works   best .   i   bought   one   of   these   three   years   ago .   it   was   used   almost   daily   by   my   husband .   due   to   his   current   hair   style   short   on   the   sides ,   missing   on   the   top   ,   each   use   was   for   less   than   a   minute .   br   br   when   it   stopped   working   just   wouldn   t   turn   on   ,   i   looked   for   another   model ,   but   this   was   the   only   one   with   both   the   handle   and   cord   features .   easy   decision .   i   ordered   another   and   put   it   in   his   cabinet .   the   next   day   he   tried   it   he   forgot   his   old   one   had   broken   and   said   that   it   only   went   on   for   a   few   seconds   before   it   would   turn   off .   it   turned   back   on   without   any   resets ,   but   repeatedly   stayed   on   for   only   a   few   seconds .   br   br   so ,   i   dug   out   the   box   from   the   recycling   and   returned   it   to   amazon .   two   days   later ,   the   third   one   was   in   his   cabinet .   three   weeks   later ,   dryer   3   is   working   fine .   br   br   basically   it   is   a   decent ,   no   frills   dryer   that   does   exactly   what   it   is   supposed   to .
pretty   good   for   the   price   this   is   the   first   blow   dryer   i   ve   ever   had .   it   s   simple   and   pretty   effective .   i   gave   it   4   5   stars   because   i   was   a   little   confused   with   how   to   make   it   work .   great   for   the   price .   it   has   only   two   settings ,   low   and   high .   i   ve   used   the   low   setting   only .   i   wish   it   had   had   a   better   explanation   for   how   to   make   it   start   working .   otherwise ,   it   s   great ,   no   complaints .
great   purchase   personally   love   the   product   compares   to   the   old   dryer   that   i   have .   also , good   for   the   price   great   for   short   hair .   curl   too
decent   hair   dryer   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   after   having   two   other   wall   mount   hair   dryers   die   after   just   a   year .   the   dryer   itself   is   a   bit   bigger   than   the   others ,   which   i   am   hoping   will   help   it   not   to   overheat ,   which   is   what   i   believe   shortened   the   life   of   the   other   hair   dryers .   the   build   quality   of   the   unit   itself   seems   pretty   good .   it   s   got   some   weight   to   it   and   it   feels   solidly   built ,   not   cheap   at   all .   br   br   my   only   complaint   with   this   unit   is   that   the   air   doesn   t   come   out   very   forcefully .   the   older ,   smaller   dryers   that   i   previously   owned   blew   much   harder   than   this   one .   my   wife   prefers   the   less   forceful   air ,   it   kind   of   acts   like   a   hair   dryer   with   a   diffuser   on   it .   br   br   overall ,   it   seems   like   a   decent   unit ,   i   hope   it   lasts   longer   than   the   others !
be   strong   girls   nice   hairdryer   but   it   is   very   heavy   to   hold   up   for   too   long .   if   you   have   short   fine   hair ,   you   can   tolerate   the   weight ,   but   if   your   hair   is   thick ,   mid   length   to   long   requiring   longer   drying   times .... holding   this   heavy   dryer   up   for   extended   periods   will   make   the   job   more   laborious   than   it   needs   to   be .   i   prefer   my   old   revlon   ionic   pro   sylist .
two   settings   too   high   and   too   low   i   am   getting   the   funny   smell   on   high   as   others   have   described .   in   addition   to   the   high   heat   setting   possibly   being   too   much   for   the   hardware   to   handle ,   it   s   also   hotter   than   i   can   handle .   br   the   fan   speed   and   temperature   are   linked ,   as   there   is   only   one   switch .   the   low   speed   is   too   low ,   but   you   have   to   use   high   heat   to   use   the   higher   speed .
broken   fan   blades   after   15   months   bought   this   for   my   wife ,   who   liked   the   product   until   three   of   the   plastic   fan   blades   broke   after   15   months   of   use .   most   likely   just   one   broke   off ,   and   its   rattling   around   inside   the   housing   immediately   caused   others   to   start   breaking .   now   the   dryer   is   worthless .   the   warranty   was   for   one   year ,   so   no   luck   there ,   and   replacement   parts   cannot   be   found .   maybe   15   months   is   ok   for   a   hair   dryer   at   this   price   point ,   i   don   t   know .   i   m   buying   another ,   and   hope   it   breaks   in   under   12   months   this   time .
just   what   i   was   looking   for   this   little   hair   dryer   was   exactly   what   i   was   looking   for ,   small ,   easy   to   travel   with ,   and   not   too   loud .   i   checked   for   other   travel   size   type   hair   dryers ,   but   found   that   many   of   them   were   too   big   and   wouldn   t   reach   from   a   floor   plug   outlet   up   to   the   mirror   because   of   the   recoiled   cord .   this   little   hair   dryer   was   perfect   for   my   needs   and   does   a   great   job   of   drying   my   hair   and   not   making   it   frizzy   as   well .   i   was   prepared   for   any   color   to   show   up ,   but   was   pleased   to   get   a   white   one   with   red   details .
does   its   job   i   am   satisfied   with   this   dryer   i   don   t   see   the   need   for   anything   fancier   than   this .   besides ,   it   s   pink   so   that   gives   it   triple   bonus   points   in   my   book .
completely   satisfied !   after   several   years   of   daily   used ,   my   trusty   conair   1875   finally   quit   on   me .   knowing   that   over   the   years   there   had   been   many   an   upgrade   to   hand   held   blow   dryers ,   i   spent   about   half   a   day   reading   through   all   the   reviews   on   amazon   and   checking   out   consumer   reports   the   latter   being   not   much   help   in   this   area ,   i   have   to   say   .   this   little   jewel   seemed   to   fit   my   needs   quiet ,   light ,   multiple   temperature   selections   and   speeds ,   and   a   cool   setting ,   too .   plus ,   it   had   that   fancy   shmancy   ion   stuff   that   s   supposed   to   make   your   hair   shine   although   my   thought   on   that   was ,   yeah ,   right   .   i   have   to   admit ,   too ,   that   i   am   partial   to   conair   as   i   have   found   that   they   last   for   years   and   provide   a   nice   powerful   flow   of   air   that   helps   me   style   my   usually   short   hair .   well ,   this   new   conair   173rz   ion   shine   ceramic   turbo   hair   dryer   is   now   my   new   love .   it   blows   through   my   hair   like   a   strong   wind   and   the   temperatures   range   from   hot   to   cool   with   a   perfect   warm   in   between   my   usual   setting   .   the   slide   temp   power   selection   system   is   not   my   preference ,   as   my   thumb   sometimes   slips   and   i   end   up   with   the   wrong   setting   for   a   second ,   but   i   am   getting   used   to   it .   it   gets   my   hair   dry   in   less   than   a   minute .   while   the   dryer   is   not   what   i   would   call   a   whisper ,   it   is   not   as   loud   as   my   previous   conair   and   for   that   i   am   thankful .   a   nice   little   extra   is   that   it   folds   in   half   at   the   top   of   the   handle   great   if   you   have   storage   issues .   but ,   the   most   surprising   thing   of   all   is   that   my   hair   actually   does   shine   when   i   m   done !   i   have   salt   and   pepper   hair   and   the   salt   gleams   like   sparkling   silver   threads   afterwards .   what   a   treat !   so ,   i   gave   this   baby   five   stars   and   hope   to   have   it   around   for   four   or   five   years   like   all   the   other   conairs   before   it .
the   best   product   ever   i   m   a   hairstylist ,   and   twinturbo   3200   is   one   of   the   best   blow   dryer   out   of   all   brands ,   if   anybody   likes   to   get   fast   and   quality   style ,   this   is   the   perfect   product ,   it   s   powerful   and   last   longer .....   i   loved   it
it   s   ok ....   my   main   issue   with   this   blow   dryer   is   that   the   attachments   slide   off   easily .   i   have   natural   textured   african   american   hair .   when   i   blow   dry   my   hair   i   split   my   hair   into   6   sections   and   use   a   quarter   size   amount   of   grapeseed   oil   in   my   hair   as   a   natural   heat   protector .   i   think   the   dryer   is   great   for   the   price   but   i   wish   that   the   attachments   were   able   to   lock   on   way   better   than   they   do .   when   this   dryer   kicks   the   bucket   i   will   not   repurchase   because   it   is   really   annoying   to   keep   sliding   the   comb   attachment   back   on .... ugh !
amazing !   just   bought   this   hair   dryer   for   my   upcoming   trip   i   needed   something   with   dual   voltage .   it   arrived   in   approx   30   hours   through   prime   shipping .   tested   it   out   tonight   and   loved   it .   i   have   thick   course   hair   that   generally   dries   moderately   straight ,   but   i   straighten   it   to   smooth   it   down .   this   hair   dryer   nearly   eliminated   my   need   to   straighten   my   hair !   it   dried   quickly   and   straight !   no   frizz ,   hardly   any   flyaways ,   and   super   soft !   i   m   very   pleased   and   definitely   recommend   this   product !   just   hope   it   ll   hold   up   to   the   english   weather !
i   love   it   it   is   faster   compared   to   my   old   one ,   the   cord   doesn   t   use   extra   space   as   it   rolls   inside ,   which   i   find   very   convenient .
not   very   powerful   it   s   definitely   not   as   good   as   the   last   conair   1875   watt   dryer   i   had   for   4   5   years .   the   dryer   doesn   t   feel   as   powerful   and   the   high   setting   feels   more   like   the   low   setting   on   my   old   dryer .
great   for   fine   hair   i   ve   had   this   dryer   for   two   and   a   half   years ,   and   it   just   died ,   but   that   s   not   bad   for   a   hair   dryer .   i   went   out   and   bought   another   the   same   day .   it   s   the   best   i   ve   ever   had   for   my   short ,   fine   hair .   the   hot   setting   isn   t   overly   hot ,   and   the   cool   setting   does   a   nice   job   of   setting   my   style .
good   excellent   product   and   frankly   deserves   attention   br   the   experiences   of   this   product   i   am   relieved   a   lot   br   and   all   my   friends   who   saw   him   aaajabu
andres   82005   tried   this   blow   dryer   at   a   hotel ,   went   to   my   iphone   and   ordered   it   immediately .   i   have   long ,   curly   hair   and   even   on   the   slow   speed ,   it   dries   my   hair   fast   with   less   frizz .
love   the   cord   reel !   i   ve   been   using   this   hair   dryer   for   over   a   year   and   i   still   love   it .   the   cord   reel   is   my   favorite   feature .   it   also   has   high ,   medium ,   and   low   heat   seatings   and   2   speeds .
you   reel   dryer   i   owned   a   remington   for   5   years   and   it   quit   on   me   so   i   purchased   this   dryer   from   my   local   store   because   it   was   reasonably   priced   and   it   had   the   reel   style   cord .   well   i   have   only   owned   it   for   3   months   and   it   has   decided   to   quit   on   me   there   is   a   short   in   the   cord   somewhere   and   if   it   is   not   plugged   in   just   right   it   will   not   work .   i   had   to   go   out   and   purchase   a   new   dryer   i   went   with   the   remington   again .
great   hair   dryer   i   love   the   hair   dryer ,   fits   the   wall   perfectly ,   cord   is   long   enough   hangs   on   hook   when   not   in   use .   br   for   the   ones   that   do   not   like   the   night   light   on   the   base ,   you   can   push   the   test   button   which   will   turn   the   light   off .   then   push   the   reset   button   to   turn   it   back   on   or   to   use   the   dryer .
don   t   use   the   concentrator   it   ll   pull   your   hair   out   the   john   frieda   jf1   hair   dryer   is   a   lightweight   hair   dryer   with   a   sleek   design   and   ceramic   heat   technology .   unfortunately ,   the   concentrator   has   a   tendency   to   get   hair   stuck   in   the   space   in   between   the   concentrator   and   the   barrel   of   the   dryer ,   then   pull   hair   out .   while   it   does   dry   pretty   quickly ,   there   isn   t   a   noticeable   difference   in   how   shiny   or   voluminous   it   makes   hair   look .   it   s   also   pretty   loud .   br   br   the   buttons   could   use   re   working   as   well ,   and   would   be   better   as   switches ,   rather   than   buttons .   the   temperature   and   speed   buttons   are   prone   to   being   switched   on   accidentally .   on   the   plus   side ,   the   hinged   filter   makes   it   easy   to   clean   and   the   cord   is   a   generous   length   8   feet   .   br   br   overall ,   the   john   frieda   jf1   isn   t   an   overly   impressive   hair   dryer   and   i   wouldn   t   recommend   it   for   the   price .
hair   dryer   review   this   hairdryer   is   overpriced   for   the   value .   i   dropped   it   and   pieces   went   flying .   i   was   able   to   put   it   back   together   but   had   to   snap   parts   back   in   place .   not   worth   the   money ,   wish   i   would   have   got   a   less   expensive   hair   dryer .   all   hair   dryers   blow   hot   air ,   this   one   blows   hot   air   for   a   large   price   tag .   not   impressed .   would   not   recommend   this   product   to   a   friend .
i   like   it !   if   i   had   to   describe   my   hair ,   i   d   simply   describe   it   as   chronically   curly .   my   old   dryer   used   to   make   my   hair   more   knotted   and   yuck   but   this   dryer   actually   makes   my   hair   super   soft !   drying   time   is   50   shorter   and   my   hair   generally   seems   more   healthy .   it   doesn   t   burn   my   hair   and   the   cord   doesn   t   tangle   much .   loving   this   dryer !   highly   recommended .
i   expected   more   from   andis   hi ,   br   br   based   on   being   happy   with   a   previous   order   of   the   smaller   and   louder   andis   30925   hangup   1600w   wall   mount   hair   dryer   with   night   light ,   ordered   this   as   a   replacement .   br   br   this   unit   is   like   it   s   from   a   totally   different   company   and   i   m   not   happy .   br   br   the   button   to   cut   off   the   power   is   flimsy   and   you   have   to   muscle   it .   i   used   to   turn   the   unit   off   to   shut   off   the   bright   night   light .   but   the   button   is   like   screwed   up   maybe   its   just   mine   but   its   not   easy   to   use   anyway .   br   br   the   night   light   is   way   too   bright   for   one .   it   s   like   having   a   small   table   lamp   on ,   so   way   to   much   to   be   called   a   night   light .   br   br   also ,   the   mounting   is   different .   you   install   a   plate   first ,   then   screw   the   unit   onto   the   plate .   it   was   hard   for   me   to   do   compared   to   the   other   andis   unit   i   got   and   then   after   a   while   it   started   to   come   loose .   br   br   if   i   had   to   guess ,   andis   purchased   this   product   from   some   other   company   and   slapped   their   name   on   it .   big   mistake   because   i   had   been   very   loyal   based   on   installing   a   few   30925   units   around   the   house .   br   br   i   m   returning   this   and   trying   the   conair   134r   unit   which   got   great   reviews .   br   br   sorry   andis   you   d   better   up   your   game   to   keep   customers   loyal .
sucks !   don   t   waste   your   money   on   this   blow   dryer   you   will   only   be   frustrated   and   end   up   with   frizzy ,   over   processed   hair .   the   brush   attachment   is   awful   and   doesn   t   grip   in   your   hair ,   you   ll   be   brushing   and   brushing   and   get   mediocre   results .   i   decided   to   give   this   a   try   after   my   trusty   conair   shorted   out   what   a   disappointment !   even   after   blow   drying   i   would   still   need   to   flat   iron   in   order   to   get   out   the   frizz .   will   never   buy   this   product   again !
too   much   light   the   hairdryer   is   great .   i   like   the   tightly   coiled   cord   and   the   peg   to   hang   it   over   so   br   that   is   doesn   t   drag   in   the   sink .   however ,   the   green   nightlight   is   entirely   too   bright .   br   i   have   to   hang   a   hand   towel   over   it   at   night   to   keep   it   from   lighting   up   my   whole   br   bedroom .   it   is   much   brighter   than   the   previous   andis   wall   mount   dryer   that   i   had   br   previously .
buttons   are   impossible   to   operate   this   hair   dryer   is   undoubtedly   a   great   price   and   it   does   get   the   job   done .   i   haven   t   had   any   fuss   with   the   fuse   or   anything   and   i   supposed   it   s   nice   having   the   kind   of   fabric   not   really ... suede   like   feel   of   the   hair   dryer   vs .   plastic   for   wet   hands .   that   said ,   the   buttons   used   to   operate   this   thing   are   impossible .   if   you   ve   recently   put   lotion   on   your   hands   then   you   can   just   forget   it .   seriously .... more   than   once   have   had   to   use   a   butter   knife   to   operate   it ,   my   friends   and   my   mom   have   had   the   same   troubles .   i   would   definitely   pay   5   for   one   with   better   buttons .
compact   powerful   dryer   it   was   so   hard   to   find   a   blow   dryer   that   had   a   lot   of   airflow   and   this   one   meets   the   price   performance   ratio .   i   highly   recommend   this .
love   this   hair   dryer   i   first   used   this   hair   dryer   at   a   hotel   i   stayed   in   recently .   i   liked   it   so   much   that   i   did   an   online   search   for   it   and   discovered   that   amazon   carried   it .   it   has   a   nice   feel   in   the   hand ,   not   too   heavy ,   with   a   comfortable   handle .   i   really   like   that   it   has   3   speeds .   it   also   has   a   cool   blast   button ,   but   i   don   t   use   that .   it   is   also   quite   quiet   for   a   hair   dryer .   one   of   the   best   features   is   the   retractable   cord .   now   i   don   t   have   a   mile   of   cord   snaking   all   over   my   countertop   and   down   the   front   of   the   cabinet .   i   bought   this   dryer   even   though   i   had   recently   bought   a   revlon   that   i   wasn   t   crazy   about   because   it   was   too   large   and   quite   loud .   very   happy   with   this !   i   hope   it   lasts   as   long   as   my   conair   that   died   after   15   or   so   years .
replacement   unit   we   had   the   previous   model   for   over   5   years .   worked   every   day   till   the   heating   element   broke .   so   we   had   to   replace   it .   new   unit   is   only   improved .   uses   the   previous   mounting   hardware   on   the   wall .   we   expect   great   things   for   this   replacement .
switch   failure   and   sparks   i   bought   two   of   these   dryers .   the   first   popped ,   sparked   and   flashed   out   of   the   box .   the   second   developed   the   same   problem   within   a   week .   frankly ,   they   are   dangerous .   steer   clear .
not   the   best   i   always   buy   dryers   with   a   diffuser   because   of   my   big   curly   hair .   but   this   one   is   a   small   bowl   shaped   diffuser   and   when   i   bring   it   up   to   dry   my   hair   if   blows   it   out   and   all   over   the   place .   it   has   these   long   holes   on   the   side   and   the   air   blows   straight   through   and   causes   my   hair   to   blow   all   over   the   place .   i   have   to   admit   i   did   like   it   because   of   the   color   and   that   s   why   i   purchased   it   not   to   forget   that   conair   is   a   good   product .   but   if   you   are   using   it   for   the   diffuser   i   d   skip   this   one .
good   hair   dryer   this   hair   dryer   works   great .   i   have   long   thin   hair   and   i   am   quite   happy   with   the   performance   of   this   dryer   and   its   settings .   the   hot   temperature   is   hot   without   being   too   burning ,   and   the   high   blows   just   the   right   amount   of   air .   i   actually   like   using   the   hair   dryer   with   the   concentrator   on   it   and   that   s   something   i   haven   t   been   able   to   say   about   any   of   the   last   other   models   i   ve   owned .   i   also   feel   like   it   dries   my   hair   without   leaving   it   frizzy ,   but   there   is   only   so   much   i   can   judge   on   that   since   my   hair   is   long ,   thin ,   and   straight .   overall ,   very   happy   with   the   product !
similar   to   chi   pro   low   emf   blow   dryer   i   bought   a   chi   ion ,   low   emf   blow   dryer   in   2005   when   another   one   of   my   cheap   blow   dryers   broke ..   i   was   fed   up   having   cheap   blow   dryers   that   never   lasted .   i   loved   the   blow   dryer ,   it   lasted   me   till   a   month   ago .   guess   the   110   i   paid   for   it   back   then   was   worth   the   6   years   i   got   out   of   it .   i   was   looking   at   buying   the   same   one   or   at   least   a   chi   blow   dryer   again ,   i   just   didn   t   want   to   spend   the   same   amount   of   money ,   i   was   hoping   to   stay   under   60 .   i   did   a   bunch   of   research   and   saw   that   this   blow   dryer ,   t3   featherweight ,   was   on   the   list   of   best   blow   dryers   the   last   few   years   and   saw   the   price   was   close   to   what   i   wanted   to   pay   and   30   cheaper   than   the   chi   i   had   before .   i   also   saw   that   it   said   it   was   a   fast   drying   blow   dryer   like   my   old   chi ,   which   i   prefer   since   i   have   a   ton   of   hair .   after   using   it   for   over   a   week .   i   think   it   works   pretty   good ..   not   much   difference   from   my   chi   i   had .   it   s   lighter   than   my   chi   and   it   s   made   of   some   kind   of   plastic   like   material .   it   also   looks   solid   white   and   black   in   the   picture ,   but   it   s   actually   got   some   kind   of   silver   pattern   going   on   over   the   white   which   i   m   not   thrilled   with ,   but   it   s   not   the   reason   i   bought   the   blow   dryer   so   i   ll   get   over   it .   seems   to   take   about   the   same   amount   of   time   to   blow   dry   my   hair   as   the   chi ,   maybe   a   little   faster .   i   usually   take   about   8   15   minutes   to   blow   dry   my   hair   depending   on   how   detailed   i   get   with   it ,   like   i   said   i   have   a   ton   of   hair .   thick   mid   back   length   hair   br   br   why   i   give   this   a   4   instead   of   a   5 ,   i   prefer   my   chi   a   little   more ,   maybe   it   s   the   solid   feel   of   it .   i   think   it   s   maybe   the   material ,   it   feels   too   light .   br   br   the   biggest   test   is   going   to   be   to   see   how   long   it   last .   if   it   makes   it   5   years   then   i   will   be   happy   with   it .
nice   product   but   poor   quality   this   hairdryer   is   overall   okay ,   albeit   the   somewhat   heavy   weight .   after   one   year   of   use   though ,   the   main   switch   just   broke   in   half .   it   s   quite   a   shame   that   such   a   1   cent   part   can   break   and   make   the   whole   product   unusable .   grrr .
don   t   believe   what   you   read !   i   purchased   this   based   on   a   write   up   in   prevention   magazine .   yes ,   a   great   dryer   with   lots   of   shine   but   the   locations   of   the   control   button   stink !   i   spend   more   time   reselecting   the   temperature   speed   on   off ,   as   no   matter   how   you   hold   this   dryer ,   you   are   pressing   a   switch .   i   would   recommend   this   to   no   one !   it   s   just   poorly   designed !
could   have   been   perfect .....   i   really   wanted   to   love   this   hair   dryer ,   and   i   do   except   for   one   thing   the   placement   of   the   control   buttons   is   terrible !   i   constantly   turn   off   the   dryer   and   switch   the   heat   settings   with   my   hand   while   i   m   drying   my   hair .   it   is   pretty   annoying .   besides   that ,   the   dryer   is   great .   it   helps   to   smooth   my   hair   and   dries   it   quickly .   it   also   looks   really   nice .   overall ,   it   is   okay ,   but   i   don   t   think   i   would   have   purchased   it   had   i   known   about   the   problem   with   the   control   buttons .
worst   packaging   ever   i   hardly   post   any   reviews   but   this   product   forced   me   to   place   one .   the   packaging   was   not   in   order .   the   attachments   of   the   dryer   were   left   opened   in   the   box .   it   seems   to   me   that   the   product   is   used   before   as   there   were   signs   of   use .   i   never   expect   open   box   shipments   from   amazon   but   this   is   an   exception .   the   product   is   in   working   condition   so   i   don   t   want   to   enter   into   the   hassles   of   returns .   i   will   keep   the   product   but   not   satisfied   with   the   shipping   and   handling .
not   as   advertised   item   as   advertised   claims   it   comes   with   a   concentrator   ,   which   is   why   i   chose   this   particular   dryer .   it   did   not   come   with   the   concentrator .   it   s   going   back .
other   reviews   correct   about   the   sparking   i   purchased   this   dryer   a   year   ago   and   it   has   performed   very   well .   i   did   go   onto   amazon   and   order   the   babybliss   tonight   because   this   dryer   has   started   sparking .   when   i   am   drying   my   hair   i   hear   and   see   sparks .   crazy   so   i   threw   it   away   and   researched   reviews   on   several   sites   and   ordered   the   babybliss .   i   do   not   want   to   wait   until   this   dryer   burns   my   hair .
still   using   it   well ,   i   haven   t   used   it   long   yet .   i   m   still   using   it .   it   works   well .   but   hard   to   put   in   all   those   extra   feature   to   blow   dry   my   hair .   we   ll   see   how   good   long   it   will   last   me ...
heavy   and   awkward   i   was   surprised   by   how   heavy   and   unwieldy   this   cheery   yellow   bird   is .   i   ve   been   spoiled   by   lighter   dryers   and   find   my   arms   feeling   weary   and   unwilling   to   spend   time   styling .   not   conair   s   fault ,   it   was   my   bad   for   thinking   it   would   be   lighter   than   it   looks .   it   s   getting   shoved   to   the   back   of   a   junk   drawer .   rats .
awesome !   i   have   really   long   hair   but   this   dryer   dries   my   hair   very   quickly .. it   also   makes   my   hair   a   lot   smoother !   i   would   definitely   recommend   to   others   for   its   price   and   quality .
great   hairdryer   until   something   breaks   asin   b000r80ztq   infiniti   by   conair   223xr ,   1875   watt   tourmaline   ceramic   2   in   1   styler ,   cord   reel   dryer   br   br   i   bought   this   hairdryer   from   amazon   in   july   2011   for   27.19   including   the   tax .   it   is   now   april   2012   and   the   cord   stopped   retracting .   i   just   called   conair   customer   service   and   in   order   for   them   to   repair   it   at   no   charge   ,   i   must   send   it   to   them ,   at   my   own   expense   and   must   send   them   7   for   return   shipping   and   they   will   repair   it   and   return   it   to   me .   i   was   going   to   do   it ,   not   having   a   clue   what   i   would   do   without   a   hairdryer   in   the   interim ,   when   i   checked   amazon   again ,   and   saw   that   i   could   buy   a   brand   new   one   for   19.25   with   no   tax   and ,   of   course ,   free   shipping .   obviously ,   that   was   the   option   i   chose .   br   br   although   i   liked   everything   about   this   dryer ,   i   find   it   very   annoying   that   after   only   9   months ,   i   need   to   replace   it .   anything   similar   in   quality   and   features   cost   more   money   so   now   i   will   see   how   long   this   new   one   lasts .   this   is   very   disappointing .
good   portable   hair   dryer   i   have   had   multiples   of   this   hair   dryer   over   the   past   5   years   or   so .   it   works   well   has   a   reasonable   amount   of   power   and   is   great   for   travel ,   because   it   is   so   compact .   that   said ,   i   would   not   give   5   stars ,   because   it   always   goes   south   and   inevitably   eventually   just   loses   steam   and   then   dies   altogether .   i   have   found   that   it   can   be   somewhat   inconsistent   in   power   delivery   that   appears   to   be   a   constant   feature   of   this   particular   design ,   for   whatever   reason .   still ,   i   like   and   use   these   and   do   recommend   them   with   that   caveat .
industrial   strength   dryer   with   retractable   cord   i   like   the   retractable   cord   of   this   dryer   the   most ,   the   dryer   itself   is   very   loud   and   heavy ,   everytime   i   dry   my   hair   it   feels   and   sounds   like   i   m   running   my   vacuum   cleaner .   br   it   does   dry   hair   but   i   m   not   feeling   the   ionic   part   of   the   dryer ,   i   had   a   different   brand   before   that   worked   way   better .   at   least   this   one   dries   decently .   i   am   going   to   keep   using   it ,   but   probably   wouldn   t   recommend   it   to   friends .
heavy ,   slow ,   powerless .   i   hate   it .   it   weighs   a   ton .   it   has   no   blow   power   and   takes   forever   to   dry   my   hair .   once   it   s   dry ,   it   s   flat .   any   natural   waves   have   just   given   up   the   ghost ,   regardless   of   hair   product   used .   br   br   i   hate   it .   and   i   ve   replaced   it .   waste   of   money .
best   hair   dryer   evah   i   first   used   this   hair   dryer   at   courtyard   marriott .   it   worked   so   good   and   did   wonders   for   my   hair .   i   was   thrilled   to   see   that   amazon   was   selling   these .   it   dries   my   hair   fast   and   gives   it   a   silky   smooth   look .   i   highly   recommend   this   hair   dryer .
best   blowdryer ,   great   service   i   saw   this   dryer   in   good   housekeeping   magazine   and   decided   to   give   it   a   try ,   even   though   i   was   pretty   happy   with   my   current   1875   watt   dryer .   this   one   really   is   better !   dries   faster ,   and   seems   very   gentle .   the   cooling   feature   is   great   for   setting   curls   and   body .   br   br   i   ordered   a   second   dryer   for   my   daughter ,   but   when   it   came   there   was   an   unpleasant   buzzing   sound   when   running   on   high   speed .   i   knew   this   wasn   t   right .   i   contacted   amazon   about   the   defective   product ,   return   shipping   was   free   and   easy ,   and   a   replacement   arrived   in   two   days .   thanks ,   amazon !
why   change   a   good   thing   overall ,   i   like   the   dryer .   the   only   thing   i   don   t   like   is   that   they   have   changed   the   design .   the   newer   design   is   much   wider   on   the   wall   and   it   doesn   t   fit   in   the   same   screw   holes   so   you   have   to   drill   more   holes   in   the   wall !
works   fine   overall   i   found   this   dryer   to   be   well   built ,   powerful   unit   though   a   bit   on   the   heavy   side .   being   a   bit   of   a   procrastinator   when   it   comes   tto   getting   haircuts ,   my   hair   tends   to   get   fairly   long   between   cuts   and   this   dryer   worked   quickly   and   did   a   good   job .   br   br   since   it   s   very   similar   to   the   unit   my   wife   uses   and   i   use   now   and   then   i   m   sure   it   would   be   fine   for   her   use   as   well .   br   br   not   sure   what   the   point   of   the   ion   setting   is   all   about   doesn   t   seem   to   make   any   difference   when   i   used   it   ,   but   it   s   there .   br   br   if   i   needed   a   new   dryer ,   this   would   fill   the   bill .
lots   of   power   yet   so   lightweight !   i   have   been   a   blowdry   failure   all   my   life !   just   can   t   seem   to   use   a   normal   size   blow   dryer   to   style   my   hair   without   blowing   all   the   previously   styled   hair   to   smithereens .   when   i   opened   the   box   for   this   dryer   and   saw   how   small   it   was ,   i   thought   what ,   is   this   battery   operated   it   will   take   forever   to   dry   my   hair !   but   i   have   been   pleasantly   surprised .   it   is   powerful   enough   to   dry   my   thick   hair ,   and   lightweight   enough   that   my   arm   doesn   t   tire   when   i   style   for   volume .   i   can   move   it   around   and   hold   it   up   in   the   air ,   behind   my   head ,   whatever .   if   you   have   limited   arm   movement   or   muscles   that   fatigue   easily ,   this   is   the   dryer   for   you .   i   do   wish   it   had   a   cold   shot   button ,   but   that   is   the   only   drawback .
do   not   buy   does   not   work   overseas !   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   for   travel   to   england   ireland ,   along   with   an   adapter .   the   dryer   was   advertised   as   dual   voltage   for   worldwide   travel .   that   was   a   false   statement .   the   first   time   we   plugged   it   in ,   it   fried ! ! ! !   it   was   a   huge   waste   of   money .   i   will   never   by   a   conair   dryer   again .
powerful   blow   dryer   for   men   and   women   alike   i   was   extremely   excited   to   try   out   this   product   and   i   have   to   say ,   i   have   been   impressed   with   it .   i   normally   set   the   blow   dryer   to   it   s   highest   and   warmest   setting ,   and   i   am   very   pleased   with   the   performance   of   this   dryer   in   that   regard .   it   is   extremely   powerful ,   but   it   doesn   t   get   too   hot   or   overheat   if   i   don   t   move   it   constantly ,   a   nice   feature   that   many   other   dryers   i   ve   used   don   t   have .   i   don   t   personally   use   the   add   on   attachment ,   so   i   can   t   comment   on   it ,   but   it   seems   like   it   would   be   a   useful   tool   for   those   who   needed   that   specific   form   of   styling .
quiet   hair   dryer   wanted   hairdryer   is   not   as   quiet   as   claimed ,   easy   to   handle ,   buttons   seem   to   be   in   the   wrong   place ,   since   i   continually   turn   dryer   off   accidentally   while   attempting   to   dry   hair .   drying   capabilities   are   good ,   i   would   give   the   item   no   more   than   a   c   have   definitely   had   better   hairdryers .   will   most   likely   purchase   another   much   quieter   one   and   keep   this   as   a   back   up !   br   not   recommended   if   someone   is   concerned   about   noise   levels .
good   hair   dryer   my   old   dryer   my   very   old   dryer !   needed   to   be   replaced   and   i   decided   for   the   price ,   this   was   worth   a   go .   plus ,   this   dryer   was   rated   top   10   on   several   sites   i   looked   into .   br   bottom   line   it   works .   it   s   quiet .   the   cord   retracts .   it   s   not   heavy   ! !   .   does   it   do   the   dishes   no ,   it   doesn   t   and   maybe   i   should   complain   about   that .   but   seriously ,   it   s .... a .... hair   dryer .   the   one   thing   i   can   see   is   that   if   you   were   used   to   a   hair   dryer   that   just   blew   hot   air ,   you   might   think   this   dryer   makes   your   hair   flatter .   it   doesn   t   cook   your   cuticle   so   your   hair   does   lay   flatter   and   ultimately ,   feels   softer .   but   less   damage   is   worth   it   you   can   always   adjust   your   products   or   hair   style .   well   worth   the   20   i   paid .
not   up   to   prior   conair   standards   i   ve   been   using   conair   hair   dryers   for   20   years .   i   stuck   to   this   brand   because   they   ve   always   provided   good   merchandise   that   was   a   good   value   for   the   money .   that   long   streak   ended   with   this   product .   br   br   pros   br   1 .   several   different   speed   heat   settings   provide   a   useful   array   of   options   br   2 .   fairly   inexpensive   br   br   cons   br   1 .   there   are   two   back   filter   screens   the   outer   one   will   not   stay   attached   to   the   unit   on   the   clip   side ,   the   closing   latch   is   defective   i   removed   it   entirely   because   it   doesn   t   seem   to   affect   the   operation   of   the   unit   considering   that   the   second   screen   is   built   in   usable   br   2 .   the   hottest   setting   is   not   very   hot   br   3 .   the   slide   controls   are   not   aligned   well   they   slip   past   the   detents   require   too   much   force   to   push   br   4 .   overall   cheap   construction ,   even   for   this   fairly   low   price .   br   br   all   of   this   results   in   a   poorly   made   unit ,   not   at   all   worth   the   price .   a   big   disappointment   for   a   dedicated   conair   user .   time   for   me   to   look   for   another   brand .
good   buy ! ! !   this   a   wonderful   little   dryer   at   a   remarkably   low   price .   it   is   quiet   and   efficient .   this   is   a   very   good   buy ! ! ! !   recommended .
flattens   hair   my   sister   in   law   is   a   hair   stylist   and   swears   by   this   brand   but   when   i   used   the   dryer ,   it   didn   t   do   anything   special   for   my   hair   at   all .   in   fact ,   it   made   it   look   so   flat   and   left   my   hair   without   any   body .   my   hair   felt   smooth   and   soft ,   but   it   didn   t   necessarily   look   that   way .   even   on   the   highest   setting   there   s   not   a   whole   lot   of   power ,   it   blows   less   air   and   doesn   t   get   as   hot   as   my   previous   dryer   i   had   an   elchim   and   it   was   definitely   better .   not   sure   if   the   wattage   has   much   to   do   with   it ,   this   is   1875   and   my   elchim   was   2000 .   but   the   1875   should   be   fine   for   my   hair   since   it   s   normal   and   not   too   thick .   if   you   want   the   flat ,   straight   ironed   look   and   have   thicker   hair ,   this   might   work   for   you .   for   the   price   i   paid ,   i   wasn   t   impressed .   for   the   record ,   my   sister   in   law   s   dryer   performs   much   differently ,   even   though   it   s   the   exact   same   model .   that   makes   me   suspicious   that   perhaps   this   was   a   refurbished   dryer   or   maybe   even   a   fake   if   that   s   even   possible .   the   box   was   not   sealed ,   though   the   packaging   inside   was   fine .   i   d   be   interested   to   hear   if   anyone   else   had   the   same   experience .
almostt   great   the   cord   is   too   long .   if   the   cord   had   a   spiral   or   curled   design ,   it   would   be   a   lot   easier   to   use   and   take   up   less   space .
hair   dryer   the   dryer   does   not   look   very   sturdy   inferior   plastic   also   when   using   dryer   the   cap   became   very   soft   and   felt   like   it   was   melting .
just   okay   overpriced   i   had   severely   damaged   hair   due   to   coloring ,   highlighting   and   flatironing .   i   saw   that   this   blowdryer   was   supposed   to   dry   hair   faster   and   condition   it   as   well   with   the   trick   ions   . very   disappointed   in   this   dryer   for   the   money ! !   not   faster   by   any   means ,   actually   it   blows   slower   and   cooler   and   takes   longer   than   my   sally   s   beauty   supply   brand   which   is   far   less   money .   don   t   take   the   advertising   bait ,   don   t   purchase   this   dryer   ladies   and   gents .
this   is   great !   powerful   and   very   lovely   to   use !   highly   recommend !   i   just   used   it   for   the   first   time   today   and   it   dried   my   hair   very   quickly !  
it   worked   great   for   18   months   and   then   it   died .   i   read   so   many   reviews   on   this   hair   dryer   before   i   bought   it   and   i   purchased   it   anyway   despite   the   fact   that   several   people   noted   it   died   shortly   after   purchase ... so   mea   culpa .   here   are   the   positives   br   br   it   s   very   light   br   br   generates   great   heat   br   br   love   the   extra   long   cord   br   br   they   provided   extra   filters   when   i   purchased   it   which   i   thought   was   a   good   thing   but ....   br   br   now   the   negatives   br   br   even   if   you   change   the   filter   regularly   hint ,   hint   with   the   included   extras   ,   mine   died   after   a   year .   br   br   it   s   passing   was   very   dramatic   and   looked   like   it   was   going   to   catch   on   fire ,   and   smelled   like   it   too .   br   br   so   it   s   great   as   long   as   it   works ,   until   it   doesn   t ........
andis   styler   hair   dryer   we   have   been   looking   for   this   style   of   hair   dryer   for   some   time .   a   similar   but   different   brand   dryer   from   local   store   was   disappointing   loud ,   strong   vibration ,   poorly   made .   we   have   been   very   pleased   with   the   well   made   andis   dryer   after   several   weeks   of   use .   it   is   quiet ,   vibration   free ,   well   made   with   a   long   cord .

short   life   expectancy   i   was   thrilled   with   this   low   cost ,   lightweight   and   well   performing   dryer .   it   is   perfect   for   everyday   use   and   travel .   however ,   it   stopped   working   after   only   two   months   of   moderate   use .   disposable   should   be   added   to   the   product   description .
nice   hair   dryer ,   and   great   news ,   women   can   use   it   too !   as   my   hair   has   gotten   longer ,   i   ve   suddenly   seen   the   need   for   for   a   hairdryer .   i   m   a   man ,   but   let   me   just   say   mangroomer   is   a   brand .   there   s   no   reason   women   can   t   use   this   dryer   as   well ,   since   male   and   female   hair   is   pretty   much   the   same .   this   unit   has   worked   quite   well   for   my   purposes .   br   br   pros   br   high   power   1875w   motor .   br   3   heat   and   2   speed   settings .   i   tend   to   use   the   lowest   heat   and   highest   speed .   br   cold   air   button   to   finish   things   off .   br   comfy   rubber   grip .   br   long   cord .   br   it   looks   cool !   br   br   cons   br   not   really   sure   the   magical   ion   feature   actually   does   anything .   br   annoying   packaging .   br   br   this   hairdryer   does   the   job   and   looks   cool   doing   it .   recommended   for   men   or   women   who   want   to   be   groomered .
inexpensive ,   portable   and   gets   the   job   done   i   did   quite   a   bit   of   research   before   pulling   the   trigger   on   a   new   hair   dryer .   i   was   a   bit   hesitant   to   get   a   fold   able   travel   dryer   since   their   reviews   don   t   tend   to   be   as   good ,   however   this   one   was   the   exception ,   which   is   why   i   went   for   it .   the   main   features   i   was   looking   for   in   a   new   dryer   was   the   weight ,   size ,   power   and   i   would   prefer   it   to   be   a   ceramic   dryer   since   they   are   healthier   on   your   hair .   my   old   dryer   was   the   vidal   sassoon   vs501   1875w   ionic   sensor   touch   dryer .   the   vs501   lasted   me   several   years   and   technically   it   still   works .   i   ve   dropped   it   enough   times   that   the   front   cover   has   broken   making   it   a   bit   difficult   to   work   the   buttons .   below   i   have   compared   the   two   dryers   br   br   conair   173rz   vs .   vidal   sassoon   vs501   br   br   conair   173rz   pros   br   lighter   and   smaller   than   the   vs501 ,   which   is   easier   on   my   arm   br   puts   out   more   air   than   the   vs501   br   folds   up   for   easy   storage   and   travel   br   br   conair   173rz   cons   br   not   as   hot   as   the   vs501 ,   but   still   drys   hair   just   as   fast   if   not   faster   due   to   the   air   flow   br   shorter   cord   than   the   vs501 ,   which   unless   you   need   it   can   make   it   easier   to   store   br   br   overall   summery   br   the   conair   is   a   great   buy   with   the   features   of   a   full   size   dryer   packed   into   a   small ,   fold   able ,   lightweight   design .   the   color   isn   t   my   favorite ,   but   the   fact   that   it   meets   all   my   criteria   and   i   can   take   it   with   me   when   i   travel   makes   up   for   it .
great   lightweight   hairdryer   there   is   not   much   i   require   of   a   hair   dryer ,   just   one   that   dries   hair   quickly   and   has   options   for   heat   and   airflow   level .   i   m   not   sure   the   high   priced   hairdryers   actually   perform   any   better   than   this   one   which   costs   less   than   20 .   great   buy   in   my   opinion .
a   worthy   purchase   this   product   was   a   worthy   buy ,   it   is   inexpensive   and   not   heavy   duty .   great   for   everyday   use   and   it   s   light   weight   makes   it   easy   to   pack   for   travelling .
buyer   beware !   dangerous !   buy   with   caution !   the   dryer   worked   great   for   my   hair .   i   seldomly   used   it   and   i   never   dropped   it .   while   using   it   one   day ,   the   motor   exploded   from   the   back   of   the   dryer   and   hit   me   in   the   face .   i   turned   it   on   and   heard   a   strange   noise .   so   naturally ,   i   decided   to   turn   it   off   to   see   what   could   be   wrong .   before   i   could   turn   it   off ,   it   had   already   exploded   and   smoke   started   to   come   out   of   the   dryer !   pieces   of   the   dryer   hit   me   in   the   face .   quite   hard !   i   don   t   know   if   the   one   i   received   was   defective   or   if   this   is   a   common   issue   with   this   model   dryer .   caution   to   all !
it   s   hot !   two   settings   low   hot   or   high   hot .   it   s   really   featherweight .   quick   drying   time   but   the   motor   doesn   t   sound   as   good   as   my   old   italian   made   dryer .   i   wish   i   had   tested   it   out   in   person   first   before   buying   i   would   return   it   but   i   got   it   for   a   song   and   don   t   want   to   pay   the   shipping   cost   and   15   restocking   fee .   it   ll   do .
ridiculous   mounting   system   having   owned   a   couple   of   the   predecessors   of   this   dryer ,   which   were   always   quite   satisfactory ,   i   find   this   newly   designed   mounting   system   to   be   a   poor   excuse   for   a   mounting   bracket .   the   screws   meant   to   hold   the   dryer   to   the   bracket   are   totally   inadequate .. too   small   to   withstand   the   torsion   of   removing   and   replacing   the   dryer   on   the   bracket .   i   can   t   imagine   how   much   was   saved   by   changing   to   this   style ,   but   it   certainly   leaves   a   bad   taste   for   the   overall   quality   of   the   dryer .
t   3   hair   dryer   when   i   bought   my   first   t   3   i   paid   220.00   at   a   hair   salon ,   i   was   told   it   was   hands   down ,   the   best   blow   dryer .   it   was   awesome ,   but   after   3   years   i   started   having   problems .   i   certainly   didn   t   want   to   pay   200.00   dollars   again   but   the   drug   store   dryers   were   not   powerful   enough   for   my   hair ...... so   my   daughter   encouraged   me   to   try   amazon .   i   never   thought   i   would   find   the   t   3   on   amazon   but   to   my   surprise   i   did   find   it !   i   was   able   to   get   a   brand   new ,   perfect   t   3   for   64.95   from   discount   jungle !   i   was   a   little   nervous   till   i   got   it   but   it   was   perfect ,   it   works   better   than   the   one   i   got   from   the   salon ! ! !   i   feel   like   i   got   the   deal   of   my   life !
sorry   piece   of   junk   my   husband   purchased   this   dryer   for   me .   within   a   couple   of   uses   it   stopped   blowing   hot   air .   he   reminds   me   all   the   time   how   much   money   he   spent   and   how   it   can   t   be   used .
not   just   a   lot   of   hot   air   confession   time   i   am   not   a   man .   i   don   t   even   know   a   man   who   uses   a   hairdryer ,   so   i   don   t   know   why   this   is   for   men .   that   being   said ,   this   is   the   best   hairdryer   i   have   ever   used .   don   t   ask   me   to   explain   what   that   ionic   setting   does   the   manufacturer   doesn   t   even   explain   it   to   my   satisfaction .   but ,   somehow ,   it   does   work   on   my   cobweb   fine ,   delicate ,   difficult ,   body   less ,   totally   straight ,   almost   waist   length   hair .   i   wear   it   long   and   braided   so   i   can   ignore   it   as   much   as   possible ,   and   so   it   doesn   t   fly   around   all   the   time   and   get   tangled   in   stuff   or   end   up   in   people   s   food .   i   only   wash   it   once   a   week   because   it   s   so   darn   dry   it   would   probably   all   fall   out   if   i   washed   it   every   day .   i   don   t   perm ,   color ,   or   otherwise   mess   with   it   because   chemicals   just   destroy   it .   i   ve   had   the   split   ends   of   my   braid   knot   up   so   badly   in   the   wind   that   i   ve   had   to   cut   an   inch   or   more   off .   most   hairdryers   are   really   hard   on   my   hair ,   so   i   use   them   as   little   as   possible .   br   br   i   like   the   design   of   this   hairdryer   it   s   fairly   light ,   comfortable   to   hold ,   and   the   attachment   nozzle   is   nice   for   focusing   the   air   where   i   want   it .   there   s   nowhere   my   hair   can   fly   into   the   works   and   get   tangled .   i   use   the   ionic   setting   with   the   heat   on   high ,   and   control   the   amount   of   hot   air   with   the   handy   cool   burst   blue   button   that   turns   the   heat   off .   my   hair   dries   faster   and   untangles   easier   than   it   ever   has   in   my   life .   not   only   that ,   but   it   stays   untangled   all   week .   how   is   this   possible   i   don   t   know .   i   don   t   care !   br   br   i   thought   maybe   i   was   imagining   all   this ,   so   i   asked   my   daughter   in   law   to   try   it .   she   said ,   that   was   the   best   experience   i   ve   ever   had   with   any   hairdryer   in   my   whole   life .   br   br   please   don   t   comment   that   this   can   t   possibly   work   and   it   s   all   unscientific   and   that   i   m   making   stuff   up ,   as   someone   has   on   one   of   my   other   reviews .   for   me ,   this   hairdryer   makes   a   positive   difference   pun   intended   on   my   hair .   now   i   m   going   to   buy   one   for   my   daughter   in   law !
great   performs   great ,   no   problems .   light   is   perfect   brightness .   1200   watt   setting   works   just   fine .   great   space   saver .   used   in   hotels   and   great   for   kids   bathrooms .
not   a   bad   dryer   this   really   is   a   good   hair   dryer ,   it   gets   very   hot   which   i   love   and   dries   the   hair   quickly .   i   have   long   hair   and   it   didn   t   take   me   long   at   all   to   dry   it .   the   dryer   itself   is   pretty   heavy   but   that   was   not   a   problem   for   me ,   to   others   it   may   be   though .   the   reason   i   gave   this   product   a   3   is   because   i   bought   it   on   sept   4   2010   and   finally   just   had   to   replace   it   about   2   months   ago   because   it   started   to   make   the   most   god   awful   noise   when   i   would   use   it ,   i   can   only   describe   the   noise   as   slowly   murdering   a   cat   behind   the   engine   of   a   plane .   i   do   like   conair   products   and   it   was   definitely   a   good   dryer   and   lasted   me   for   quite   a   while .
a   consumer   report   recommendation   i   usually   look   up   consumer   reports   on   most   of   my   purchases .   over   the   years   they   have   proven   to   be   trustworthy   and   my   purchases   at   their   recommendation   has   saved   me   money   and   headaches .   the   revlon   hairdryer   has   just   been   purchased   but   i   like   it   already .   it   is   priced   affordably   but   has   many   options   and   handles   easily .   not   disappointed   in   the   least .

a   skeptic   no   longer   this   really   is   a   better   dryer   is   it   the   best   i   don   t   know   but   i   am   really   glad   to   have   it .   purchased   at   folica   when   they   had   a   40   off   special .   br   br   i   have   thick   medium   length   wavy   fine   hair .   wash   it   5   6   days   a   week   at   the   gym .   had   been   using   their   hot   tools   dryers   two   at   a   time ,   one   in   each   hand   quite   a   spectacle   and   then   using   a   flat   iron .   i   was   happy   with   the   end   result   but   wanted   to   reduce   the   time   spent .   br   br   researched   the   dryers   to   death   and   then   just   got   fatigued   and   popped   for   the   sedu   as   it   has   tourmaline   and   ionic ,   and   it   has   a   regular   plug   i   had   some   bad   luck   with   those   huge   gf   plugs   on   my   hair   iron .   the   price   is   insane   but   since   i   use   this   nearly   every   day   .   .   .   .   br   br   compared   to   the   hot   tools   dryer ,   this   does   not   get   hotter   which   is   a   good   thing   because   the   hot   tools   is   plenty   hot   enough   to   fry   your   hair   ,   but   it   does   blow   more   forcefully .   the   dryer   is   small   and   easy   to   handle .   did   not   find   it   at   all   heavy .   was   able   to   use   the   one   dryer   in   one   hand   and   brush   in   the   other .   it   still   got   my   hair   dryer   faster   than   using   the   two   hot   tool   dryers .   and   much   straighter   and   much   smoother .   that   was   the   surprise ,   and   the   reason   i   say   i   am   a   skeptic   no   longer .   something   about   the   dryer   the   tourmaline   the   ions   really   does   make   a   difference .   because   my   hair   was   already   straighter   by   the   time   it   was   dry   since   i   could   use   the   brush   the   time   spent   using   the   flat   iron   was   significantly   reduced .   br   i   hope   that   with   in   addition   to   reducing   the   time   i   have   also   reduced   the   trauma   to   my   hair .   br   br   i   cannot   tell   if   this   is   worth   the   big   premium   over   the   solia   and   the   supersolano   which   both   look   to   be   very   nice   dryers .   but   i   am   very   happy   with   the   sedu .
shiny   hair   for   the   price ,   i   am   ver   happy   with   this   dryer .   i   was   willing   to   pay   up   to   100   on   a   new   dryer   because   my   hair   was   looking   so   dry ,   dull   and   damaged .   i   used   this   dryer   of   a   friends   and   really   liked   the   results   so   i   bought   one   for   myself .   for   the   price ,   it   really   can   t   be   beat .   my   hair   is   softer ,   shinier   and   has   much   more   body   than   with   my   old   hair   dryer .   br   br   it   takes   about   the   same   amount   of   time   as   my   old   traditional   dryer   and   is   about   the   same   weight   so   i   didn   t   notice   any   change   there .
very   compact   this   item   is   great   if   you   have   a   small   bathroom   like   i   do .   it   hangs   on   the   wall   and   is   convenient .   it   doesn   t   have   any   features   and   only   two   speeds   may   be   a   drawback   for   some .   but   that   is   really   all   i   need .   it   has   no   attachments   but   i   just   use   my   own   brush   to   control   my   hair   as   i   blow   dry .
doa   pos   used   once   for   2   minutes   on   low   heat .   second   use   was   on   high ,   fan   stopped   almost   immediately   but   the   heating   element   stayed   on .   stink   to   high   heaven   and   extremely   hot .   safety   plug   did   not   trip   off   and   neither   did   my   gfci .   beware   this   is   very   dangerous !   this   piece   of   garbage   going   back   tomorrow .   not   even   worth   the   8.62   i   spent .
i   love   this !   i   have   a   disability   so   i   can   only   dry   hair   one   handed . i   searched   all   over   the   net   for   a   hands   free   dryer   holder   and   this   one   was   exactly   what   i   was   looking   for . i   stick   it   up   on   my   mirror   after   showering   but   am   planning   on   attaching   it   to   my   wall   if   they   ever   get   more   in   stock . please   put   more   in   stock ! i   need   another   one   to   take   with   me   on   vacation !
horrible   i   bought   this   dryer   based   on   reviews .   i   have   had   it   about   2   months   now   and   every   time   i   use   it   the   handle   gets   so   hot   that   i   actually   get   1st   degree   burns   on   my   palm .   i   am   trashing   this   and   getting   a   new   non   revlon   dryer .   stay   away ! ! ! ! ! !
so   sad   to   replace   it   .   .   .   i   got   this   dryer   about   8   months   ago ,   and   it   is   does   not   turn   on   anymore .   the   buttons   were   very   difficult   to   work ,   but   the   longer   i   had   it ,   the   easier   it   became   to   slide   them .   it   does   have   heat   settings   which   i   like ,   but   the   retractable   cord   is   not   very   dependable .   after   trying   out   different   hairdryers ,   i   realize   how   much   i   liked   this   one   despite   its   fallbacks .   i   guess   i   just   got   really   attached   to   it .

great   hairdryer   worth   the   price   i   have   a   lot   of   hair   and   have   owned   a   lot   of   hairdryers   in   my   life .   i   would   have   never   guessed   that   owning   a   professional   hair   dryer   could   make   such   a   difference .   this   thing   is   amazing .   it   s   works   so   much   faster   than   any   other   dryer   i   have   ever   owned .   i   originally   started   thinking   about   paying   the   big   bucks   for   a   pro   dryer   after   reading   an   article   on   jezebel .   i   had   this   thing   on   my   wish   list   for   a   few   months ,   not   quite   sure   i   wanted   to   spend   so   much   for   hairdryer .   i   ended   up   buying   it   for   myself   as   a   birthday   present   what   a   great   decision .   br   br   if   you   have   long ,   thick ,   coarse   or   difficult   to   manage   hair ,   seriously   consider   stepping   up   to   a   professional   dryer .
hairdryer   i   does   not   have   a   difuser ,   but   is   a   very   lite   and   comfortable   grip .   leaves   your   hair   shinny .   like   it .
like   a   hotel   blowdryer !   i   grew   up   using   a   crappy   blowdryer   that   my   mom   originally   bought   for   our   cat .   i   have   straight   hair   so   i   never   really   blowdry   except   when   i   need   to   tie   my   hair   up   in   a   neat   bun   for   work   .   i   bought   this   on   sale   for   10   at   target   and   it   exceeded   my   expectations !   it   s   really   powerful   and   exactly   like   the   ones   in   5   star   hotels .   i   love   that   it   has   cold ,   warm   and   hot   settings .   it   came   with   that   round   attachment   which   i   ve   never   used .   the   little   booklet   in   the   box   shows   a   hair   straightening   attachment   which   was   not   included   in   mine .   i   don   t   really   need   it   so   it   s   not   a   big   deal .   i   highly   recommend   this   product .   it   is   a   little   big   but   not   heavy .
great   product   if   you   want   to   get   electrocuted .   i   really   wanted   to   love   this   product .   it   worked   great   for   about   a   month ,   then   i   noticed   it   started   sparking !   initally   i   thought   it   was   because   i   left   it   on   the   high   heat   setting   everytime   i   used   it   however ,   the   sparks   began   occuring   more   often   and   i   could   smell   it   burning .   i   still   gave   it   benefit   of   the   doubt   and   figured   there   was   just   a   faulty   piece   in   the   dryer   and   i   happened   to   be   the   lucky   person   who   bought   it ,   so   i   threw   it   away   and   bought   the   same   hair   dryer   thinking   this   time   it   would   work .   it   worked   great   for   about   two   months   and   then   it   started   throwing   out   blue   sparks   again !   i   have   used   the   dryer   at   my   house   while   on   vacation   out   of   state   and   it   still   sparks   regardless   of   where   i   plug   it   in .   i   hate   to   bad   mouth   any   product   from   remington   because   i   am   a   fan   of   their   other   products ,   but   i   just   don   t   see   how   this   can   just   be   a   coincidence .   when   i   contact   remington ,   i   can   never   get   through   directly   to   someone .   it   s   not   really   worth   trying   to   get   them   to   send   me   a   new   one   i   have   learned   my   lesson   once   and   for   all .   use   at   your   own   risk !
best   blow   dryer   i   have   ever   owned ! ! !   i   have   curly   hair .   after   being   without   a   blow   dryer   for   a   long   time   i   decided   to   by   this   one .   i   love   thats   its   pink   and   a   donation   is   made   for   each   one   sold   but   it   also   is   the   best   blow   dryer   ever .   i   use   the   medium   setting   and   my   shoulder   lenght   hair   is   completely   dry   in   just   a   few   minutes .   then   i   either   straighten   my   hair   with   my   flat   iron   or   add   a   little   leave   in   conditioner   spray   to   wear   it   curly .   its   easy   to   use   and   light   weight   and   doesnt   get   too   hot   and   fry   my   hair .
room   for   improvement   i   love   the   speed   with   which   i   can   dry   my   thick ,   medium   length   hair   and   really   like   having   a   brush   attachment .   br   the   only   complaint   i   have   is   that   the   bristles   of   the   brush   are   so   soft   that   they   flatten   with   the   first   use   and   are   not   at   all   effective   in   separating   my   hair   while   drying   it .   if   they   would   only   make   the   bristles   firmer ,   i   would   give   this   product   5   stars .
great   blow   dryer   i   wondered   whether   it   would   be   worth   the   money   when   i   purchased   this   blow   dryer   a   few   years   ago .   however ,   it   didn   t   take   me   long   to   learn   how   superior   this   blow   dryer   is   to   all   of   the   others   i   have   used .   it   dries   my   hair   faster   than   any   other   blow   dryer .   i   m   not   sure   how ,   but   my   hair   looks   nicer   too .   it   doesn   t   make   that   high   pitched   engine   sound   like   other   driers .   i   like   the   little   red   rubber   tabs   on   the   side .   you   put   it   down   and   it   stays   where   ever   you   put   it .   when   i   go   on   a   trip   and   have   to   use   the   hotel   s   driers ,   i   am   instantly   reminded   of   how   much   better   the   remington   is .   the   only   thing   that   is   a   little   bit   of   a   negative   is   that   it   is   heavier   than   other   blow   dryers .   but ,   it   is   hardly   worth   the   mention .   this   drier   is   well   worth   the   extra   money .
flame   thrower   first   unit   lasted   two   years   and   the   switch   gave   out .   from   reviews   and   comments   online   this   seems   to   be   a   constant   theme .   but ,   since   we   had   the   holes   on   the   wall ,   we   gave   it   another   try .   second   one ,   just   one   one   year ,   and   flames   came   out   of   the   dryer   and   actuallly   singed   hair .   one   year   and   one   month   so   warranty   doesn   t   matter .   on   the   other   hand ,   i   am   not   sure   i   want   more   burnt   hair .   i   will   have   to   find   some   other   solution   to   hair   drying .   the   portable   dryers   we   have ,   some   well   over   20   years   old ,   seem   to   work   when   called   upon .   perhaps   we   have   to   go   back   to   putting   one   in   a   drawer   and   pulling   it   out   as   we   did   for   many   years   before   the   flame   thrower .
basic ,   but   does   the   job   fine   this   hair   dryer   does   exactly   what   it   s   meant   for .   good   quality   product   overall .   the   only   thing   i   m   a   little   unhappy   with   is   the   switch   which   seems   a   tad   cheap   to   me .   slides   a   little   loose   in   the   3   positions ,   but   it   works   fine .   i   would   recommend   this   to   someone .   price   is   right   and   it   s   perfect   for   travel .
broke   but   was   replaced   by   manufacturer   a   month   ago   i   reviewed   this   product   with   the   title ,   a   piece   of   crap   see   below   review   .   after   this   review   i   decided   to   contact   the   remington   online   customer   service   and   sent   them   a   message   with   my   complaint .   shortly   thereafter   i   received   an   email   from   them   asking   me   to   return   the   broken   one   and   they   would   send   a   replacement .   they   sent   the   shipping   box   and   the   label   as   well   and   within   10   days   i   had   a   new   dryer   that   i   have   been   using   since   with   no   problems .   granted   it   has   only   been   a   month   but   i   was   very   impressed   with   remington .   i   just   hope   that   no   one   there   was   injured   when   testing   the   dryer   lol   ...   it   really   did   blow   flames .   obviously   there   was   a   short   which   could   happen   with   any   electrical   product   but   it   was   the   way   that   the   company   responded   that   i   had   to   give   the   rating   of   4   stars   when   previously   i   only   give   it   1 .   i   really   do   like   this   dryer   and   how   my   hair   looks   and   feels   afterwards   which   is   very   different   from   other   dryers   that   are   no   ionic .   plus   it   dries   my   hair   super   fast   without   drying   it   out .   br   br   previous   review   bought   this   dryer   4   months   ago   even   though   i   read   the   bad   reviews   as   well   as   the   good   ones   and   was   concerned   but   figured   it   was   a   good   brand   name .   i   only   use   a   hair   dryer   at   most   2x   wk .   last   night   i   was   using   the   dryer   on   my   wet   hair   and   flames   and   sparks   started   shooting   out   of   it ! ! !   thank   god   my   hair   was   wet   and   didn   t   have   any   flammable   product   in   it .   i   showed   it   to   my   boyfriend   who   suggested   that   i   contact   consumer   affairs   for   remington ,   which   i   just   did .   since   it   has   been   over   30   days   i   can   no   longer   return   the   appliance   to   amazon .   i   have   had   many   hair   dryers   and   most   of   the   time   they   have   just   worn   out   after   a   year   or   2   but   this   was   just   scary .   br   br   1   18   13   almost   1   year   later ...   and   still   working   perfectly .   in   fact ,   i   bought   another   dryer   in   the   interim ,   waiting   for   the   new   remington   and   paid   a   pretty   penny   for   the   new   one .   i   used   both   multiple   times ,   trading   off   one   for   the   other .   i   found   that   i   prefer   the   remington   over   the   other   more   expensive   name   brand   dryer .   the   remington   does   not   leave   my   hair   fly   away   and   seems   to   give   it   a   nice   sheen   is   that   possible   .   it   drys   my   hair   better   and   more   evenly . mington   over   the   other   more   expensive   name   brand   dryer .   the   remington   does   not   leave   my   hair   fly   away   and   seems   to   give   it   a   nice   sheen   is   that   possible   .   it   drys   my   hair   better   and   more   evenly .
great   blow   dryer   i   have   very   thick   and   long   hair   and   after   having   my   old   dryer   for   years ,   the   motor   was   worn   out   and   old .   this   new   dryer   is   a   perfect   size ,   less   bulky   than   my   old   one ,   and   also   very   quiet .   i   don   t   get   ringing   in   my   ears   due   to   the   noise .   it   is   not   very   heavy   and   does   exactly   what   it   is   supposed   to   do .   i   am   very   happy   with   this   product .
conair   great   product   for   22 .   i   like   the   mat   plastic   touch ,   feels   like   a   salon   model .   kind   of   quiet ,   and   comes   with   two   extra   attachments .   a   bit   big   for   my   taste   though .
love   it !   i   am   so   glad   i   found   this   hair   dryer .   i   was   initially   looking   for   one   that   had   the   folding   handle ,   but   was   not   successful   at   the   time .   this   one   is   smaller   than   the   big   bulky   types   and   does   the   same   job ,   just   as   good .   it   s   easier   to   store   being   more   compact   and   to   keep   out   of   the   way ,   even   to   pack   for   travel .   i   ve   had   it   for   a   year   and   still   like   it   and   it   works   as   good   as   the   day   i   got   it .   it   s   not   quiet ,   but   it   s   not   overly   noisy   either   just   sounds   like   a   hair   dryer .
conair   soft   bonnet   hair   dryer   a   bust   this   is   the   most   horrible   hair   dryer   i   have   ever   owned .   the   hose   would   not   stay   connected   to   the   bonnet .   it   kept   slipping   off .   i   have   only   used   the   dryer   one   time .   will   not   use   it   again .   if   the   dryer   was   more   expensive ,   i   would   have   sent   it   back .
super   hair   dryer   i   really   like   this   blow   dryer .   it   has   a   very   strong   motor   and   gets   the   job   done   quickly .   the   price   was   just   right .
just   for   men   i   have   to   be   completely   honest   in   saying   that ,   i   don   t   understand   why   this   hairdryer   is   solely   being   marketed   towards   men .   it   s   a   nice   hairdryer   and   does   the   same   job   like   hundreds   of   other   hairdryers   on   the   market .   outside   of   the   sporty   color   that   may   seem   more   masculine   or   the   fact   that   it   s   inscribed   with   mangroomer   on   the   side   of   it   doesn   t   change   the   functionality   of   the   dryer   itself .   i   would   have   to   say   that   this   is   psychological   advertising   at   its   best !   i   am   a   woman   and   my   favorite   color   in   the   whole   wide   world   is   red   which   attracted   me   to   this   hairdryer   plus   i   needed   a   new   one   so   i   was   very   happy   to   get   this   one !   my   husband   thinks   the   dryer   is   ugly .   he   has   never   used   a   hairdryer   on   his   hair   because   he   wears   his   hair   close   to   the   scalp   or   completely   bald .   i   will   admit   that   this   is   one   of   the   best   hairdryers   that   i   have   ever   used .   it   is   more   powerful   than   the   hairdryer   that   i   just   recently   tossed   into   the   trash .   it   drys   my   hair   quickly   unlike   my   other   hairdryer .   it   is   also   very   sturdy .   i   have   accidentally   dropped   the   hairdryer   on   several   occasions   and   there   is   still   not   one   dent ,   ding   or   scratch   on   the   mangroomer   at   all .   it   is   definitely   built   like   a   man   lol !
mangroomer   it   is ! !   i   think   they   are   calling   it   a   mangroomer   since   it   looks   really   cool .   the   grip   is   nice   and   feels   solid   to   hold .   the   hairdryer   itself   does   the   job   well   and   dries   the   hair   fast .   it   has   various   heat ,   speed   settings ,   a   cool   air   button .   i   loved   the   power   on   this   and   it   isn   t   too   loud   at   the   same   time .   you   can   also   use   the   attachment   but   for   me   it   worked   well   without   it   as   well .   the   red   and   black   combo   really   looks   nice .   i   do   recommend   this   hairdryer   for   the   price   and   the   power   it   delivers !
worth   every   penny ! ! ! !   this   dryer   is   the   dryer   of   all   hair   dryers !   i   have   long   thick   hair   african   american   and   i   have   never   had   a   perm .   all   natural .   i   have   tried   different   hair   dyers   and   all   of   the   comb   attachments   would   break   or   come   off   while   i   am   trying   to   dry   my   hair .   not   only   is   this   product   worth   every   penny ,   but   i   love   the   resin   pick ,   the   color   of   the   product   and   the   comb   hasn   t   slid   off   yet ! ! ! ! ! !   i   plan   on   buying   another   one   soon   and   if   you   have   hair   that   is   thick   or   you   are   of   mixed   race ,   this   comb   is   great !   the   only   con   is   that   the   dryer   is   kind   of   loud   but   trust   me ,   you   won   t   care   once   you   put   it   to   your   hair .   the   price   is   great   from   this   seller   and   i   received   the   product   in   a   week !   very   happy .
t3   featherweight   love   this   blowdryer .   it   is   a   bit   louder   than   my   chi   nano   and   isn   t   as   powerful   but   it   doesn   t   seem   to   effect   the   drying   time .   also   i   would   love   for   it   to   have   a   stand   but   no   biggie  
the   best   blow   dryer   i   have   ever   owned !   this   is   hands   down   the   best   dryer   i   have   ever   owned !   this   is   the   only   dryer   i   have   ever   used   that   allows   me   to   finish   my   whole   head   without   it   stopping ,   my   other   dryers   stop   at   least   twice   to   cool   down   before   i   finish !   the   comb   attachment   had   me   sort   of   skeptical   because   my   hair   is   coarse   and   kinky   but   this   comb   attachment   works   like   a   dream   it   literally   glides   through   my   hair   better   than   any   other   comb   attachment   of   any   dryer   i   have   ever   used ,   i   get   so   angry   just   thinking   about   the   fact   that   this   dryer   has   been   around   for   years   and   i   had   no   idea !   this   type   of   hair   dryer   is   exactly   what   my   hair   needed   and   i   just   found   out   about   it !   i   will   never   purchase   another   hair   dryer   other   than   this   one   again !
great   hairdryer   this   hairdryer   is   perfect .   no   more   hunting   for   the   hairdryer ,   it   s   right   there   on   the   wall ,   just   like   in   a   hotel   bathroom .   i   ve   only   had   it   for   a   month   but   so   far   i   am   very   pleased .
pretty   darn   good !   my   previous   blow   dryer   was   an   ionic   one   and   it   lasted   about   10   years .   i   don   t   remember   the   brand ,   but   it   was   really   expensive   and   high   end .   i   think   it   was   somewhere   around   175   new .   so ,   the   other   day   the   heat   finally   went   out   on   it   and   i   needed   to   replace   it .   this   time ,   no   question ,   anything   other   than   an   ionic   simply   won   t   do .   anyways ,   i   found   this   one   and   just   used   it   for   the   first   time   with   a   completely   wet   head   and   i   am   so   impressed ,   i   can   t   even   believe   it ! !   i   m   not   sure   if   the   ion   charges   on   my   old   dryer   had   gradually   worn   out ,   or   if   the   technology   now   is   just   that   much   better   but   i   couldn   t   be   happier .   it   took   all   of   10   minutes   to   completely   dry   and   style   my   hair   and   it   looks   amazing ,   with   very   little   frizz   and   enhanced   the   shine   too .   my   other   blow   dryer   had   been   taking   me   more   like   15   minutes .   this   remington   does   have   greater   watts   power   too ,   but   even   on   the   lower   setting ,   my   hair   was   getting   dry   faster   and   styling   perfectly .   i   should   also   mention   the   design   is   really   neat   looking   too .   it   does   not   feel   as   heavy   quality   as   my   other   one   and   the   precision   extra   part   felt   like   it   was   made   kind   of   cheap .   but ,   of   course !   my   other   one   was   about   four   times   more   expensive .   as   long   as   this   one   doesn   t   break   anytime   soon ,   i   am   sure   i   will   be   very   happy   with   it !   no   need   for   me   to   add   the   benefits   of   the   ionic   vs   the   regular   blow   dryer ,   you   can   find   that   info   just   about   anywhere   on   the   net   .   i   completely   recommend   this   product !
started   sparking   after   several   months   of   use   i   would   have   rated   this   hairdryer   higher ,   perhaps   even   5   stars   because   it   works   really   well   and   my   hair   has   been   healthy   and   shiny   even   though   i   don   t   use   styling   products   on   my   hair ,   but ....   it   has   started   making   a   popping   sound   and   shooting   out   sparks   at   me ! !   i   have   never   had   a   hair   dryer   do   this .   it   seems   quite   dangerous .   today   i   my   left   index   finger   feels   like   it   got   a   slight   burn   on   it   after   i   used   the   dryer .   it   sparked   once   a   few   days   ago ,   but   today   is   was   much   worse   and   made   the   popping   sound   quite   a   few   times .   i   will   have   to   go   out   and   buy   a   new   one   today   and   i   m   sure   there   will   be   no   customer   support   from   remington ,   so   i   m   not   going   to   bother .   i   wouldn   t   buy   this   one   again   unfortunately   because   it   did   not   last   nearly   long   enough   before   it   started   to   malfunction .
hair   dryer   good   travel   dryer .   small ,   light   and   worked   well   for   our   three   week   trip   to   italy .   only   needed   the   outlet   adapter .   did   not   need   a   heavy   converter .   still   using   for   travel .
its   alright ,   but   it   could   be   better   when   i   first   came   across   this   product   i   thought   this   looked   gfeat   and   i   wanted   buy   it .   whwn   i   received   it   in   the   mail ,   i   still   thought   it   looked   great   but   it   could   definifintely   use   some   improving .   the   case   itself   at   the   top   left   corner   of   my   phone   comes   apart   sometimes   and   i   havent   even   dropped   my   phone ! ! !
love   love   this   dryer ! ! !   what   a   huge   difference   this   dryer   has   made   on   my   hair   with   only   using   it   one   time ! !   my   hair   has   no   more   frizz ! !   i   m   so   happy  
works   for   me   i   got   this   hair   dryer   as   a   gift   for   my   daughter ,   especially   since   she   would   leave   her   home   to   borrow   mine ,   which   has   a   similar   style .   she   loves   the   results   and   tells   me   she   thanks   me   every   time   someone   compliments   her   on   her   hair .   my   daughter   and   i   both   like   the   ability   to   hold   the   hair   dryer   as   a   comb   or   brush   for   drying   and   styling .
greatest   yet !   the   drier   is   great .   i   don   t   usually   review   items   but   this   drier   is   the   best   one   i   ve   ever   used .   for   the   price   23.66   ,   it   far   exceeded   my   expectations .   although   i   had   never   heard   of   this   brand   before ,   i   was   pleasantly   surprised   by   the   quality .   it   has   very   easy   to   use   speed   and   heat   settings ,   the   low   setting   is   just   right   for   my   fine   hair ,   but   still   gets   hot   at   that   speed   unlike   the   conair   i   was   using   .   it   s   not   heavy ,   the   ion   technology   seems   to   be   working ..   my   hair   dries   much   faster ,   with   less   frizz ,   higher   shine   and   so   far   with   less   damage   to   my   hair .   results   from   this   drier   don   t   even   compare   to   my   previous   conair   255r .   also   way   better   than   a   bed   head   drier   i   bought   a   few   years   back .   buy   this   one .
excellent   product   the   pictures   description   did   not   indicate   that   it   can   be   wall   mounted .   i   mounted   it   on   the   wall   with   screws   i   found   a   wall   stud   for   one   screw   location   and   it   is   excellent .   br   don   t   mount   it   vertically .   you   should   mount   it ,   with   the   slot   at   a   45   degree   angle   and   not   perpendicular .   this   way ,   your   dryer   can   be   rotated   around   its   vertical   axis   so   that   you   can   easy   adjust   to   your   preference   of   distance   from   the   wall   etc ..   br   br   it   is   unfortunate ,   that   this   product   is   currently   unavailable .   i   hope   the   seller   would   notice   this   review   and   offer   more ..   i   know   i   will   be   installing   this   in   3   more   of   my   bath   rooms ,   as   soon   as   they   become   available .
awesome   this   blower   dryer   is   the   bomb .   it   dried   my   hair   super   fast   there   are   three   heat   settings   and   a   cool   down   setting ,   very   21st   centuary .   shipping   was   fast   too .   i   love   the   compact   size   it   s   not   too   big   or   too   small .   and   as   far   as   blow   dryers   go   it   s   not   nosy   at   all .   i   can   finally   blow   dry   my   hair   with   out   disturbing   the   nieghbors .
hairdryer   i   like   the   size   and   sound   of   this   hairdryer   nice   and   compact   on   the   wall   the   first   one   only   lasted   15   months   hope   this   lasts   longer   i   have   had   to   replace   my   hairdryer   twice   and   my   husband   is   still   using   the   first   one   he   ordered   which   is   probably   4   5   years   old .   use   on   daily   basis .
larger   in   size   than   expected   this   is   a   4   star   product   but   i   gave   it   a   3   star   as   it   is   a   travel   hair   dryer .   it   should   be   much   smaller   than   it   is   even   with   the   cool   shot   button .   like   many   women ,   i   need   all   the   room   i   can   have   in   my   luggage   for   other   things   especially   that   most   hotels   b   b   s   have   hair   dryers   in   them   though   w   o   a   cool   shot   button   ofcourse   .   it   is   not   a   critical   item   in   travel .   it   should   be   much   smaller   in   size   with   the   same   quality   cool   shot .   it   s   2012   this   shouldn   t   be   difficult   technology .
hair   blower   very   nice   hair   blowers .   easy   to   attach   to   bathroom   wall .   makes   it   very   handy   to   use   and   there   is   no   need   for   a   place   to   store   when   you   are   done .
poor   design ,   very   flimsy   this   dryer   can   t   compare   at   all   to   past   hair   dryers .   it   is   hard   to   adjust   and   very   noisy .   it   took   me   a   few   attempts   to   finally   find   a   way   to   sit   under   this   dryer   without   it   knocking   out   my   rollers   or   making   me   sit   in   very   uncomfortable   positions .   hard   to   adjust   on   my   own ,   had   to   have   my   husband   fix   it   for   me .
best   buy   beauty   great   customer   service   i   bought   this   t3   blow   dryer   over   a   year   ago   and   just   this   morning   had   a   failure   with   it .   i   have   loved   this   dryer   and   the   technology   it   uses .   i   contacted   best   buy   beauty   this   morning   and   they   are   replacing   my   dryer .   great   customer   service !   thank   you   jennifer   cavanagh
pretty   powerful   dryer   this   product   is   definitely   high   powered .   it   does   not   get   as   hot   as   i   would   like   but   the   blowing   power   is   almost   too   much ,   i   have   long   hair   so   if   i   use   it   on   high   it   does   tend   to   blow   so   hard   it   knots   my   hair .   i   do   like   the   attachments   i   use   both   of   them   frequently   and   with   the   attachments   on   the   blowing   power   is   not   enough   to   tangle   my   hair   so   i   would   recommend   using   the   attachments ,   or   using   the   dryer   on   the   low   setting   because   it   works   well .   i   love   the   twist   on   and   off   lid   by   the   motor   because   it   is   easy   to   clean .   the   motor   does   get   a   funny   scent   if   it   is   used   for   a   longer   period   of   time   but   that   might   be   expected   because   my   dryer   is   only   about   2   weeks   old .   the   dryer   also   isn   t   very   loud   so   that   is   another   plus .   overall   it   is   a   good   dryer   and   i   feel   confident   in   recommending   it ,   plus   the   color   is   amazing   it   stands   out .
gets   the   job   done   after   having   my   previous   blow   dryer   for   almost   6   years ,   it   finally   died   on   me .   i   did   a   bit   on   research   on   some   blow   dryers   and   to   be   honest   this   one   caught   my   eye   only   because   the   color   lol   i   read   some   of   the   reviews   and   went   ahead   and   purchased   it .   it   was   suppose   to   arrive   on   a   friday   and   i   recieved   it   on   monday   that   was   a   plus ,   after   usuing   it   i   loved   it ,   it   was   light   weight ,   small   and   came   with   a   diffuser   and   another   gadget .   i   have   long   thick   hair   and   my   hair   was   dry   in   less   than   15   minutes   and   it   was   soft   and   had   less   frizz   ! !   love   this   product   !
looks   cool ,   blows   hot   i   love   the   look   of   this   hair   dryer ,   so   i   guess   they   knew   what   they   were   doing   when   they   marketed   it   to   men .   i   m   not   a   frequent   hair   dryer   user ,   but   it   s   always   good   to   have   one   around .   this   one   is   manly   enough   that   you   ll   look   cool   using   it ,   and   can   leave   it   laying   around   without   your   date   thinking   you   have   a   live   in   girlfriend .   br   br   did   i   just   say   that   br   br   and   yes ,   i   suppose   i   should   mention ,   it   really   does   dry   your   hair .   now   can   we   go   back   to   talking   about   how   cool   it   looks  
excellent   i   ve   always   wanted   a   compact   hair   dryer   that   i   could   have   on   the   wall .   this   is   one   is   the   perfect   one   since   i   don   t   have   a   big   storage   area .   it   makes   my   life   much   more   organized   and   i   just   love   it .   it   works   perfect !  
never   worked   bought   this   for   my   aunt   as   a   gift .   she   was   very   excited   to   use   it   for   the   1st   time   and   the   damn   thing   never   worked .   so   i   had   to   get   the   dryer   back   and   mail   it   for   a   refund   ... not   happy   at   all
great   hairdryer ... using   for   almost   3   years   now !   i   first   bought   this   because   the   gym   i   went   to   had   this   hair   dryer   and   i   always   liked   how   it   dried   my   hair .   i   also   figured   people   use   the   hair   dryers   all   day   long   at   the   gym   so   they   must   last .   so   when   i   was   in   the   market   for   a   new   hair   dryer   and   decided   to   buy   the   same   one .   ive   used   this   everyday   for   the   past   2.5   years   and   still   works   great .   the   lint   catcher   is   easy   to   clean   out   and   has   good   excellent   heat   and   drying   power .   when   this   one   someday   wears   out   i   will   be   buying   the   exact   same   one   again .
unhappy   customer   the   first   two   times   i   used   this   dryer   was   ok .   now   every   time   i   use   it   the   motors   sounds   like   it   is   bumpi   g   something   and   about   to .   low   up .   i   was   so   excited   to   get   this   dryer   but   instead   i   am   very   disappointed .
love   it ,   but   a   warning !   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   in   january   of   2010   and   it   s   been   just   great .   however ,   let   me   warn   you   that   if   it   starts   to   make   a   low   metallic   or   grinding   noise ,   stop   using   it !   i   tried   it   once   more   after   hearing   that   and   the   thing   started   vibrating   wildly   and   made   a   terrible   noise   as   if   it   were   about   to   fly   apart   in   my   hand .   i   unplugged   it   just   in   time .   maybe   you   won   t   have   this   problem   if   yours   doesn   t   see   much   travel .   mine   was   in   and   out   of   suitcases   so   that   may   have   contributed .
worth   the   money   bought   this   the   other   day   and   was   blown   away   by   the   power .   the   attachments   fit   nice   and   snug   and   it   dries   in   less   time   than   my   20   one   i   had .   i   definitely   recommend   this   hair   dryer .   my   hair   never   got   frizzy   like   it   does   with   some   other   dryers .   the   hair   dryer   that   i   just   replaced   with   this   one ,   the   attachments   used   to   fall   off   all   the   time   and   it   was   frustrating .   i   also   used   to   hit   the   buttons   during   drying   and   shut   it   off   accidentally .   not   with   this   one .   the   buttons   stay   in   their   position   easily ,   and   the   attachments   stay   on   and   fit   really   nice .   i   think   this   dryer   is   going   to   last   a   long   time .
not   just   for   the   guys ! !   the   mangroomer   arrived   a   few   weeks   ago   and   3   of   us   decided   to   give   it   a   try .   here   s   what   we   found   br   br   my   husband   has   very   short   hair   and   only   uses   a   hairdryer   on   occasion .   he   thought   the   mangroomer   felt   good   and   solid   in   his   hands   light   weight   and   dries   his   hair   no   different   than   any   other   hair   dryer .   br   br   my   son   used   the   mangroomer   for   a   few   days .   he   has   longer   hair   about   3   inches   long   ,   just   over   the   ears .   he   traded   off   between   a   smaller ,   cheaper   hairdryer   to   the   mangroomer   and   thought   it   was   less   noisy   than   the   cheaper ,   older   model   he   is   used   too .   he   thought   the   dryer   was   sleek   looking ,   more   manly   than   the   girl   hairdryer   he   has   been   using .   the   different   speeds   and   temperature   settings   were   a   plus   considering   he   s   never   had   the   choice .   br   br   lastly   myself ,   i   have   shoulder   length   hair   that   has   a   course   texture .   i   use   a   hairdryer   every   day .   the   mangroomer   looks   and   feels   manly .   in   comparison   to   my   1   year   old   remington   hairdryer ,   the   main   handle   is   wider   and   less   fitted   to   the   hand .   the   buttons   do   not   get   in   the   way   in   comparison   to   other   hairdryers   that   place   them   front   and   center .   the   buttons   on   the   mangroomer   are   on   the   side ,   which   never   seem   to   get   in   the   way .   the   ion   button   is   located   on   the   side   of   the   barrel   with   a   cool   blue   button   indicator .   with   or   without   the   ionic   button   i   felt   the   dryer   was   the   same .   a   huge   plus   to   this   hairdryer   is   the   speed   in   which   it   dries   your   hair .   it   pushes   a   lot   of   air   to   dry   quickly .   another   important   thing   to   note   is   in   comparison   to   my   hairdryer   the   air   does   not   get   as   hot ,   personally   i   think   this   is   why   the   hair   feels   softer   and   more   manageable   than   when   i   use   the   other   hairdryer .   i   actually   noticed   a   difference   in   the   softness   of   my   hair .   it   seems   absurd   to   think   a   hairdryer   can   do   this   but   as   a   person   who   dries   her   hair   daily ,   i   won   t   be   going   back   to   the   other   hairdryer ,   even   if   this   one   is   built   bigger   for   a   man .
like   it !   like   the   oster   hair   dryer   a   lot .   it   is   larger   than   my   old   one ,   but   a   lot   more   powerful .   great   choice !
sorry   men ,   but   the   woman   in   your   life   will   love   it   too !   ...   and   if   you   re   not   careful ,   she   just   might   steal   it .   br   br   this   mangroomer   hair   dryer   for   men   dries   my   shoulder   length   hair   faster   than   any   other   hair   dryer   i   ve   every   tried   less   than   five   minutes   and   it   does   it   without   over   drying   my   hair .   i   didn   t   need   the   attachment ,   so   i   can   t   say   how   well   it   works ,   but   this   beauty   of   a   hair   dryer   is   now   in   my   drawer .   oh   sure ,   my   husband   can   use   it   whenever   he   wants ,   but   this   is   now   mine   !
all   the   features   of   a   lady   s   hair   dryer ,   with   a   tool   belt   persona .   this   is   a   sturdy ,   high   quality   hair   dryer .   it   has   all   the   features   that   my   own   hair   dryer   comes   with .   it   has   multiple   heat   settings ,   multiple   speed   settings ,   a   cool   blast   button ,   an   ionization   button   you   can   toggle   on   and   off ,   and   a   removable   end   cap   you   can   use   to   focus   the   airflow .   it   has   good   speed ,   nice   heat ,   and   durability .   it   doesn   t   overheat   and   it   dries   hair   very   quickly ,   even   longer   hair   like   mine .   the   only   thing   about   this   hair   dryer   that   makes   it   a   mangroomer   is   its   appearance .   it   looks   like   a   power   tool ,   so   no   man   will   be   embarrassed   to   hang   it   in   his   bathroom   where   guests   might   see   it .   in   my   home ,   my   teens   are   using   it .   it   s   a   great   hair   dryer ,   for   men   or   women .
ok ,   but   not   great   this   hair   dryer   works   pretty   well ,   it   is   decent   for   the   price ,   but   not   great .   still   leaves   my   hair   fairly   frizzy ,   regardless   of   what   settings   i   choose .   that   said   it   is   not   very   expensive   as   far   as   hair   dryers   go ,   so   it   s   probably   on   par   for   the   price .
my   favorite   hair   dryer ,   yet !   i   was   looking   for   a   lightweight ,   high   power   hair   dryer   with   lots   of   features   high   low ,   warm   hot ,   cold   shot   ...   and   this   one   surpassed   expectations .   it   is   very   light   and   sleek ,   making   it   easy   to   manipulate   and   switch   hands   sides   of   head .   it   is   also   very   powerful   without   being   overwhelming .   it   dries   my   thick   head   of   hair   faster   than   my   previous   3   dryers   did .   i   can   t   think   of   any   criticism ,   except   a   curl   diffuser   attachment   would   have   been   nice .
perfect   i   bought   this   as   a   gift   and   it   worked   out   amazingly !   she   loves   the   product .   you   would   never   guess   that   you   could   buy   such   a   quality   hair   dryer   at   such   a   cheap   price !
takes   some   getting   used   to .   takes   a   few   minutes   to   warm   up   and   the   full   force   setting   creates   tangles   in   my   hair   but   i   am   working   with   it   and   getting   used   to   it .   the   medium   setting   seems   to   work   well   with   fine   hair ,   the   jury   is   still   out   on   this   product .
stay   away   from   t3 ! ! ! !   my   experiences   with   this   hairdryer   and   this   company   are   x4 .   i   purchased   two   sets   of   two   hair   dryers   for   my   daughters   for   christmas .   each   set   had   a   travel   size   and   a   full   size   hair   dryer .   they   were   200 .   for   each   set .   at   the   time   i   made   this   purchase ,   reviews   were   pretty   good   and   the   warranty   for   each   hair   dryer   was   for   4   years .   within   6   months ,   both   travel   size   dryers   were   no   longer   working .   they   smelled   of   burning   wires ,   and   were   very   hot !   the   company   refused   to   replace   them ,   saying   they   no   longer   made   this   particular   model .   before   the   end   of   the   1st   year ,   one   of   the   regular   size   dryers   had   gone   bad   as   well   same   hot ,   burning   smell   ,   and   the   other   before   15   months   was   up .   comapny   wouldn   t   return   a   phone   call   or   answer   an   email .   i   tried   many   times   for   3   months ,   finally   giving   up   and   calling   the   seller   qvc   .   i   really   didn   t   expect   them   to   do   anything   after   15   months ,   and   they   didn   t   ,   but   i   wanted   to   warn   them   about   the   company   not   standing   behind   the   warranty   that   they   used   in   their   sales   pitch .   they   are   still   selling   them ,   so   this   warning   is   for   potential   buyers   from   anywhere .   don   t   buy   t3   brand   products ! ! !
disappointing   even   for   a   cheap   hairdryer   i   bought   this   conair   hair   dryer   to   replace   my   old   conair ,   which   i   had   for   4   years .   unfortunately ,   it   looks   like   the   quality   of   conair   s   products   has   gone   downhill   since   my   previous   purchase .   this   hair   dryer   has   a   comfort   touch   coating ,   which   i   initially   thought   was   very   nice .   it   feels   soft   to   the   touch   rather   than   the   slick   plastic   of   the   older   models .   but   after   just   a   couple   of   weeks   of   use ,   the   coating   started   bubbling   and   peeling   off   in   the   area   where   i   hold   the   hair   dryer .   i   ve   only   had   it   for   a   month   and   a   half ,   and   the   outer   coating   looks   positively   pathetic   already .   i   also   don   t   like   the   settings   on   this   model   there   are   only   two   speed   settings ,   with   the   lower   one   being   barely   on .   the   high   setting   is   okay ,   but   it   does   make   me   feel   like   i   m   in   a   wind   tunnel   at   times .   this   hair   dryer   has   some   pros   it   gets   quite   hot ,   and   it   s   fairly   lightweight .   so   if   you   don   t   mind   your   hair   dryer   looking   like   it   s   constantly   recovering   from   a   bad   sunburn   after   a   month   of   use ,   perhaps   you   ll   like   it .
super   bargain !   perfect   size ,   power ,   and   light   in   weight ..   best   of   all   great   price ..   i   couldnt   ask   for   more   br   i   use   it   eveyday   1st   i   though   the   power   was   not   enough ..   but   i   was   wrong   this   little   br   dryer   packs   a   punch ... !   its   so   i   bought   another   one   to   share   with   friend   as   a   gift   lol   br   and   the   price ..   you   cant   even   find   1   this   low
mostly   ok   i   have   curly   hair   i   use   the   hair   dryer   to   straighten .   the   nozzle   is   too   wide   the   result   is   frizzy   hair .   they   need   to   make   a   narrower   nozzle   for   straightening !
great   little   dryer !   we   first   encountered   this   dryer   in   a   hotel   room .   my   wife   used   it   and   immediately   fell   in   love   with   it .   small ,   but   it   packs   a   punch .   plenty   heat   and   plenty   air   volume .   she   simply   had   to   have   one   since   her   dryer   at   home   was   getting   sick .   i   checked   with   amazon   and   found   the   identical   model   we   had   used   at   the   hotel .   she   loves   it   and   it   has   performed   flawlessly   for   several   months   now .   we   highly   recommend   this   item .
love   my   new   conair   dryer   i   read   a   lot   of   negative   reviews   on   this   dryer .   i   love   it !   it   s   lighter   weight   than   the   older   model   and   low   noise .   drys   my   hair   fast   without   being   so   hot   that   it   burns   my   hair ! !
great   dryer !   this   lightweight   dryer   simply   does   the   job   with   no   fuss   plain   and   simple   nothing   complicated   you   plug   it   in ,   turn   it   on ,   dry   your   hair   ...   done .   bought   an   extra   for   the   guest   bathroom .
good   it   is   quite   good   in   shape   and   it   is   convenient   to   use   as   it   is   not   so   big .   the   power   of   it   is   really   nice
great   dryer ,   very   powerful   i   bought   this   dryer   to   replace   my   revlon   rv544   1875   watt   tourmaline   ionic   lightweight   dryer ,   which   started   smoking   and   sparking   after   less   than   a   year   of   use .   the   john   frieda   is   much   more   powerful ,   and   overall   a   great   product .   it   is   so   strong   that   i   can   use   the   low   setting   on   hot   heat   to   get   my   long   hair   mid   back   length   dry   in   only   a   few   minutes   5   10   .   the   high   setting   is   very ,   very   powerful .   it   is   relatively   lightweight   too .   it   has   a   nice   look   the   silver   and   purple   together   look   sleek .   the   cord   is   very   long .   i   would   definitely   recommend .
not   a   flame   thrower   i   contend   that   a   real   manly   hair   dryer   would   actually   shoot   fire   into   your   hair   to   dry   it .   but ,   even   though   this   hair   dryer   does   not   do   that   it   is   still   a   good   product .   it   has   plenty   of   heat   and   power ,   runs   fairly   quiet   and   has   all   the   usual   features   high   and   low   speed ,   warm   and   hot   heat ,   a   cool   air   burst   button ,   and   even   ionic   technology   for   what   that   is   worth   ,   etc .   and   it   has   an   attachment   for   focusing   the   drying   air .   br   br   it   is   marketed   to   men   but   in   the   end   it   is   still   just   a   hair   dryer ,   red   and   black   and   sleek   so   really   not   any   less   feminine   than   any   other   dryer .   it   does   not   shoot   manly   flame   or   melt   women   who   touch   it   but   if   you   want   to   dry   style   your   hair   it   should   work   just   fine .
attractively   designed   and   very   functional   i   like   this   product .   as   someone   who   regards   his   hair   as   stuff   that   sits   on   top   of   my   head   and   needs   to   be   kept   in   some   semblance   of   tidiness ,   a   grooming   product   is   of   little   interest   to   me .   i   rarely   use   a   hair   dryer   when   i   am   away   from   home   and   it   s   very   much   a   matter   of   if   it   s   there   i   ll   use   it   if   it   isn   t ,   then   that   s   what   a   towel   is   for .   br   br   the   mangroomer   is   a   pleasant   surprise .   the   bright   red   and   black   design   is   appealing   clean ,   bold   and   well   shaped .   it   looks   good   and   feels   good .   i   liked   the   solid   construction   and   the   firmness   of   the   controls .   most   of   the   features   go   way   beyond   my   needs .   i   still   don   t   know   what   all   the   ionization   stuff   means   all   i   want   to   do   is   dry   my   hair   quickly   and   have   it   feel   good .   the   mangroomer   meets   my   basic   needs   in   this   regard .   br   br   the   slightly   higher   than   average   price   doesn   t   seem   to   me   to   be   excessive   and   the   design   makes   it   worth   a   few   extra   dollars .   it   is   definitely   more   attractive   than   all   the   standard   bathroom   beige   and   blandness .   i   did   not   expect   to   actually   enjoy   a   hair   dryer .   summary   function   good   enough ,   quality   high   enough   design   a   nice   extra
unfortunately   did   not   last   i   did   really   like   this   hairdryer   i   bought   it   and   it   worked   well ,   was   not   too   noisy ,   had   some   good   power .   but   after   less   than   a   month   using   it   3   4   times   per   week   for   15   minutes ,   it   just   suddenly   died   and   no   amount   of   resuscitation   would   bring   it   back   to   life !   fortunately   amazon   gave   me   a   full   refund   including   shipping   i   don   t   know   if   it   was   just   a   defective   one   or   if   it   is   a   common   problem   with   this   hair   dryer   but   that   was   the   end   of   that .   i   then   went   nuts   on   a   100.00   salon   hair   dryer   and   am   quite   happy   now .
conair   soft   bonnet   hair   dryer   i   have   had   conair   soft   bonnet   hair   dryers   in   the   past   with   great   success .   this   one   performs   ok   with   the   one   exception   that   the   bonnet   is   not   as   large   as   in   previous   products .   i   have   long   hair   and   i   use   large   rollers .   i   find   that   getting   the   bonnet   over   these   rollers   is   a   little   more   difficult .   i   also   have   to   put   a   towel   around   the   back   of   my   neck   to   avoid   excessive   heat   near   the   hose   connection .
i   agree   with   rosa .   i   also   ordered   the   silver   bird   2000w   turbo   hair   dryer   at   the   end   of   january   2012   but   was   sent   a   black   bird   2000w   hair   dryer   instead .   it   was   obvious   someone   stuck   the   black   bird   hair   dryer   in   a   plastic   bag   that   was   sealed   with   regular   scotch   tape   and   had   a   small   label   with   a   bar   code   and   a   description   for   the   silver   bird   dryer .   as   soon   as   i   received   it ,   i   contacted   amazon   s   customer   service   via   an   online   chat   and   told   them   they   sent   me   the   wrong   item .   i   was   sent   a   link   for   a   ups   return   label ,   which   i   printed   out .   i   asked   the   rep   if   they   could   arrange   for   ups   to   pick   the   package   up   since   i   live   in   a   very   rural   area ,   and   they   were   responsible   for   the   fulfillment   and   shipping   of   the   product .   i   was   told   that   i   would   have   to   find   a   ups   drop   off   point   myself .   it   was   very   frustrating   dealing   with   the   online   chat   rep .   i   tracked   the   return   of   the   package   to   amazon   and   waited   for   my   refund .   six   business   days   after   they   received   the   hair   dryer ,   i   still   didn   t   see   a   refund   to   my   credit   card .   this   time   i   checked   the   box   asking   for   one   of   amazon   s   customer   service   reps   to   call   me ,   which   they   did ,   immediately .   this   time ,   my   experience   with   customer   service   rep   2   was   excellent .   the   gentleman   who   helped   me   out   was   a   true   pro .   he   researched   my   transaction   and   issued   a   credit   to   my   account ,   which   hit   the   next   day .   i   would   never   order   anything   from   newvo   beauty   again .   fortunately ,   i   received   excellent   service   from   amazon   s   telephone   reps .   beware   of   newvo   beauty .   i   don   t   believe   their   outstanding   ratings ,   either .
excellent   value   i   ve   never   heard   of   a   hair   dryer   just   for   men   before ,   but   we   ignored   that   part   anyway !   this   hairdryer   works   just   fine   for   women   too .   i   love   the   colors ,   black   and   red   and   the   accessory   attachment   works   great .   i   would   definitely   recommend   this   hair   dryer   for   men   or   women .   it   worked   well ,   looks   nice   in   the   bathroom   and   is   a   good   value .
a   good   hairdryer   for   any   head   of   hair   first ,   i   am   a   woman   and   i   got   this   hairdryer   for   my   own   use   my   hubby   is   bald   .   the   mangroomer   1680xl   6   did   a   good   job   drying   my   long ,   thick   hair ,   although   not   any   faster   than   my   old   dryer .   things   i   like   about   it   adjustable   heat   settings   and   the   attachable   diffuser .   it   is   bigger   and   slightly   heavier   than   my   old   drier ,   but   has   a   good   rubber   grip ,   quiet   motor ,   and   a   fun   bright   color   scheme .   i   tried   it   with   the   ionic   setting   on   and   with   it   off   and   found   no   difference   in   the   look   of   my   hair   with   either .
either   gender   will   likely   find   this   a   great   hairdryer   the   mangroomer   aspect   is   more   of   a   marketing   thing   than   any   realistic   specification   for   this   hairdryer .   my   wife   loves   this   hairdryer   and   uses   it   all   the   time   too .   it   pumps   out   plenty   of   heat   on   the   highest   setting .   there   are   numerous   options   for   temperature   settings .   i   ve   never   needed   it ,   but   i   tried   the   cold   air   blast   feature .   this   apparently   sets   your   hair   after   it   has   been   styled   i   don   t   really   understand   that   process ,   but   if   that   s   important   to   you   the   feature   does   just   what   it   says .   i   found   that   the   hairdryer   volume   while   running   is   pretty   acceptable   not   sure   if   i   m   alone   on   this ,   but   i   hate   really   loud   hair   dryers   .   the   design   is   attractive   and   i   guess   a   little   manlier   than   the   standard   hairdryer   i   don   t   know ,   grasping   for   reasons   why   this   is   a   mangroomer   specifically ,   but   yeah   it   looks   pretty   cool   and   not   feminine .   but   i   think   you   d   have   to   be   pretty   insecure   to   be   weirded   out   using   a   feminine   hairdryer   anyway .   i   think   the   negative   ion   stuff   is   hogwash ,   but   hey   i   m   not   a   hair   scientist .   bottom   line   this   hairdryer   makes   wet   hair   dry .
my   hairdryer   has   more   horsepower   than   your   hairdryer ...   i   did   laugh   at   the   target   branding   to   the   male   population   for   this   mangroomer   i   would   like   have   been   in   the   boardroom   when   that   product   concept   was   being   reviewed .   i   guess   they   felt   this   was   an   under   served   market   even   though   the   total   available   market   tam   for   men   is   probably   much   smaller   than   the   women   s   market   when   considering   that   a   there   are   alot   more   bald   men   than   women ,   b   alot   of   men   barely   comb   there   hair   so   they   certainly   don   t   blowdry   it ,   and   c   the   wife   s   hairdryer   is   already   sitting   there   if   needed .   but ,   if   you   want   a   manly   hairdryer   then   i   guess   this   fits   the   bill .   it   does   have   manly   color   evokes   feelings   of   a   red   corvette .   it   is   substantial   weight   and   feels   good   in   the   hands .   it   appears   to   have   extra   horsepower   to   blow   hair   in   a   manly   fashion   and   it   has   lots   of   speeds   to   fiddle   with .   in   my   usage   i   actually   found   it   to   be   a   good   hairdryer   it   does   the   job   blowing   my   short   hair   around   any   which   way   i   chose .   but ,   since   my   wife   has   a   hairdryer   to   be   honest   i   don   t   quite   have   the   bathroom   real   estate   available   to   store   two   hairdryers .   overall ,   i   give   it   four   stars .   a   quality   product   but   a   bit   high   on   the   price   value   when   considering   that   there   are   other   serviceable   hairdryers   that   cost   less .   also   in   terms   of   necessity   factor   for   married   guys   not   sure   you   want   a   second   hairdryer   in   the   bathroom .   but   if   i   was   a   single   guy   with   a   red   corvette   and   fabio   hair   and   i   had   to   have   a   hairdryer   in   my   bathroom   then   i   guess   this   would   be   the   one .
great   blow   dryer   the   only   reason   i   can   see   for   this   being   called   a   mangroomer   is   the   colors   obviously   and   the   shorter   cord   than   say   regular   hair   dryers .   i   nice   strong   motor   and   many   settings   to   please   nearly   everyone .   i   would   recommend   it   to   a   friend ,   if   men   talked   about   such   things   .   lol
great   dryer ...   love   this   dryer .   low   setting   left   hair   dry   but   not   static   like   some   dryers .   higher   settings   may   be   better   suited   for   long   hair .   nice   color   combination .
what   she   wanted   my   daughter   purchased   this   and   because   she   wanted   something   cheap   and   in   expensive   but   with   good   quality .   this   was   perfect .   it   came   with   the   concentrator .   the   one   negative   thing   i   have   to   say   is   that   my   daughter   would   ve   liked   to   have   something   like   the   universal   finger   diffuser .   other   then   that   it   has   really   nice   settings   low   med   and   high   with   a   cooler   button   and   it   isn   t   very   heavy .
great   product   with   greta   price   the   product   works   great ,   i   saw   some   reviews   saying   it   is   very   noisy ,   i   don   t   have   any   concern   when   i   use   it .   the   only   thing   is   it   is   a   little   bit   heavier   than   i   thought ,   so   hold   it   for   a   long   time   will   make   my   arm   a   little   sour .   beside   that ,   it   is   a   very   good   product   with   very   good   price .   i   will   definitely   recommend   it .
great   blowdryer   i   was   recommended   this   blowdryer   by   a   good   friend ,   who   was   also   recommended   it   by   a   friend .   it   dries   my   hair   quickly   and   leaves   it   nice   and   smooth .   i   had   my   old   dryer   for   over   4   years ,   and   the   change   in   my   hair   s   texture   and   the   amount   of   time   it   took   to   dry   my   hair   was   huge .   i   would   recommend   this   to   anyone ,   and   i   really   like   the   look   and   style   of   it .
as   good   as   expected   this   hair   dryer   is   very   convenient .   small   and   it   has   a   pretty   good   power .   the   item   arrived   in   perfect   conditions .
remember   to   send   in   warranty   this   is   the   second   andis   30130   dryer   we   have   purchased .   the   first   one   only   lasted   6   months ,   amazons   guarantee   is   for   30   days   make   sure   you   send   in   the   warranty   if   you   purchase   one   of   these   dryers .   liked   the   dryer   is   the   reason   we   bought   a   second   one .
not   very   portable .   this   dryer   was   disappointing .   although   it   folds   for   travel ,   the   cord   attachment   increases   its   overall   size ,   making   it   clumsy   and   hard   to   pack .   the   power   switch   sticks ,   making   it   difficult   to   turn   on   off .
better   than   joico   s   blow   dryer   i   purchased   asin   b004q6jl04   joico   k   pak   quadraion   pro   dryer   about   8   months   ago ,   and   thought   it   would   be   the   answer   to   my   needs .   well ,   to   be   fair   it   was   for   about   7   months   then   it   started   dying .   br   br   so ,   i   purchased   this   one .   i   really   like   it !   it   is   a   little   louder   than   the   joico   one   but   that   doesn   t   bother   me ,   this   one   works   great .   the   buttons   take   a   minute   to   get   used   to   but   they   aren   t   a   deal   breaker .   it   dries   my   hair   just   as   fast   as   the   spendy   one ,   makes   it   shiny ,   and   has   multiple   heat   settings .   the   cold   shot   works   great   as   well .   br   br   really   is   a   great   deal   for   a   quality   dryer ,   i   tried   the   best   and   had   nothing   but   issues ... so   i   would   rate   this   one   the   best .   br   i   can   recommend   asin   b004q6lvaw   joico   k   pak   quadraion   blowdry   spray ,   5.1   fl .   oz .   it   works   with   any   dryer  
great   hair   dryer   it   is   well   priced .   it   does   an   amazing   job   at   drying   hair .   the   product   performs   as   advertised .   the   only   negative   is   the   plastic   base   legs   are   not   sturdy   strong ,   firm   enough   to   hold   the   weight   of   the   entire   equipment   and   they   will   tend   to   bend   a   litle .   pity   to   build   a   nice   product   and   have   it   downgraded   because   the   cheap   construction   of   the   base .

so   far   so   good   i   have   only   used   this   hair   dryer   one   time   but   it   was   enough   to   know   that   i   like   it .   it   did   in   fact   dry   my   hair   faster   than   my   old   revlon .   i   have   long   thick   wavy   hair   and   i   could   tell   within   a   minute   that   it   wasn   t   going   to   take   long   to   get   it   dry .   i   actually   bought   this   at   target   because   my   other   dryer   had   stopped   working   and   i   couldn   t   wait   a   few   days   for   a   new   one   to   be   shipped   to   me .   i   went   with   the   intention   on   getting   a   different   one   but   i   got   to   hold   them   both   in   my   hand   and   i   really   liked   the   way   this   one   felt .   the   handle   is   sort   of   slanted   back ,   which   sounds   awkward   but   it   feels   more   balanced   this   way .   it   also   doesn   t   have   that   annoying   high   pitched   whining   sound   that   accompanies   most   dryers .   i   also   like   that   there   is   a   cold   shot   switch   that   you   don   t   have   to   hold   in .   it   stays   on   cold   shot   until   you   switch   it   off .   the   sliding   power   switch   isn   t   difficult   to   slide .   the   tension   is   just   right   in   that   you   re   not   going   to   accidentally   switch   it   off   constantly   during   use ,   nor   will   you   have   a   hard   time   getting   it   to   move .   i   am   very   happy   so   far   with   my   purchase   but   if   anything   out   of   the   ordinary   happens ,   i   ll   be   sure   to   update   my   review .
works   like   a   charm   i   was   so   pleased   with   this   dryer ,   it   gave   my   hair   a   thicker   look .   the   volumizer   works   really   good ,   makes   my   hair   even   thicker ,   wish   it   came   with   a   comb   tho ,   but   its   good ,   and   i   love   it ...
hair   dryer   review   excellent   product .   it   works   as   advertised   and   the   power   is   sufficient   to   straighten   even   the   most   curly   hair .   i   recommend   the   product   highly .
amazing   blower   this   is   the   best   blow   dryer   i   have   brought   it   works   amazingly   on   my   hair   and   my   daughters   hair .   i   have   tried   other   blowers   but   they   would   always   leave   my   hair   fizzy   and   dull .   but   this   blower   leaves   my   hair   soft ,   manageable   and   frizz   free .
not   worth   the   money   as   others   have   written   the   night   lights   are   worthless   and   stop   working   after   about   2   days .   unfortunetly   i   bought   them   because   of   the   lights   and   thought   they   would   look   high   end   in   my   barbershop   but   instead   made   my   shop   look   bad   when   i   mounted   them   and   one   after   another   the   lights   started   blowing   out .   another   issue   is   that   i   have   personaly   noticed   is   that   the   breaker   triggers   quite   often   if   i   use   another   item   off   the   other   socket .   definetly ,   definetly   not   worth   the   price   tag   at   all .   you   can   buy   other   blowers   without   the   light   for   way   way   cheaper   so   your   really   paying   for   the   extra   light   feature   which   doesnt   work   anyway .
one   star   is   a   generous   rating   the   first   time   my   husband   used   this   dryer ,   it   seemed   great .   it   had   lots   of   power   on   high .   a   little   while   after   he   had   finished   using   it ,   he   noted   that   the   barrel   stayed   hot   for   a   long   time   after   it   was   off .   a   few   days   later   when   i   was   drying   my   daughter   s   hair   on   high   power ,   the   dryer   suddenly   lost   power .   the   high   power   had   suddenly   become   almost   low   power   but   not   quite .   i   also   noticed   a   smell   coming   from   the   dryer .   reading   through   past   reviews ,   i   m   just   glad   my   hair   dryer   didn   t   throw   off   sparks   or   catch   on   fire .   when   i   read   through   the   instruction   manual ,   there   was   a   section   that   stated   that   the   hair   dryer   had   an   internal   thermometer   that   would   cause   the   hair   dryer   to   cut   power   if   it   became   too   hot .   my   dryer   managed   to   reach   that   too   hot   temperature   in   less   than   a   minute   of   use .   don   t   waste   your   money   on   this   hair   dryer !
exactly   what   i   was   looking   for   i   have   thick   hair   that   is   cut   into   a   bob .   this   is   exactly   what   i   was   looking   for   in   a   dryer .   it   has   high   and   low   settings   and   it   also   has   1400   and   1600   adjustable   settings .   i   chose   to   keep   mine   on   1400   and   it   dries   my   hair   in   minutes .   it   is   also   perfect   for   styling   my   hair   as   i   do   the   final   drying .   i   love   the   convenience   of   having   it   mounted   on   the   wall   out   of   the   way .   it   does   have   a   nice   night   light   that   is   bright ,   but   i   count   that   as   a   plus   for   early   morning   trips   to   the   bathroom   when   you   aren   t   ready   for   a   regular   light .
do   not   buy   i   can   t   believe   this .   i   bought   this   dryer   in   a   local   store   less   than   a   year   ago   and   just   a   few   days   ago ,   it   stopped   heating .   it   just   blows   cold   air .   i   thought   mine   was   defective   so   i   was   actually   perusing   amazon   looking   for   a   replacement   for   this   dryer   when   i   saw   it   on   here   and   all   the   bad   reviews .   i   decided   to   stop   and   put   in   my   2   cents   worth .   the   switches   are   terribly   difficult   to   operate .   i   have   to   use   my   fingernails   not   my   fingers   alone .   the   retractable   cord   doesn   t   operate   very   well .   but   as   another   reviewer   said ,   the   folding   handle   is   great .   it   s   the   only   part   that   works   the   way   it   should .   also   the   attachments   are   impossible   to   stay   on .   you   just   tap   them   as   you   normally   do   while   drying   your   hair   and   they   come   off   and   go   bouncing   all   over   the   floor .   hey   revlon !   i   think   this   model   needs   more   work !
nice   dryer   this   hair   dryer   is   the   one   i   m   keeping   after   returning   two   others   to   walmart .   it   has   three   heat   settings ,   and   the   hot   is   actually   hot .   it   s   lighter   than   other   dryers   too .   it   s   my   favorite   because   it   s   significantly   quieter   than   the   others   i   tried .
grewat   dryer   i   really   like   this   dryer .   the   fact   that   it   has   a   retractable   cord   is   a   real   plus .   the   heat   and   speed   settings   are   also   great .
this   is   unbelievable   infuriating   ! ! !   my   t3   just   stopped   working   after   3   months ,   3   months   ! ! !   i   am   a   professional   and   can   not   afford   for   this   to   happen   while   blowdrying   a   clients   hair .   this   has   never ,   ever ,   happen   to   me   with   any   other   professional   blowdryer   !   i   am   taking   one   more   chance   on   this   product   since ,   i   have   a   bad   shoulder   it   really   is   light   weight   leaves   the   hair   very   smooth   shinny ...   last   chance   t3   !   side   note   there   are   plenty   of   other   blowdryers   that   also   can   do   a   great   job   !
retrater   hassle   i   was   surprised   that   it   was   smaller   than   i   expected   and   by   it   s   relatively   light   weight . but   i   had   trouble   pulling   the   plug   out ,   as   it   was   very   stiff .   when   i   finally   got   it   out   all   the   way ,   the   cord   wouldn   t   retract   when   i   pushed   the   button .   also   there   is   a   scratch   in   the   paint   about   1   4   of   an   inch   wide .   other   than   that   it   seems   to   work   just   fine . i   like   the   cool   setting .
exploded !   i   was   just   using   what   i   thought   was   my   trusty   dryer   when   it   literally   blew   up   in   my   hand .   sparks   went   flying   and   there   were   pieces   as   far   as   10   ft   away .   the   entire   back   of   the   dryer   exploded .   i   have   never   been   so   scared   of   an   appliance .   i   have   contacted   the   company   and   have   not   heard   back   from   them .   please   do   not   buy   this   it   s   very   dangerous !
andis   75370   ionic   ceramic   dryer ,   it   s   ok ,   not   great   i   have   thick   and   wavy   hair   type   which   frizz   easily   and   takes   a   long   time   to   blow   dry   using   conventional   non   ionic   hair   dryers .   when   i   first   started   using   t3   s   pro   ionic   ceramic   hair   dryer   last   year , i   noticed   and   felt   an   immediate   difference   on   my   hair .   after   using   it   for   about   two   months ,   i   m   very   happy   with   the   results .   my   hair   became   more   manageable   and   is   less   frizzy .   it   is   soft   and   smooth .   i   thought   all   the   touramaline   ionic   ceramic   hair   dryers   would   produce   similar   results .   so   i   was   searching   for   a   less   expensive   alternative   one   so   that   i   can   have   two   ionic   dryers   on   hand .   i   read   the   positive   reviews   on   this   andis   hair   dryer ,   then   i   decided   to   purchase   it .   i   m   thankful   the   delivery   was   super   fast !   after   using   it   a   few   times ,   i   have   to   say   the   result   is   just   mediocre .   compare   to   t3 ,   this   andis   model   loses   its   shine !   my   hair   feels   dry   after   using   it .   it   doesn   t   seem   to   be   able   to   smooth   out   my   hair   or   create   shine   and   eliminate   frizz   as   well   as   the   t3   does .   it   works   just   like   a   regular   hair   dryer   for   me ,   except   because   of   the   ionic   in   it ,   it   does   dry   hair   faster   than   non   ionic   hair   dryers .   overall ,   here   are   the   pros   cons   in   my   opinion   on   this   andis   75370   tourmaline   ionic   ceramic   hair   dryer .   br   br   pros   it   has   a   beautiful   black   and   gold   finish   on   the   exterior   a   good   size   for   home   use   powerful   air   flow   dries   hair   fast   3   heat   settings   2   air   speeds   has   the   cool   shot   button   br   br   cons   feels   heavy   on   hand   noisy   heat   settings   air   speeds   settings   are   in   odd   position ,   the   switches   seem   to   get   in   the   way   while   holding   and   using   the   dryer   the   blue   ion   indicator   light   is   extremely   bright ,   it   s   very   annoying   the   overall   result   in   terms   of   adding   silkiness   and   shine   isn   t   impressive   not   sure   if   the   heating   material   is   made   with   solid   ceramic   br   br   the   bottom   line   this   hair   dryer   is   not   bad ,   it   does   the   drying   job   alright .   i   just   don   t   think   it   s   great   for   those   with   thick   wavy   coarse   hair   type   hoping   to   get   smoother   and   luster   result   after   blow   dry .   if   your   hair   type   is   normal   fine ,   frizz   is   not   the   major   concern   for   you ,   you   may   be   okay   and   satisfied   with   this   one . w   dry .   if   your   hair   type   is   normal   fine ,   frizz   is   not   the   major   concern   for   you ,   you   may   be   okay   and   satisfied   with   this   one .
good   product   but   slide   buttons   need   to   be   raised   for   better   on   off   actions   this   is   the   first   thing   i   bought   on   line   before .   after   my   hairdryer   broke   and   visiting   a   couple   of   stores   with   no   success   to   replace   it ,   i   decided   to   put   my   amazon   prime   account   to   use .   the   hairdryer   arrived   on   time .   the   pink   was   a   little   different   from   what   i   thought   it   would   be ,   but   still   nice .   the   retracting   cord   is   great .   no   more   wrapping   the   hairdryer   cord   around   the   unit .   this   is   what   sold   me   on   this   unit   to   begin   with .   my   only   problem   with   the   unit   is   the   slide   buttons .   they   are   not   raised ,   so   it   is   harder   to   control   the   heat   settings   and   also   shut   on   and   off .   overall   i   am   very   happy   with   the   unit .   the   price   was   great   and   the   retractable   cord   overrides   any   button   issues .   if   you   order   this ,   you   will   be   very   pleased ! !   another   plus ,   it   is   not   as   large   as   you   would   think   it   would   be ,   so   it   will   be   great   for   traveling .   you   go   amazon !
nice   1600   watt   hair   dryer   having   fine   hair   i   find   the   1875   watt   hair   dryers   a   little   too   forceful   to   be   able   to   style   my   hair   while   drying   it   so   i   was   looking   for   a   1600   watt   hoping   that   it   would   make   a   difference   and   it   did .   they   are   hard   to   find   so   i   was   really   happy   to   find   this   one .   it   s   nice   lightweight   and   even   comes   with   some   styling   tools . i   personally   couldn   t   be   happier !
nice   product   this   is   the   second   one   we   have   ordered ,   product   works   great ,   easy   install   and   very   powerful ,   last   one   was   left   on   and   clipped   into   the   holder ,   it   melted   the   holder   enought   so   it   would   not   stay   in .   have   had   the   first   one   about   4   years   with   no   problems ,   use   almost   every   day   and   still   works   well .   keeps   the   bathroom   counter   and   cabinet   free .
another   mistake   there   is   no   way   to   adjust   the   height   of   the   bonnet .   the   high   setting   will   burn   your   scalp   and   the   low   setting   takes   too   long .   and   this   is   the   top   of   the   line  
bad   choice   i   have   used   this   new   dryer   not   more   than   5   times   in   the   past   3   months   since   i   purchased   and   the   retractable   chord   is   already   broken .   it   keeps   retracting   even   when   i   want   to   use   the   dryer .   i   have   to   stand   very   close   to   the   plug   point   and   i   cannot   dry   or   style   my   hair   comfortably .   although   the   dryer   is   in   working   condition   as   of   now   ,   the   chord   makes   it   impossible   to   work   with .   so   please   do   not   get   carried   away   with   this   fancy   pink   color   and   retractable   chord   facility .   i   too   read   the   reviews   and   was   very   excited   to   use   this   product   but   it   was   a   bad   experience   for   me .   i   would   suggest   a   regular   simple   long   and   dangling   chord   dryer   rather   than   a   complex   retractable .   also ,   i   find   this   dryer   a   little   bit   more   heavier   than   other   dryers ,   making   my   hairstyling   time   very   painful   and   also   long .
no   cool   shot   in   your   description   it   said   it   has   a   cool   shot .   this   was   the   one   thing   that   i   was   looking   for ,   and   it   does   not   have   it .   disapointing .
quiet   and   convenient   to   use ..   unlike   some   hairdryer   s   that   claim   to   be   quiet   and   not   blast   your   eardrums ... this   one   is   really   quiet   and   has   no   loud   pitch   or   squeal .   lightweight   and   folds   up   when   you   need   to   travel .   great   design   on   the   retractable   cord .. which   once   you   have   this   you   won   t   be   able   to   ever   buy   one   without   this   feature .
review   from   a   veteran   professional   hair   stylist   i   purchased   this   item   for   home   use   three   years   ago .   yesterday   morning   after   towel   drying   my   hair ,   i   started   the   dryer   and   a   blade   broke   off   in   the   turbo   fan   not   unlike   a   jet   engine   blowing   up .   there   were   no   fragments   flying   around   the   room ,   it   simply   locked   up   with   unmistakable   fumes   of   wire   insulation   roasting .   the   power   surge   button   did   it   s   job   well   by   instantly   shutting   off .   br   this   little   hair   dryer   was   used   daily   by   several   people , guests   and   visiting   relatives   for   three   years .   br   visitors   constantly   remark   where   did   you   get   this   wonderful   little   hair   dryer   br   i   ordered   two   more   for   my   home   this   morning .   br   it   s   not   quiet .   the   thing   does   scream .   it   is   however ,   remarkably   fast   drying   hair   and   the   night   light   works   well .
andis   dryer   product   dries   hair   quickly .   although   larger   and   heavier   than   most   folding   dryer   s , the   price   was   good   and   so   far   the   quality   has   been   good   also .
andis   elevate   professional   lightweight   tourmaline   ceramic   ionic   hair   dryer   review   this   is   a   great   dryer   for   me   because   i   would   have   to   consciously   try   to   overdry   my   hair .   i   have   a   cheap   conair   that   i   keep   on   hand   for   when   my   good   dryers   break   so   i   can   get   by   until   a   good   one   arrives .   this   is   a   good   one ,   and   what   a   difference !   i   m   so   glad   it   arrived   quickly   or   my   hair   would   ve   been   toast !   i   have   thick ,   fine ,   fuzzy   flyaway   hair   and   with   the   pik   attachment   i   have   had   no   problems .   the   only   problem   was   on   my   end .   when   the   unit   arrived ,   i   thought   the   spongy   tape   material   within   the   concentrators   were   for   packing   purposes   so   removed   it .   i   had   to   get   some   more   from   a   local   craft   store   so   do   not   remove   that   tape ! !   my   bad .   br   br   again ,   i   m   not   a   professional   but   i   don   t   want   charbroiled   hair   either .   i   m   pretty   confident   that   won   t   happen   with   either   of   these   products   and   the   other   haircare   products   i   use .   i   m   fond   of   haircare   products   with   argan   oil   in   them   for   its   thermal   protection   since   my   stylist   tells   me   my   ends   aren   t   bad   at   all   that   s   after   she   reprimands   me   for   not   coming   in   but   every   6   to   9   months .   br   br   i   ordered   the   asin   b002rc8imq   andis   elevate   nano   diamond   ceramic   digital   flat   iron   to   go   with   it   and   was   not   so   happy ,   so   see   that   review   to   understand   why .   br   br   i   even   used   the   elevate   on   my   dog   today   without   issue .   of   course   it   helps   that   i   used   to   groom   dogs   so   know   better   than   to   leave   it   in   one   spot   for   too   long   which   can   endanger   a   pet   by   burning   him   her .   br   br   addendum   03   15   2012   br   i   ve   noticed   a   few   people   complain   about   the   design   of   the   dryer   with   regard   to   the   on   off   switch   and   utilizing   the   pik   attachment .   it   takes   some   getting   used   to   in   order   to   hold   the   dryer   and   feed   your   hair   through   the   pik .   i   had   a   difficult   time   at   first   as   well .   i   can   t   describe   the   way   i   do   it   i   m   not   even   sure   i   m   doing   it   correctly   .   i   can   only   say   that   once   i   got   used   to   it ,   it   was   easy   to   use   the   pik   and   not   shut   the   dryer   off .
really   good   this   is   the   first   electric   equipment   i   bought   from   amazon ,   and   it   is   all   beyond   my   expectation .   i   highly   recommend   it .   if   you   want   to   buy   a   non   professional   hair   blower   with   professional   effect ,   you   should   try   this .   the   only   thing   not   perfect   is   that   the   plug   is   a   little   hard   to   fit ,   but   it   s   okay .
cool   shot   feature   is   nice   this   is   a   good   hair   dryer   in   a   fun   color .   the   best   feature   of   this   hair   dryer   is   the   cool   shot   feature ,   which   blows   cool   air   for   just   a   moment .   this   is   nice   if   you   are   starting   to   overheat   from   all   of   the   hot   air .   and   the   best   part   is   that   it   actually   gets   more   powerful   rather   than   less   powerful   when   using   the   cool   shot   feature .   the   only   negative   is   that   this   hair   dryer   is   a   bit   big   and   bulky ,   but   this   is   not   a   major   problem .   overall ,   i   like   and   recommend   this   hair   dryer .
low   noise   dryer   this   hair   dryer   has   a   lower   noise   level   when   in   use .   many   dryers   have   a   very   high   pitch   whine   from   the   fan   motor .   fan   was   found   as   the   dryer   provided   in   a   hampton   inn .
rhode   island   customer   two   other   hair   dryers   died   in   one   week .   this   came   quickly ,   and   in   good   condition .   i   seems   to   do   a   good   job ,   and   to   offer   options   for   heat   and   power .   i   d   purchase   from   the   vendor   again .

great   buy   pros   lots   of   nice   features   fold   up   handle   and   retracting   cord .   really   does   make   my   hair   feel   soft   and   seem   healthier .   br   br   cons   it   s   not   as   lightweight   as   i   would   have   hoped   or   some   other   reviews   have   said .   it   s   also   not   as   quiet   as   other   reviews   have   stated ,   the   noise   is   average ,   not   any   quieter   or   louder   than   others   that   i   have   owned .   br   br   overall ,   i   am   happy   with   it ,   especially   for   the   25.00   price .   br   br   update   04   16   13   owned   for   over   a   year   and   still   going   strong .
decent   dryer   this   dries   quickly   and   the   heat   is   gentle   producing   hair   with   less   frizz   that   is   sleeker   and   shinier   than   the   hair   that   older   dryers   produce .   the   downsides   are   the   bulk   and   the   size .   i   find   the   size   of   the   dryer   sometimes   is   offputting   to   move   around   the   head   not   impossible   but   alot   better   with   a   smaller   dryer .   i   also   don   t   care   for   how   poorly   the   labels   for   the   heat   and   air   settings   wears   its   only   a   few   months   old   and   already   there   s   alot   of   wear   due   to   how   my   hand   usually   grips   the   handle .   i   notice   this   issue   alot   in   chinese   made   goods   especially   keyboards   ,   but   its   annoying   nonetheless .
a   good   dryer   got   this   for   a   relative   for   xmas .   she   is   very   pleased   with   it .   it   has   3   fan   speeds ,   which   is   not   that   easy   to   find   any   more .   it   comes   with   a   couple   of   drying   accessories ,   too .   it   is   not   lightweight   though ,   which ,   in   my   view   is   the   only   shortcoming .
dryer   scam   hi ,   i   commented   that   i   get   the   dryer   is   in   the   photo   with   carecteristicas   they   offer ,   i   feel   cheated   and   very   angry ,   because   i   rely   on   information   that   you   published   the   photo   in   addition   to   the   product   but   it   is   not ,   the   dryer   sent   me   has   nothing   to   do   with   what   they   are   offering ,   i   feel   cheated ,   robbed .   are   a   very   bad   sellers ,   they   offer   a   product   that   ultimately   can   not   sell .
great   dryer   for   fine   hair   despite   trying   many   hair   conditioners   and   smoothers ,   my   hair   remained   dry   and   frizzy .   finally ,   someone   advised   me   it   might   be   my   hairdryer .   i   needed   the   concentrator   attachment .   i   checked   amazon   s   reviews ,   and   noted   that   this   dryer   did   not   work   well   on   thick   or   long   hair .   so ,   it   seemed   perfect   for   my   short ,   thin   hair .   and   i   am   satisfied .   even   at   the   same   1875   watts   as   my   old   conair   dryer ,   this   one   does   not   seem   to   get   very   hot   and   it   does   take   longer   to   dry   my   hair ,   about   10   15   minutes   longer .   i   ve   had   two   ion   dryers   that   claim   to   dry   hair   faster ,   and   i   don   t   believe   it .   but ,   i   am   better   able   to   style   my   hair   while   i   dry   it ,   and   am   pleased   with   the   results .   my   hair   looks   shiny   and   has   almost   no   frizz ,   even   in   the   dry   air   of   a   heated   house .
love   this   dryer !   i   have   long   hair   that   takes   forever   to   dry .   my   boyfriend   bought   this   for   me   for   my   birthday   and   it   has   taken   time   off   of   my   morning   routine   and   it   also   matches   my   curling   wands !   i   love   the   pink   and   black   design   and   it   s   much   quieter   than   my   old   hair   dryer .   i   highly   recommend   it !
great   dryer   works   fantastic   and   came   with   a   diffuser   and   another   nozzle   for   straigtening !   very   inexpensive   and   works   great !   i   bought   one   for   myself   and   one   for   my   mother .
hair   dryer   my   wife   wanted   this   to   replace   an   old   broken   one .   it   arrived   on   time   and   works   as   advertised   with   no   problems   so   far .   she   said   she   likes   it .
it   s   not   working ,   never   stay   on   the   mirror ,   fall   don ,   and   it   broke   my   large   mirror   last   time   it   s   not   working ,   never   stay   on   the   mirror .   falls   down   all   the   time   in   few   hours ,   and   it   broke   my   large   mirror   last   time .   i   hate   it ,   and   i   am   not   going   to   use   it .
nice   for   the   price   this   hair   dryer   is   pretty   good   for   the   price .   it   has   alot   of   options   as   far   as   speed   and   heat ,   plus   has   the   turbo   option   and   a   cool   shot .   it   doesn   t   dry   my   hair   faster   unless   i   use   the   turbo   option ,   even   then   it   s   not   a   big   difference .   i   still   like   the   hair   dryer   though ,   it   s   easy   to   handle   and   does   it   s   job .
great   hairdryer   i   m   just   a   guy   and   my   needs   for   a   good   hairdryer   are   the   following   br   good   airflow   br   quiet   br   drys   the   hair   quickly   br   this   hair   dryer   meets   all   three ,   plus   the   price   is   right .
best   hair   dryer   yet   i   have   very   long   hair   so   it   use   to   take   me   about   20   min   to   dry   .   i   read   the   reviews   so   i   thought   i   would   take   a   chance   what   a   differece   with   this   hair   dryer   it   only   took   5   min   i   could   not   believe   it   def   not   sending   this   one   back
great   little   hair   dryer   it   s   a   great   little   hair   dryer .   small   footprint   on   wall   dries   hair   efficiently .   what   more   could   you   ask   for .
quiet   and   dries   my   hair   quickly   this   unit   is   quieter   than   others   i   have ,   and   dries   my   hair   faster   seems   to   have   good   power .   i   also   find   it   comfortable   to   hold   and   the   switches   work   smoothly .
powerful   this   is   my   first   non   12   drugstore   hairdryer   and   i   think   i   m   satisfied .   the   difference   isn   t   as   miraculous   as   i   was   hoping   it   would   be   but   it   s   still   a   very   good   hairdryer .   when   i   used   it   with   no   attachments   it   blew   my   hair   into   oblivion   but   dried   my   very   thick   hair   in   record   time .   not   a   hairdo   i   could   leave   the   house   with   though .   but   when   i   used   the   curly   hair   attachment   the   one   with   the   prongs   it   worked   perfectly   albeit   taking   longer   to   dry   .   my   only   complaint   is   that   the   buttons   are   placed   right   where   my   hand   holds   the   dryer   which   means   that   until   i   got   used   to   adjusting   my   grip ,   i   would   constantly   be   turning   it   off   or   changing   the   settings   inadvertently .   i   don   t   really   like   the   way   that   i   have   to   gingerly   hold   the   thing   to   avoid   this .   overall ,   if   you   re   looking   to   upgrade   to   a   grown   up   hair   dryer ,   this   one   is   a   good   one .
great   hair   dryer   for   men   context   i   am   a   male ,   who   needs   a   hair   dryer   to   volumize   texturize   dry   as   quickly   as   possible   in   the   mornings .   pros   does   exactly   what   i   need   it   to .   dries   quickly   and   efficiently .   shapes   my   hair   exactly   the   way   i   want   it .   multiple   modes   that   i   switch   among   depending   on   how   wet   my   hair   is   post   shower   or   a   little   later   .   feels   nice   to   hold   i   don   t   mind   the   weight   actually   prefer   heaviness   .   cons   very   few .   size   is   a   bit   large   and   non   compact .
i   ended   up   returning   it ...   first   of   all ,   it   came   in   it   s   original   packaging ,   but   it   looked   like   it   had   been   opened   before   multiple   times .   i   was   sceptical ,   but   i   plugged   it   in   and   tried   it   out .   it   was   a   little   heavy ,   but   worked   nicely .   though   i   didn   t   like   that   you   can   t   change  
awesome   hair   dryer !   compact ,   sleek   and   the   best   part   is   the   dual   voltage   that   makes   this   the   best   travel   companion   i   could   ask   for .   did   i   mention   that   it   works   so   well ,   that   it   takes   me   half   the   time   it   used   to   with   my   old   dryer .   a   must   buy !   i   m   planning   to   buy   a   couple   more   as   gifts !

warm   is   warmer   than   hot !   i   bought   this   hairdryer   because   my   last   conair   had   finally   conked   out   after   about   15   years .   i   took   it   out   of   the   box   to   test   it ,   plugged   it   in ,   turned   it   on   and   almost   immediately   decided   to   return   it .   i   liked   to   use   the   hot   setting   on   my   old   dryer ,   so   i   kicked   the   temperature   setting   up   to   hot   on   this   one   and   was   stunned   to   find   that   the   warm   setting   is   actually   hotter   than   the   hot   setting .   the   hot   setting   was   barely   warmer   than   the   cool   setting .   something   is   seriously   wrong   with   that .   also ,   the   cord   was   very   difficult   to   retract .   i   can   understand   why   so   many   people   say   that   the   cord   keeper   function   stopped   working   after   a   very   short   time .   this   convinced   me   that   even   though   a   retracting   cord   may   be   convenient ,   it   is   more   trouble   than   it   is   worth .
good   blower   i   have   received   this   product   today   and   used   it .   this   blower   makes   my   hair   more   manageable ,   and   dried   it   faster   too .   i   have   a   thick   hair ,   and   although   my   old   blower   is   not   really   old   3   4   years   old   but   it   makes   my   hair   frizzy   after   i   use   it .   after   reading   the   reviews ,   i   said   that   i   will   give   it   a   try ,   and   i   am   happy   that   i   did .   i   like   this   product   and   i   recommended   it .   p . s .   i   also   read   in   some   of   the   reviews   that   they   died   after   several   months   so   for   now   i   am   giving   it   5   stars   and   i   will   update   my   review   if   it   breaks   since   i   just   used   it   once .
love   this   dryer !   i   purchased   this   dryer   6   months   ago .   i   have   very   long   and   thick   hair   it   takes   me   20   minutes   every   morning   to   blow   dry   my   hair .   i   have   not   had   a   problem   with   this   product   yet ,   and   i   love   the   folding   handle   and   retractable   cord .   the   retractable   cord   gets   a   little   hung   up   at   the   very   end ,   so   i   feed   it   through   manually   for   the   last   couple   of   inches .   not   a   big   deal   in   my   opinion .
alternative   to   obsolete   conair   1600   i   bought   the   andis   1600   hair   dryer   as   an   alternative   to   the   conair   1600 .   the   conair   1600   is   now   impossible   to   find   anywhere ,   but   i   don   t   like   the   more   up   to   date   1875   watt   conairs   as   they   blow   either   too   hot   or   too   cool .   the   andis   has   four   settings   instead   of   two   or   three   on   conair   dryers ,   which   provides   good   heat   control .   it   s   very   robust   and   not   too   heavy .   br   what   i   didn   t   know   when   i   originally   wrote   this   review   was   that   the   first   one   would   only   last   8   months .   however ,   a   replacement   dryer   i   received   under   warranty   is   still   going   a   year   and   a   half   later ,   so   maybe   i   was   unlucky   the   first   time   around .
i   love   this   hair   dryer !   it   dries   my   hair   quickly ,   is   small   enough   to   pack   in   my   suitcase ,   has   a   retractable   cord ,   and   makes   my   hair   incredibly   silky   and   smooth .   and   you   can   t   beat   the   price   either .   i   m   never   buying   another   dryer   brand   model   as   long   as   this   one   is   in   production .
  5   high   watts ,   nice   attachments   and   when   i   purchased   it   was   a   little   higher ,   but   still   worth   the   price .   i   still   use   it   to   this   day ,   the   cheery   brightens   the   day   too .
difficult   to   assemble   product   works   fair   on   thin   hair   but   on   denser   curly   hair   takes   an   excessive   time   would   not   reccomend   for   travel   or   heavy   thick   hair .   my   last   revlon   was   more   compact   dried   faster   easier   for   the   children   to   use   before   school .
very   happy !   i   first   used   this   blowdryer   at   a   hotel   and   liked   it   so   much   i   looked   for   it   online .   i   was   pleasantly   surprised   to   find   it   so   affordable !   this   blowdryer   is   light   and   dries   my   hair   very   fast .   it   cut   my   drying   time   by   more   than   half   compared   with   my   former   professional   grade   more   expensive   blowdryer .   i   timed   it   and   dried   my   fine ,   wavy   chin   length   hair   straight   in   4   minutes   i   also   used   the   vidal   sassoon   vs7963   ionic   thermal   all   purpose   brush   .   the   retractable   cord   prevents   cord   tangles   and   extra   cord   weight .   this   blowdryer   is   easy   to   use   and   a   great   value   for   the   price !   br   br   update   11   25   12   br   almost   a   year   later ,   the   blowdryer   still   works   very   well .   nothing   broke   and   i   enjoyed   it   all   year .   today   i   took   off   one   star ,   however ,   because   the   dryer   doesn   t   come   with   enough   options   no   styling   nozzle   or   difuser .   the   settings   are   also   very   basic .   so   i   did   buy   a   new   blowdryer   from   a   different   brand   for   not   much   more   money   than   ths   one ,   in   order   to   have   more   options   such   as   two   styling   nozzles   and   options   for   3   temperatures   at   different   blowing   speeds .   still ,   i   believe   i   got   my   money   s   worth   with   this   very   decent   andis .
good   product   love   it ,   love   it .   i   really   like   how   this   dryer   works   on   my   hair .   it   does   not   br   leave   it   dry   or   fly   away ,   but   nice ,   shiny   and   lively .
bespoke   hairdryer   i   was   very   disappointed   in   this   hairdryer .   i   tried   it   out   and   it   seemed   to   work   fine   then   when   i   went   to   use   it ,   it   wouldn   t   cut   on .   i   smelled   smoke   and   saw   sparks .   i   just   returned   it   and   hope   to   get   a   replacement   soon .   hopefully   that   one   will   work   better .
is   a   good   hair   dryer ,   but   not   the   best !   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   for   a   xmas   present   and   in   amazon   everybody   said   something   good   about   this   hair   dryer ,   that   was   enought   for   my   to   buy   it .   and   she   love   it   but   she   said   takes   time   to   dryer   the   hair ,   so   i   thought   double   fan   must   to   be   enought   but   not ! ,   is   kind   of   weird   because   is   a   remington   one   of   the   best ! ,   but   is   fine !   so   what   do   you   think  
great   quality !   i   love   this   hair   dryer ,   decided   to   get   a   replacement   hair   dryer   because   my   other   one   was   dying   and   it   took   me   forever   to   dry   my   hair .   this   hair   dryer   is   not   only   great   quality   but   it   actually   dries   my   hair   in   half   the   time .   it   looks   good   and   very   easy   to   use .   the   motor   in   the   dryer   is   not   loud   and   annoying   like   some   hair   dryers .   my   only   complaint   is   that   i   keep   pressing   the   button   while   drying   my   hair .   but   i   think   once   i   get   used   to   holding   the   dryer   from   the   bottom ,   it   will   be   fine .   if   you   want   a   good   hair   dryer   for   a   great   price ,   this   is   it .
just   what   i   wanted   except ......   it   was   powerful   as   advertised   and   according   to   reviewers .   i   realize   the   faster   the   fan ,   the   more   it   dilutes   the   heat   from   the   heating   coils ,   but   it   could   be   a   little   warmer .   i   d   still   recommend   it   though .
solid   hair   dryer   bought   this   for   my   girlfriend   over   a   year   ago   and   it   s   still   working .   br   br   the   very   nice   soft   touch   coating   has   started   to   peel   away   pretty   significantly   though ,   but   for   25   i   guess   i   can   t   complain   too   much .
happy   days   my   wife   has   been   wanting   one   of   these   after   our   first   motel   several   years .   now   we   have   one   of   the   best   hair   dryers   we   have   ever   had   works   great   arrived   earlier   than   told .
i   love   it !   i   love   my   t3   micro   featherweight   luxe   hair   dryer .   i   had   used   my   friends   sultra   hair   dryer   and   loved   it ...   so   i   started   to   research   investing   in   a   quality   hair   dryer   myself   and   decided   on   the   t3 .   i   can   t   believe   how   much   faster   my   hair   dries   with   it   and   my   hair   is   so   much   silkier   now .   truly   frizz   free !   it   is   very   light   weight   and   easy   to   use .   i   actually   took   the   time   to   plug   in   my   old   conair   hair   dryer   and   compare   to   my   new   t3 ,   and   it   felt   like   someone   was   just   blowing   on   my   head   to   dry   it , lol .   it   really   made   me   value   my   new   dryer .   my   hair   is   straighter   and   easier   to   maintain   with   out   all   the   old   ways   i   used   to   use   to   style .
drys   hair   quickly   my   daughter   recommended   that   i   buy   this   dryer .   i   have   curly   hair   that   absorbs   water   and ,   even   though   my   hair   is   short ,   it   usually   takes   a   long   time   to   dry   one   strand .   by   that   time   some   of   the   other   hair   gets   frizzy .   this   dryer   is   a   vast   improvement   over   the   many   other   dryers   i   own .   i   also   bought   it   for   my   daughter   in   law   who   has   long   hair   and   was   frustrated   with   the   drying   time .   her   hair   is   straight   and   she   loves   this   product .
heating   element   stopped   working   in   less   than   2   years   with   minimal   usage   by   just   one   person ,   this   blow   dryer   no   longer   works .   only   blow   cold   air .   what   a   rip   off ,   i   have   another   professional   dryer   that   is   15   years   old ,   still   blowing   hot   and   strong .   do   not   buy   this   one .
eh ...   the   hairdryer   is   only   okay .   i   will   say   that   the   cord   is   very   sturdy ,   which   was   a   concern   from   other   reviewers .   my   previous   hairdryer   was   the   chi   turbo   professional ,   and   it   lasted   about   5   years .   i   don   t   like   this   hairdryer   as   much   as   my   chi ,   and   i   ve   had   it   long   enough   3   months   to   get   used   to   it .   it   isn   t   super   quiet   like   some   reviews   said ,   and   it   doesn   t   dry   my   hair   any   faster   than   my   chi .   also ,   the   front   of   the   nose   before   the   black   attachment   gets   very   hot   and   you   can   t   hold   it .   i   like   to   hold   my   hairdryers   at   the   nose   when   i   am   drying   the   front   of   my   hair ,   but   now   i   can   t .   i   ll   definitely   keep   this   hairdryer   until   it   s   time   to   get   a   new   one ,   but   it   didn   t   impress   me .   it   still   gets   3   stars   because   it   isn   t   a   bad   hairdryer ,   but   also   it   s   nothing   special .
didn   t   last   this   hair   dryer   started   out   great   and   i   loved   the   added   night   light   feature .   it   did   not   last   long   at   all   so   now   i   m   shopping   for   something   to   replace   it .   my   poor   wall ,   this   will   be   the   third   dryer .   i   am   beginning   to   wonder   if   there   is   a   wallmount   dryer   that   lasts   more   than   a   year .
don   t   buy   this   dryer   i   bought   this   dryer   2   months   ago ,   and   even   with   light   use ,   it   has   now   quit   working .   don   t   buy   this   it   s   junk .
hair   dryer   i   ve   only   used   this   dryer   a   couple   of   times   but   it   is   great   so   far .   it   is   actually   much   nicer   looking   than   in   the   picture ,   it   is   quieter   than   my   last   dryer ,   it   dries   my   hair   a   bit   faster   than   my   old   dryer ,   and   as   for   the   temperature   hot   is   hot   warm   is   warm   and   the   cool   is   truly   cool !   the   only   downside   is   the   cord   is   like   2   too   short   when   i   am   trying   to   blow   dry   my   daughters   hair .   but   i   guess   that   is   more   of   a   personal   problem   ha   ha   ha !   i   would   recommend   this   dryer !
exellent   product   difficult   shipping   the   product   was   exactly   what   we   expected   excellent .   the   arrangement   for   receiving   the   product   was   much   more   difficult   as   amazon . com   would   not   ship   this   product ,   only   available   in   the   us ,   to   canada .
definitely   worth   the   money   i   have   been   using   the   much   more   expensive   tan   towels   brand   for   several   weeks ,   but   i   decided   to   give   these   ones   a   whirl .   the   tan   towels   were   just   getting   to   be   very   pricey .   i   found   that   these   ones   work   just   as   well   as   the   others !   however ,   it   seems   like   it   takes   a   few   more   applications   with   the   loreal   brand   to   get   the   same   color   as   tan   towels ,   but   for   this   price   that   hardly   matters .   some   may   even   think   this   is   a   positive ,   because   it   allows   you   more   control   over   your   tan .   i   used   these   every   night   for   3   days   and   i   have   a   wonderful   natural   looking   glow .   not   too   dark   at   all   and   not   overly   noticable .   these   are   great   for   us   fair   skinned   folks   that   only   need   a   bit   of   color .   i   m   not   sure   you   can   call   this   a   deep   dark   tan ,   but   that   wasn   t   what   i   was   looking   for   anyway .   these   take   a   bit   of   practice   to   use   since   you   can   t   see   where   it   is   going   on   ,   but   after   becoming   an   expert   with   the   tan   towels ,   these   were   easy .   always   use   a   circular   motion !   also ,   i   found   that   putting   a   little   bit   of   lotion   on   my   writs   after   application   really   helps   with   the   steaking   on   my   wrists   this   was   a   problem   area   for   me   .   and ,   i   wash   my   hands   immediately   afterward   and   use   the   much   lighter   jergens   natural   glow   lotion   on   my   hands   instead ,   this   also   helps   with   the   streaking   factor .
never   knew   a   blowdryer   could   make   such   a   difference !   i   have   long ,   mid   back   length ,   color   treated   hair .   i   take   really   good   care   of   it   and   only   use   salon   products ,   use   heat   protectant   etc .   i   get   my   hair   trimmed   regularly ,   but   my   ends   just   felt   really   dry   and   my   hair   was   so   unmanageable .   my   old   blowdryer   was   a   bedhead   one   and   it   made   my   hair   so   hot   i   couldn   t   even   touch   it .   i   decided   to   invest   in   the   chi   rocket   after   reading   the   great   reviews .   i   honestly   can   t   believe   what   a   huge   difference   it   s   made   in   my   hair .   it   s   amazingly   soft   and   smooth .   i   really   don   t   even   need   to   do   anything   else   to   it   after   blowdrying ,   but   i   use   a   big   curling   iron   and   it   looks   fantastic !   i   wish   i   would   have   bought   this   years   ago !   i   will   never   go   back   to   a   cheap   blowdryer   again !
voluminous   i   think   not .   lumpy   clumpy   crap ... threw   it   away   and   went   to   cvs   to   get   my   usual   brand .   waste   of   money .   does   not   do   what   it   says .
excellent ! ! !   this   stuff   worked   miracles   on   my   callused   feet   and   my   cuticles .   along   with   being   antimicrobial   you   can   t   miss   with   this   product .   very   little   goes   along   way   so   it   will   last   you .
medieval   i   have   to   agree   with   the   critics   on   this   one .   i   used   it   and   even   the   soft   meshy   side   was   too   rough   on   your   skin .   i   bought   a   package   of   four   i   hope   i   can   return   three   of   them .   the   verdict   is   still   out   on   the   axe   shower   gel   in   terms   of   cleanliness .
pump   is   defective   i   bought   this   product   because   i   had   a   lot   of   tattoos   and   didn   t   want   to   fade   them ,   however   once   i   got   it   in   the   mail   and   used   it   for   the   first   few   times   the   pump   did   not   work   and   it   took   forever   to   get   the   lotion   out   of   the   bottle .
love   it ,   purse   size ,   pricey   worth   it .   smells   like   fruit   loops .   i   love   tsi   la .   their   scents   are   great   and   all   natural   without   making   you   smell   like   an   incense   shop .   i   ve   tried   other   natural   scents   that   are   overpowering   or   as   my   non   crunchy   sister   would   say   it   smells   ethnic   in   here   when   i   walk   into   a   room .   moving   on ,   all   the   tsi   la   scents   i   ve   tried   are   great .   i   dont   use   perfume   every   day ,   but   i   keep   this   little   rollerball   in   my   purse   cosmetic   bag   in   case   i   go   to   an   afterwork   event   or   to   freshen   up   if   i   m   on   the   go   all   day   before   meeting   someone   out .   i   m   no   scent   expert ,   but   to   me   fiori   d   arancio   smells   like   delicate   fruit   loops   ok   that   sounds   totally   wacky   but   its   a   sweet ,   clean   fruity   smell ,   and   smells   natural   you   can   tell   there   arent   chemicals   in   the   scent   unlike   gross   body   splashes   and   stuff .   its   really   hard   to   find   a   way   to   smell   these   before   purchasing   too ,   occasionally   you   can   find   sample   vials   on   an   auction   or   deal   site   and   they   are   expensive ,   so   the   mini   is   a   great   way   to   test   it   out   in   an   affordable   way   before   upgrading   to   a   full   size .   if   the   fruit   loop   smell   is   not   for   you ,   pass   it   on   to   a   teenage   girl   you   love .   personally   i   love   it !   sometimes   i   mix   it   with   my   lavanilla   rollerball   for   a   delicious   fruity   vanilla   scent !   if   you   are   concerned   that   perfume   has   toxic ,   hormone   distrupting   stuff   in   it ,   you   owe   it   to   yourself   to   try   tsi   la !
everything   as   it   says   however ,   i   would   have   prefered   a   more   diverse   group   of   piks .   i   bought   my   husband   a   waterpik   for   christmas   which   he   loved   .   i   wanted   to   get   a   set   for   myself ,   but   this   one   only   has   3   types   none   really   as   cool   as   his   and   dups   of   all   three .   it   s   a   good   beginner   set   i   guess ...   but   i   will   be   searching   for   some   of   the   better   ones   that   came   with   his .   i   can   t   complain   about   quality   look   closely   at   the   piks   if   you   want   two   of   each   of   the   basics   this   is   pefect   for   you .
if   you   have   a   serious   hair   emergency ,   this   is   it !   first   of   all ,   i   must   say   that   i   am   a   huge   nexxus   fan .   i   am   aware   of ,   and   i   have   tried   better   products ,   but   i   owe   nexxus   for   making   my   dream   of   having   silky   long   hair   a   reality .   being   racially   mixed   have   many   advantages ,   but   sometimes   those   combinations   come   out   a   bit   wacky ... to   make   the   story   short ,   my   hair   is   silky   soft ,   but   very ,   very   curly   and   the   result   is   crazy   breakage .   it   was   very   hard   for   me   to   grow   my   hair .   until   my   beautician   started   treating   my   hair   with   therappe   shampoo ,   emergencee   and   humectress .   she   would   trim   my   ends   every   6   weeks   and   in   less   than   a   year   my   hair   had   reached   past   my   shoulders   and   a   few   months   later   it   reached   almost   the   middle   of   my   back .   this   may   not   sound   like   much ,   but   for   someone   who   could   never   grow   her   hair   longer   than   a   short   bob   right   under   the   ears   this   is   huge .   emergencee   makes   your   hair   strong   and   supple   and   resistant   to   breakage ,   if   you   use   it   correctly   and   take   care   of   your   hair .
good   product   the   product   works   as   stated   and   much   along   the   lines   of   other   positive   reviews .   i   have   been   using   the   product   for   about   3   months   now   and   this   is   the   first   shower   mirror   that   has   been   truly   fogless .   filling   the   container   with   hot   water   is   no   hassle   and   it   works   great   every   time .
love   it !   i   love   all   things   fresh ...   but   this   bath   soak   is   truly   the   best .   the   scent   is   absolutely   luxurious ,   filling   your   entire   bath   bedroom   with   soothing   aromatics .   i   don   t   get   many   uses   out   of   it   because   my   large   bathtub   requires   i   use   a   lot ,   but   it   is   an   absolute   treat   when   i   do .   i   even   save   the   bottles   as   a   keepsake .   no   need   to   visit   the   spa   as   long   as   fresh   keeps   making   sake !   love ,   love ,   love   it !
older   product .   i   know   this   product   has   been   discontinued   so   when   i   found   it   here   i   was   really   excited .   i   used   this   alot   and   really   like   the   way   it   works .   this   bottle   smelled   a   bit   differently   that   my   bottle   i   originally   used   from   the   store .   and   didn   t   work   quite   as   well .   but   i   still   use   it   and   it   is   better   than   some   of   the   alternatives   i   have   tried .
get   amazing   curls   this   is   a   great   curling   wand .   gives   great   curls   that   last   for   days   and   doesnt   frizz   out .   i   was   worried   that   i   would   burn   my   self   since   there   s   no   heat   control   but   i   got   used   to   it   pretty   quickly   without   the   need   of   the   glove ,   wish   personally   i   dont   think   would   have   helped   much   anyway   overall ,   a   great   buy ! !   love   the   color .   also ,   a   very   nice   surprise   was   the   fact   that   it   indeed   does   have   a   swivel   cord .   even   though   the   description   says   it   doesnt .
hummer   cologne   great   value   purchased   2   large   bottles   for   the   price   of   one   small   bottle .   my   husband   loves   this   cologne   and   now   my   son   does   to .
good   base   coat   i   love   the   seche   top   coat ,   but   was   disappointed   in   its   base   coat .   this   one   is   much   better .   it   definitely   strengthens   my   nails   and   prevents   chipping .
bombshell   i   ve   been   tanning   off   on   for   a   looong   time   now .   i   stopped   for   awhile   then   got   back   into   it   just   recently   over   this   past   summer .   i   started   with   australian   golds   cheeky   brown   which   was   alright   for   starters .   then   moved   on   up   to   australian   golds   wicked .   stuck   with   that   one   for   about   2   months   but   was   longing   to   get   more   out   of   my   tanning   session .   so   i   read   the   mixed   reviews   about   bombshell   here .   some   people   loved   it   some   didn   t   shrugs   .   now   me   personally ,   i   love   tingling   lotions .   and   not   only   did   this   one   have   a   kewl   name   and   100xx ,   which   was   waay   more   then   i   d   ever   used .   but   it   has   a   foxy   lil   1950s   pin   up   girl   on   the   label .   d   so   i   ordered   it ,   it   arrived   rather   quick .   it   only   tingled   like ,   3   times   when   first   using   it .   the   smell   is   awesome .   i   didn   t   feel   like   i   needed   to   run   home   and   take   a   shower   after   applying   it .   all   in   all ,   if   you   like   that   tingle   factor .   and   are   looking   to   get   a   better   more   dark   color .   i   totally   recommend   this   lotion .  
amazing !   this   improved   my   skin   tone   and   texture   so   much .   i   have   had   troubled   skin   since   i   was   a   teenager   and   this   makes   me   feel   better   about   the   appearance   of   my   skin .   i   use   it   every   morning   and   night   and   i   saw   a   difference   within   a   couple   days   of   use .   the   brush   is   really   easy   to   change   and   i   love   the   magnetic   charger .
fair   i   received   this   product   hoping   to   cut   my   drying   time ,   but   that   wasn   t   the   case .   i   m   not   sure   if   the   product   i   received   is   defective   but   i   have   thin   hair   and   it   didn   t   help   my   dry   time .   it   also   makes   my   hair   lay   really   flat   and   somewhate   oily ,   making   my   hair   look   dirty   and   thin .   i   m   not   a   fan   of   this   dryer   but   it   may   be   better   for   people   with   thick   hair .
colorful   and   easy   to   use   these   paints   are   colorful   and   really   easy   to   use .   they   come   with   the   option   to   paint   like   normal   finger   nail   polishes   or   you   can   flip   them   over   and   use   the   paint   pen .   the   pen   option   works   well   for   doing   designs   and   nail   art .   i   would   buy   some   clear   polish   to   help   protect   the   designs   though !   the   product   is   cute   and   worth   the   money .
great   product   love   it   i   work   outside   and   in   indiana   in   the   winter   time   it   gets   relly   cold .   your   hands   take   a   beating   and   dry   up .   i   use   this   to   prevent   my   hands   from   bleeding .   i   love   this   product   and   would   recommmend   to   anyone .

awesome   top   coat   sometimes .   i   love   seche   vite   top   coat   for   all   the   reasons   that   everyone   mentions ,   specifically   the   beautiful   finish   and   how   quick   it   is   to   dry .   br   what   i   don   t   like   is   that   some   combinations   of   base   coat ,   color ,   and   seche   vite   seem   to   lead   to   my   nail   polish   coming   off   in   huge   chips   very   early   in   my   manicure .   br   br   the   one   i   ve   noticed   is   sally   hansen   quick   dry   base   coat ,   opi   nail   polish ,   and   seche   vite ..   it   will   look   fantastic ,   but   then   just   chip   in   huge   flakes   from   day   two   onward .   br   br   on   the   other   hand ,   opi   natural   nail   base ,   opi   nail   polish ,   and   seche   vite   can   give   me   10   whole   days   of   natural   nail   manicure ,   and   sally   hansen   quick   dry   base   coat ,   opi   nail   polish ,   and   sally   hansen   quick   dry   top   coat   can   give   me   7   whole   days   of   natural   nail   manicure !   br   br   so ,   if   you   love   your   seche   vite   you   may   have   to   match   your   base   and   nail   polish   to   match   it .  
lasts   long   this   blush   palette   lasts   forever   because   even   the   smallest   amount   is   still   enough .   many   to   choose   from   to   go   with   different   makeup   looks .   some   of   them   are   kind   of   orangy   tho .   i   stick   with   the   bronzes   and   pinks
worth   every   cent   the   celtrixa   cream   really   does   work !   i   am   not   sure   how   severe   or   what   kind   of   results   people   are   expecting .   i   noticed   the   stretch   cream   work   very   fast   on   my   stretch   marks .   everything   takes   time   and   i   ve   tried   other   creams   and   never   seen   results   as   quick   as   i   have   seen   on   this   one .
doesn   t   cut   it   altho   they   claim   to   be   dippity   do   it   doesn   t   come   close .   it   left   my   hair   very   dried   out   and   brittle .   i   have   a   bathroom   full   of   barely   used   jars   bottles   and   tubes   looking   for   the   elusive   substitute .   hope   someone   out   there   can   find   the   formula   and   market   it   again .   hurry ,   my   hair   is   an   unruly   mess .
one   of   my   favorite   base   coats !   i   wish   this   was   in   a   quick   dry   formula ,   but   it   s   amazing   as   is .   from   no   base   coat   to   using   this ,   i   can   add   5   days   onto   my   manicure .   2   3   extra   days   from   a   sally   hansen   base   coat ,   which   i   consider   quite   good   as   well .   br   br   obviously   the   opi   pro   brush   is   awesome   for   most   of   us ,   but   not   so   awesome   for   those   of   you   who   have   smaller   nails   and   problems   with   thick   brushes .
sephora   tart   this   was   a   gift ,   the   receiver   of   the   was   most   pleased .   i   enjoyed   shopping   on   amazon ,   they   make   it   very   easy   to   purchase   as   many   items   as   you   wish .
nice   colour   i   like   the   pigment   in   this   colour .   i   like   bascially   all   of   the   nyx   colours ,   and   they   have   a   large   variety   to   choose   from .
norelco   hair   clipper   received   the   item   quickly   and   packaged   well .   i   have   not   worked   up   the   nerve   yet   to   try   cutting   my   own   hair ,   but   have   used   it   to   cut   someone   elses   hair   and   it   worked   fine .   i   am   a   little   concerned   how   well   it   will   hold   up   over   time   as   the   different   combs   are   made   of   plastic   that   seems   kind   of   light ....   not   sure   how   well   it   will   last ,   and   if   dropped   i   am   sure   it   would   be   easily   broken .   the   cutting   length   settings   work   well ,   although   i   would   have   preferred   a   longer   setting   be   available .   i   used   the   longest   settings   for   the   top   maybe   1.5   ,   shorter   settings   for   the   side ,   and   the   shortest   settings   around   the   ears   and   back   for   a   tight   taper .   it   can   cut   very   short   and   the   cutting   blades   seem   to   be   plenty   sharp ,   giving   a   good   cut .   i   do   wish   there   would   have   been   more   guidance   on   how   to   to   give   the   user   confidence   in   cutting   their   own   hair .   i   would   suggest   the   manufacturer   prepare   an   online   video   to   teach   you   how   to   use   it   to   cut   your   own   hair   yourself .   so   far   i   have   not   used   it   on   myself   and   need   to   use   it   a   few   times   on   others   to   develop   confidence   in   doing   so .
love ,   love ,   love   this   dryer !   i   searched   and   researched   for   a   new   hairdryer   to   replace   my   sad ,   old ,   held   together   with   tape   dryer ,   and   based   on   reviews ,   put   this   one   on   my   wish   list .   finally ,   on   christmas ,   it   was   mine !   i   love   this   dryer   so   much .   it   dries   my   hair   so   much   faster   than   any   other   dryer   even   some   pricier   ones   i   ve   used   in   the   past .   the   best   part   is   that   it   doesn   t   leave   me   a   sweaty   mess   when   i   m   done .   i   don   t   know   if   it   s   just   the   air   speed ,   or   the   well   designed   air   flow   and   concentrator ,   but   even   though   it   can   blast   some   hot   air   i   actually   have   to   back   it   down   to   medium   heat   when   i   have   the   concentrator   on   ,   i   am   not   dripping   in   sweat   when   i   m   done   blowing   it   straight   section   by   section   with   my   round   brush .   this   makes   me   so   happy !   i   can   wash   and   dry   my   hair   and   be   ready   for   makeup   in   so   much   less   time   than   i   ve   ever   been   able .   it   s   no   louder   than   average .   it   s   no   heavier   than   average .   but   it   works   so   much   better   than   average .   i   love   how   you   press   the   cool   shot   button   and   it   stays   cool ,   then   push   it   again   and   it   goes   back   to   hot .   no   more   holding   it   down   awkwardly .   i   have   accidentally   pressed   it   a   time   or   two ,   but   so   easy   to   press   it   back   and   move   my   hand   down   a   smidge .   my   hair   is   very   fine   and   a   bit   wavy ,   and   i   have   a   lot   of   it ,   so   i   really   need   a   dryer   that   can   get   in   there   and   start   drying   out   the   hair ,   especially   in   the   back   and   at   the   crown ,   before   i   start   sleeking   it   down   with   the   concentrator ,   and   this   dryer   can   do   it   in   minutes   without   me   sitting   around   air   drying   it   for   20   30   minutes   first .   happy   customer   here !   highly   recommend   this   product !
love   it !   i   got   this   dryer   to   replace   my   old   one   and   wow   does   it   make   a   difference .   my   hair   is   so   soft   and   shiny .   i   can   even   use   this   to   dry   my   1   year   old   daughter   s   hair   and   i   couldn   t   to   that   with   my   old   one   because   it   would   get   too   hot   even   on   the   lower   setting .   it   dries   fast   without   burning .   definitely   worth   every   cent !

actually   makes   my   hair   look   good   i   finally   replaced   my   old   hand   me   down   conair   dryer   with   this   john   frieda   dryer ,   and   it   has   been   like   night   and   day !   br   br   the   significant   differences   are   br   br   faster   drying   i   am   pretty   busy   so   i   often   find   myself   needing   dry   hair   asap   to   pick   my   kid   up ,   to   head   outside ,   etc .   .   i   haven   t   timed   how   long   it   takes   to   dry   my   past   shoulder   length   hair ,   but   it   is   definitely   under   5   minutes ,   and   fast   enough   for   me   to   do   what   i   need   to   do .   br   br   leaves   my   hair   in   better   condition   i   always   winced   at   using   my   old   hairdryer   because   i   knew   i   was   damaging   my   hair   in   the   process .   i   ve   had   chronic   dry   hair   issues   and   my   old   dryer   left   my   hair   flying   every   which   way .   i   used   to   dry   my   hair   only   partially   to   lessen   the   damage .   this   dryer   hasn   t   erased   my   dry   hair   issues   completely   but   my   hair   is   noticeably   softer   and   i   don   t   worry   the   way   i   used   to   about   using   it   on   my   hair .   br   br   leaves   my   hair   better   looking   this   was   the   biggest   surprise   of   all .   i   have   had   such   problems   with   my   hair   that   i   had   simply   resigned   myself   to   the   fact   that   my   hair   is   hard   to   control .   my   hair   is   past   shoulder   length   as   mentioned ,   and   layered .   with   my   old   dryer   i   absolutely   needed   to   style   my   hair   if   i   wanted   to   look   presentable .   i   ve   spent   so   much   money   over   the   years   trying   out   different   brushes ,   rollers ,   etc .   i   could   never   simply   wash ,   dry   and   go   because   with   my   old   dryer   my   layers   always   ended   up   sticking   out   rather   than   curving   in ,   and   my   hair   would   not   hold   any   style   without   significant   work .   i   was   honestly   shocked   the   first   time   i   used   the   john   frieda   dryer   my   hair   fell   into   a   very   flattering   shape   after   2   3   minutes   of   drying .   i   don   t   use   a   brush ,   don   t   use   any   of   the   attachments ,   nothing .   i   just   dry   about   90   of   the   way   and   my   hair   looks   great .   it   s   too   bad   that   a   month   before   i   found   this   i   d   already   invested   in   a   set   of   steam   rollers .   now   i   won   t   be   needing   any   of   those   tools .   br   br   the   noise   level   is   normal   for   a   hairdryer .   i   would   not   say   it   is   quiet   but   it   is   not   annoyingly   loud .   it   is   also   quite   manageable   and   easy   to   hold .   i   m   petite   small   wrist   and   i   was   afraid   this   would   be   a   bit   unwieldy ,   but   it   is   lightweight   enough   to   use   without   feeling   at   all   flimpsy   or   cheap .   br   br   the   only   fault   i   have   found   so   far   is   the   positioning   of   the   buttons ,   right   where   my   hand   holds   the   dryer .   for   this   reason   i   keep   accidentally   switching   the   air   from   hot   to   cold   without   wanting   to .   but   it   s   a   minor   point   given   all   the   other   advantages . eable   and   easy   to   hold .   i   m   petite   small   wrist   and   i   was   afraid   this   would   be   a   bit   unwieldy ,   but   it   is   lightweight   enough   to   use   without   feeling   at   all   flimpsy   or   cheap .   the   only   fault   i   have   found   so   far   is   the   positioning   of   the   buttons ,   right   where   my   hand   holds   the   dryer .   for   this   reason   i   keep   accidentally   switching   the   air   from   hot   to   cold   without   wanting   to .   but   it   s   a   minor   point   given   all   the   other   advantages .
girlfriend   loves   it   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   as   a   gift   for   my   girlfriend .   she   really   seems   to   like   it .   i   can   attest   that   it   blows   hard   and   hot   is   there   anything   else   you   need   from   a   hairdryer   oh   yeah ,   it   has   widely   adjustable   temperature   and   speed ...
awesome !   i   have   never   really   bought   anything   online   and   this   is   the   first   review   i   ve   ever   written .   that   said ,   i   m   extremely   happy   with   this   purchase .   i   didn   t   know   a   hair   dryer   could   style   my   hair .   this   product   is   much   more   powerful   than   my   previous   15   drugstore   purchase .   that   feature   helps   tame   cowlicks !   overall ,   i   have   no   complaints .   i   am   very   happy ! !
for   a   quiet   dryer ,   it   s   just   okay   there   are   plenty   of   reviews   here   on   the   performance   of   this   dryer ,   which   i   think   is   fine ,   but   i   wanted   to   comment   on   it   being   a   quiet   dryer .   it   is   quieter   than   most ,   but   my   previous   conair   ionic   hair   dryer   was   80   decibels   on   high ,   and   this   one   is   90   decibels   on   high .   anything   over   80   decibels   can   damage   your   hearing ,   so   i   m   a   bit   disappointed   in   this ,   but   again ,   it   s   still   quieter   than   most   hair   dryers ...   but   i   would   have   thought   the   newer   dryer   would   have   been   even   more   quiet .
will   never   use   another   hair   dryer   again   if   you   have   thick ,   coarse ,   or   frizzy   hair ,   this   hair   dryer   compares   to   no   other .   i   bought   a   different   professional   hair   dryer   a   year   ago   for   half   the   cost ,   but   was   never   really   satisfied .   this   one   literally   cut   my   drying   time   in   half ,   30   minutes   to   15   minutes   while   leaving   my   hair   shiny   and   smooth .   i   don   t   find   it   to   be   any   heavier   or   noisier   than   any   other   hair   dryer   i   ve   used .
stopped   working   suddenly   after   6   months   had   a   previous   remington   hair   dryer   for   almost   4   years   that   worked   fine ,   but   my   hair   dresser   told   me   i   should   buy   a   new   one .   replaced   it   with   this   same   model ,   and   the   new   one   stopped   blowing   out   hot   air   after   only   6   months .   i   dry   my   hair   in   halves   with   a   break   in   between   can   t   stand   to   do   it   all   at   once   ,   and   the   dryer   randomly   stopped   working   between   halves   for   no   discernible   reason .   very   disappointed   because   i   misplaced   the   receipt ,   but   i   will   not   buy   this   brand   again .
it   s   hot !   i   love   this   hair   dryer .   i   like   the   settings   so   i   have   options   for   how   much   heat   i   put   on   my   hair .   i   also   like   the   cold   shot   button   so   i   can   dry   my   hair   without   heat .   i   like   the   attachments   with   give   me   styling   options   and   the   metallic   design   is   really   sleek .
not   good   i   was   really   suprised   with   the   poor   quality   of   this   hair   dryer .   over   the   past   many   years ,   i   have   used   the   conair   brand .   after   just   a   few   uses ,   the   retractable   cord   stopped   retracting   and   the   cool   air   button   no   longer   popped   back   up ,   so   i   all   i   was   able   to   do   was   dry   my   hair   with   cool   air .   once   i   folded   it   up ,   a   plastic   part   in   the   dryer   broke   and   a   spring   fell   out   as   well .   i   purchased   a   cheaper   non   folding ,   non   retractable   cord   dryer   and   it   works   better   than   this   more   expensive   model .   save   your   cash   and   do   not   buy   this .
nice   and   basic   this   is   a   nice   basic   hair   dryer   and   very   affordable .   no   frills ,   no   thrills ,   doesn   t   fold ,   no   retractable   cord ,   etc .   works   very   well   and   nothing   has   broken   so   far .   far   better   than   the   more   expensive   model .   so   far ,   i   m   very   pleased   with   my   purchase .
good   value   item   arrived   promptly   and   so   far   it   works   as   promised .   dries   as   quickly   as   can   be   expected   for   the   price   we   paid .
sure   beats   my   old   dryer   thanks   remington !   a   review   from   my   mother   in   law   br   br   my   hair   is   thinning   and   this   dryer   gives   me   volume !   with   my   head   upside   down   while   blow   drying ,   in   just   a   couple   of   minutes ,   i   have   full ,   shiny   and   manageable   hair !   the   user   friendly   design   is   great   too .   the   heat   and   speed   settings   are   at   a   comfortable   spot   on   the   handle   and   unlike   my   last   dryer ,   they   stay   where   i   set   them !   br   definitely   a   good   purchase
disappointed   i   just   bought   this   blower   twice   the   second   time   that   i   used   the   head   of   the   cord   melted .   this   is   something   very   dangerous   i   could   be   electrocuted .   i   don   t   recommended   this   blower   and   also   it   is   very   difficult   to   communitcate   with   remington   products .
great   hair   dryer   this   is   a   great   hair   dryer .   drys   my   hair   quickly   without   getting   overly   hot .   i   like   the   placement   of   the   switches   so   you   can   just   use   your   thumb   to   adjust   the   heat   and   flow   while   you   are   drying   and   styling .
i   hate   using   any   other   dryer !   i   ve   had   an   older   version   of   this   hair   dryer   for   several   years   now ,   mine   is   a   d   2009   so   i   m   thinking   that   s   when   i   got   it .   i   bought   mine   at   bed   bath   and   beyond .   i   fell   in   love   with   this   hair   dryer   at   once ,   and   since   then   i   get   incredibly   frustrated   whenever   i   m   at   someone   else   s   house   and   don   t   have   my   own   dryer !   it   s   so   bad   that   i   often   tote   mine   with   me ,   and   refuse   to   travel   for   a   long   time   without   it .   i   have   long   hair   of   medium   thickness   and   people   always   think   it   must   take   me   forever   to   blow   dry   my   hair ,   but   it   only   takes   about   5   10   minutes   with   this   dryer .   it   still   works   perfect ,   but   after   years   of   hanging   it   by   the   loop   on   the   cord   i   hung   a   hook   on   my   bathroom   wall   specifically   for   this   purpose   the   loop   broke ,   so   i   m   debating   if   i   want   to   buy   a   new   one   even   though   this   one   still   works   great   if   so   it   will   just   mean   that   now   i   will   have   a   spare   and   won   t   have   to   carry   mine   to   my   parent   s   house .
andis   82005   1875   watts   i   am   quite   dissapointed   in   this   hair   dryer   its   making   a   loud   noise ,   i   have   only   used   it   3   times .   its   also   cumbersome   heavy   too   large   the   warm   setting   is   far   too   hot ...   its   like   hot .   i   am   not   a   happy   customer ...
great   dryer   with   all   the   features   i   wanted   for   fine   hair   i   ve   had   this   dryer   for   over   1   1   2   years   now   and   i   love   it .   my   hairdresser   convinced   me   to   get   a   new   dryer   so   i   picked   her   brain   for   what   features   to   look   for .   when   my   daughter   said   she   wanted   a   new   dryer   i   pulled   out   the   list   of   features   my   hairdresser   gave   me   and   that   made   me   think   to   share   it   here .   1   concentrator   that   s   the   main   thing   my   old   one   lacked   and   why   it   was   worth   buying   a   new   one   just   for   that .   i   have   shorter   hair   and   use   a   curved   brush   to   style   in   shape   the   concentrator   focuses   the   heat   on   the   curve   i   m   styling   and   it   does   make   a   big   difference .   the   dryer   also   comes   with   a   diffuser   but   that   s   for   completely   different   hair   than   i   have .   2   power   my   stylist   gave   me   a   number   of   watts   and   i   don   t   remember   the   number   but   this   unit   exceeds   it .   this   is   something   to   be   careful   of   anyway .   we   had   an   electrician   looking   at   a   problem   with   blowing   the   bathroom   circuit   and   he   said   it   s   common   for   new   hairdryers   to   blow   the   circuits   on   old   houses   because   new   ones   are   so   much   more   powerful .   that   turned   out   not   to   be   our   circuit   problem   but   thought   i   d   mention   that   there   are   practical   limits   to   high   power   that   are   a   pain   to   cross .   this   dryer   puts   out   all   the   heat   my   scalp   can   take .   3   cleanable   vent   the   back   grille   should   be   easy   to   open   clean   out   lint .   major   impact   on   strength   of   the   fan   on   life   span   of   the   appliance   if   you   keep   the   lint   out .   4   3   heat   settings   5   3   fan   settings   this   unit   is   actually   a   compromise   with   only   two   fan   speeds   off   but   i   always   use   high   anyway   cause   i   m   impatient   6   swivel   cord   vs .   retractable   cord   my   hairdresser   said   she   looks   for   a   swivel   cord   but   it   was   pretty   well   impossible   to   find   in   less   expensive   models   even   in   beauty   supply   stores   realize   pros   pay   over   100   for   professional   hairdryers   i   looked   high   and   low   for   this   feature .   it   probably   extended   my   search   for   a   new   hairdryer   by   almost   a   full   year .   i   finally   gave   up   on   it   when   i   set   my   sights   on   a   retractable   cord .   the   retractable   feature   also   seems   to   keepthe   cord   tangle   free .   my   curling   iron   has   a   swivel   cord   but   it   gets   more   tangled   because   it   gets   all   scrunched   up   in   the   drawer .   my   biggest   concern   was   that   the   retractable   cord   would   give   out   but   it   s   still   going   strong   after   1   1   2   years .   i   love   this   feature   as   it   keeps   my   dryer   neatly   tucked   away   in   its   drawer .   7   cold   shot   my   hairdresser   didn   t   include   this   feature   because   she   doesn   t   use   it   but   i   wouldn   t   buy   a   dryer   without   it .   this   is   a   button   that ,   when   pushed   in ,   makes   the   dryer   switch   to   unheated   air   which   sets   a   curl   curve   much ,   much   better .   it   takes   a   little   more   time   to   style   the   hair   which   is   why   hairdressers   often   don   t   use   it   but   my   style   lasts   days   longer .   easy   feature   to   find   but   it   s   not   universal   so   if   you   want   it   you   need   to   check   for   it   and   this   dryer   does   have   it .   it   s   the   blue   button   on   the   top   of   the   handle .   bottom   line   i   love   this   dryer .   if   it   s   been   a   while   since   you   bought   a   new   one ,   go   for   it .   you   ll   be   amazed   at   what   a   time   saver   it   is .   at   this   price   from   amazon ,   it   s   a   great   value .   in   my   area   target   walmart   sell   this   dryer   for   5   more   plus   tax .   i   d   buy   it   again   in   a   heart   beat .
best   dryer   ever   this   hair   dryer   was   purchased   for   my   daughter   in   law .   she   said   it   cuts   hair   drying   time   down   in   half   and   her   hair   has   so   much   volume   after   using   it .   i   see   where   others   say   it   doesn   t   last   very   long .   her   old   one   was   this   same   brand   and   lasted   over   a   year .   and   our   opinion   is   that   even   if   you   have   to   replace   it   after   a   year ,   its   worth   the   cost   and   time   to   do   so !  
excellent   wall   mount   hairdryer   we   bought   one   of   these   two   years   ago ,   for   our   remodeled   bathroom .   worked   perfectly ,   so   when   we   moved   into   our   new   house   in   2011 ,   we   bought   another   one .   again ,   works   perfectly ,   very   convenient ,   very   well   built .   two   criticisms   the   night   light   is   too   bright .   a   dimmer   on   the   side   would   be   much   preferred .   and ,   the   wall   anchors   that   come   with   it   really   suck .   you   ll   need   to   buy   a   set   of   anchors   to   mount   it   correctly .   that   said ,   we   re   buying   another   for   our   second   bathroom .   it   s   a   great   unit .
fine   i   was   given   this   for   christmas   and   i   m   baffled   by   the   reviews .   yes ,   it   s   a   little   hard   to   turn   on   and   it   s   a   little   loud .   but   i   don   t   think   that   warrants   1   2   star   ratings .   for   me ,   this   dryer   is   fantastic ,   it   seems   to   dry   3x   faster   than   my   old ,   old   dryer ,   and   i   haven   t   had   either   of   the   attachments   pop   off .   i   really   like   the   attachments ,   i   can   get   nice   volume   in   my   hair .   my   hair   is   naturally   very   thick   and   frizzy .   my   hair   is   still   frizzy   after   use   i   always   straighten   after   with   any   dryer   ,   however ,   it   is   less   frizzy   then   with   my   old   con   air   ion   dryer .   and   then ,   the   whole   dryer   folds   up   and   the   cord   retracts   awesome   !   so   i   give   it   4   stars .   the   stiff   buttons   and   loudness   are   my   only   dislikes ,   but   they   don   t   bother   me   that   much .
super   fast   to   dry   hair   i   have   long   hair   and   i   m   always   in   a   hurry   so   when   i   saw   this   has   twin   fans ,   i   bought   it .   it   really   does   the   drying   fast !   it   s   not   too   loud   the   sound   doesn   t   bother   me   like   some   dryers   do .   it   is   a   bit   heavy   but   other   than   that ,   i   m   very   happy   with   it .
heavy ,   loud ,   and   not   that   quick   to   dry   i   ve   used   so   many   different   hair   dryers ,   and   i   ve   always   focused   on   those   that   dry   quickly   and   delivers   much   air   flow   so   my   hair   doesn   t   feel   burned .   if   it   s   quiet ,   it   s   a   big   bonus .   br   br   my   favorite   is   this   http   www . amazon . com   sharper   image   ionic   conditioning   si745   dp   b00007m1u2   ref   cm   cr   pr   pb   t   ,   the   sharper   image   ionic   hair   dryer .   i   like   the   travel   version   because   it   s   light   weight ,   yet   delivers   just   as   much   power   and   air .   too   bad   this   is   no   longer   in   production .   br   br   i   also   enjoyed   this   http   www . amazon . com   healthy   infusions   wahl   pro   dryer   dp   b001e6g6fc   ref   cm   cr   pr   product   top   ,   and   i   use   it   as   my   alternative   hair   dryer   when   i   can   t   access   my   sharper   image   dryer .   this   one ,   too ,   delivers   great   air   flow   at   an   appropriate   temperature   and   dries   my   hair   quickly   and   gently .   br   br   now ,   to   our   product   at   hand ...   it   s   heavy   compares   to   the   two   i   had   just   mentioned .   it   s   not   any   more   quiet .   i   don   t   generally   use   the   air   diffuser   on   my   wahl ,   but   i   do   use   it   on   my   sharper   image .   i   tried   using   the   diffuser   with   this   remington ,   but   whether   i   use   it   or   not ,   my   hair   gets   very   tangled   afterward ,   which   isn   t   a   problem   with   neither   of   the   two   i   had   mentioned .   it   also   does   not   dry   quickly   as   the   title   implies ,   nor   does   it   make   my   hair   feel   anymore   healthy   than   before   i   use   it .   in   fact ,   rather   than   taking   half   the   time   to   dry   my   hair ,   i   think   it   doubles   the   time .   br   br   my   hair   is   past   the   middle   of   my   back ,   so   it   s   a   bit   long .   maybe   this   is   a   great   dryer   for   shorter   hair   i   don   t   know .   i   can   t   recommend   this   to   others .   on   the   bright   side ,   i   get   a   nice   work   out   with   my   right   arm   using   it ...   haha ...   br   br   two   stars ,   because   it   works .
not   impressed   the   one   good   thing   about   this   hair   dryer   is   that   it   is   quiet .   other   than   that ,   it   is   no   better   than   my   15 ,   ten   year   old   conair .   the   elchim   did   not   dry   my   hair   any   faster   and   my   hair   is   less   frizzy   when   i   let   my   hair   air   dry .   i   wanted   a   high   end   hair   dryer   and   was   disappointed .   i   didn   t   find   the   elchim   to   be   worth   the   price .
my   mom   loved   it   bought   this   for   my   mom   for   christmas .   let   me   tell   yah   it   was   a   real   chore   for   a   man   to   choose   a   blow   dryer   online   for   a   woman ,   but   the   price   and   weight   of   this   item   was   good .   i   especially   liked   that   it   has   a   4   year   warranty .
not   a   good   product   would   not   recommend   this   product .   it   is   heavy ,   loud ,   and   difficult   to   use   buttons .   buttons   do   not   change   positon   easily .   also   it   seems   to   short   out   my   electrical   circuit .   i   have   already   replaced   it .   does   not   dry   hair   faster   or   smoother   than   cheaper ,   lighter   versions .   would   not   recommend .
loud   hairdryer   i   placed   this   on   my   wishlist   and   it   was   purchased   for   me   for   christmas .   i   love   the   color   and   the   cord   keeper ,   however   it   is   very   very   loud   on   any   setting .
great   results ,   but   back   weighted   and   blows   the   breakers   i   usualy   get   these   types   of   hair   dryers ,   con   air   or   revlon ,   not   too   expensive   and   i   prefer   the   ones   with   two   switches   like   this   one   has   off ,   low ,   hi   and   a   cool ,   warm   hot   switch .   i   used   a   conair   1875   cord   keeper   on   vacation   so   i   added   this   to   my   wish   list   for   xmas .   i   have   wavy   curly   somewhat   course   and   frizzy   hair   which   i   blow   dry   straight .   this   makes   my   hair   so   soft   and   shiny   that   i   have   to   use   a   volumizing   gel   to   get   any   lift .   i   am   using   the   included   diverter   with   it ,   maybe   that   is   making   the   difference .   with   previous   hair   dryers   i   would   have   needed   to   flat   iron   to   get   it   this   smooth .   it   did   take   a   while   to   get   used   to   the   weight ,   it   is   heavy   and   the   handle   is   at   a   strange   angle   that   makes   it   harder   to   hold   than   previous   hair   dryers   i   ve   had .   also   i   really   was   surprised   at   how   much   power   this   draws ,   it   blows   the   breaker   if   i   have   lights   on   in   other   rooms .   my   husband   looked   and   said   it   draws   as   much   power   as   our   microwave !   generally   i   like   the   results ,   just   wish   it   was   more   comfortable   to   hold   and   didn   t   blow   the   breaker .   it   seems   to   run   less   hot   than   my   previous   revlon   1600 .   the   cord   keeper   function   is   nice .
john   frieda   hair   dryer   nice   hair   dryer ,   way   more   powerful   than   my   old   dryer .   makes   my   hair   a   bit   tangled ,   though ,   when   i   don   t   dry   it   right   away   before   my   mousse   begins   to   dry   and   set .   still   a   nice   dryer   for   the   price !
great   dryer !   i   really   love   this   little   dryer .   it   is   very   professional   looking   and   as   others   have   mentioned   it   is   feels   soft   and   velvety   to   the   touch .   it   dries   my   hair   quickly   and   is   not   too   loud ,   all   things   considered .   i   would   say   for   smoothing   it   is   not   a   miracle   worker ,   but   it   does   much   better   than   your   cheapie   dryers ,   and   can   help   an   amateur   like   me   control   the   frizz   somewhat .   i   think   super   smoothing   requires   more   proper   technique   than   just   a   magic   hair   dryer .   unfortunately   i   am   not   well   versed   in   that   technique ,   but   with   this   dryer   my   hair   doesn   t   look   too   frazzled   and   out   of   control .   my   only   issue   with   this   dryer   is   that   i   have   very   long   hair   and   sometimes   when   i   am   using   it   the   hair   gets   sucked   into   the   fan   on   the   back   end   of   the   dryer .   i   think   this   is   because   this   dryer   is   smaller   than   my   last   dryer   so   i   need   to   adjust   for   this   better .   overall   though ,   its   the   best   quality   for   the   price   i   have   had   in   a   dryer .
different   than   previous   models   i   ve   owned   3   of   these   hair   dryers   now .   they   would   break   after   a   year   or   so ,   but   given   the   low   price   and   quality   while   it   worked ,   i   had   no   problem   replacing   it .   this   newer   version   is   not   as   impressive .   the   eco   options   are   great   for   the   environment ,   but   it   takes   twice   as   long   to   dry   my   hair .   the   heat   is   no   where   near   even   the   middle   option   on   previous   versions .   might   be   great   for   those   who   don   t   need   a   quick   dry   and   like   the   lower   temperatures ,   but   it   was   not   what   i   am   looking   for .
perfect   dryer   it   was   a   great   deal ,   it   s   worth   the   price ,   my   wife   loves   it .   it   is   powerful ,   and   until   now   is   not   heating   in   excess .
great   product   and   customer   service .   even   when   a   small   problem   arose ,   customer   service   was   so   accommodating .   very   nice   dryer .   excellent   customer   service   and   very   prompt   responses .
works   well ,   does   not   make   my   hair   as   fabulous   as   ionic   dryer .   i   bought   this   after   my   chi   broke   and   i   read   the   amazon   reviews   that   recommended   this   dryer   as   very   reliable .   yes ,   it   is   reliable   and   it   works   well   but   i   really   prefer   the   ionic   dryers   as   opposed   to   the   high   pressure   for   drying   hair .   it   dries   quickly   like   ionic   but   does   not   leave   my   hair   and   smooth ,   soft   and   shiny   as   the   chi   did   i   mention   that   it   broke   after   6   months   .   so ,   i   am   keeping   this   for   awhile   but   next   time   i   get   a   gift   card   or   am   feeling   like   i   want   to   treat   myself ,   i   might   get   an   ionic   dryer   and   give   this   one   to   my   sister .
love   my   little   red   corvette   blow   dryer   baby ,   it   s   super   fast   yes   it   is !   .   i   used   to   use   the   blow   driers   with   the   brush   attachments ,   because   otherwise   my   hair   would   frizz   up .   well ,   they   stopped   making   them   so   i   stopped   blowing   my   hair   dry .   for   years .   last   week   i   used   the   remington   d3710   fast   finish   turbo   hair   dryer   because   i   had   a   party   to   go   to   and   i   fell   in   love   with   it   and   its   magical   defuser   attachment .   not   only   does   my   hair   dry   before   ten   minutes   pass ,   it   comes   out   straight   as   a   poker   when   i   use   the   defuser .   it   s   not   too   heavy   and   it   s   even   snazzy   looking .   just   seeing   it   cheers   me   up .   prince   might   prefer   purple ,   but   i   love   my   little   red   corvette   blow   dryer ...
works   amazing   i   have   thin   to   thick   hair   and   this   blow   dryer   does   the   trick !   it   dries   my   hair   quick   and   easy ! no   problems   so   far  
good   value   for   a   very   good   product !   i   had   an   andis   wall   mounted   hairdryer   previously   and ,   after   three   years   of   almost   daily   use ,   it   died .   wanted   a   replacement   and   felt   this   brand   was   reliable   and   reasonably   priced .   this   model   isn   t   as   powerful   as   my   other   one   however ,   it   s   fine   for   my   use ... i   have   very   short   hair !   i   read   some   of   the   complaints   regarding   difficulty   mounting   the   unit .   make   your   life   easy ... use   two   sided   tape   rather   than   drilling   holes   into   your   cabinet .   this   way   you   won   t   damage   the   cabinet   if   when   you   remove   it .   yes ,   the   nightlight   is   bright   but   if   you   find   it   objectionable ,   just   pull   out   the   plug   when   not   in   use .   i   would   definitely   recommend   this   product .
great   product   great   product   not   as   loud   as   other   hair   dryers ,   although   it   is   a   bit   heavier   because   of   the   material   its   made   of ... im   happy   with   it .   i   just   hope   it   last   longer   than   other   remington   products .
decent   product   andis   products   are   good   in   general   but   the   resin   comb   is   crap .   it   needs   to   be   a   hard   unbreakable   plastic   instead   because   it   won   t   last   for   use   in   the   salon .   also   the   picture   for   the   product   shows   3   attachments   and   i   only   received   a   nozzle   and   the   resin   comb .
worked   great   for   3   years   then   burned   out .   going   to   order   a   new   one   i   guess   for   30   in   is   worth   it .   worked   for   3   years   than   burned   out .   decided   to   order   another   one   since   i   have   the   wall   plate   already   on   the   wall .   i   guess   for   10   a   year   it   was   worth   it .   although   i   hate   to   throw   it   in   to   the   dump .
a   hurricane   dryer ! !   i   was   so   tired   of   wimpy   hairdryers   that   i   had   to   buy   this   hairdryer   after   reading   the   other   reviews .   the   reviews   are   correct .   the   air   that   comes   out   of   this   dryer   is   incredible   it   dries   my   hair   quickly ,   but   the   nice   thing   is   that   it   dries   your   hair   with   air   and   not   by   baking   it   with   intense   heat   it   is   hot ,   but   not   scorching .   a   great   purchase !
zero   stars   worst   dryer   i   ve   ever   purchased   my   wife   purchased   this   hairdryer   6   months   ago   to   replace   her   t3   and   it   now   only   blows   cold   air .   the   heating   element   does   not   function .   we   contacted   the   seller   for   warranty   information   and   never   received   a   reply .   we   d   give   it   zero   stars   if   that   was   possible .
great   this   hair   dryer   is   made   with   quality .   it   is   not   heavy ,   not   noisy ,   hot   and   offered   at   a   good   price .   amazon   did   a   great   job   wtih   sending   me   an   expedited   replacement   order   at   no   cost   to   me   when   my   original   order   was   lost   in   delivery .
secador   este   secador   fue   un   regalo   para   mi   esposa   y   le   encanto .   cumple   con   las   condiciones   de   un   buen   secador   de   cabello ,   potente ,   r   pido   y   no   da   a .   lo   recomiendo .
heavy   and   hard   to   hold   on   to   this   hair   dryer   styler   is   heavy   and   oxy   to   hold   on   to .   buttons   are   in   a   position   so   that   you   turn   it   off   when   drying   hair .   makes   hair   very   dull ,   big   and   fly   away .   definitely   will   not   recommend ! !
not   bad   this   hair   dryer   is   very   stylish !   i   love   the   aesthetics   of   it   and   it   has   this   super   long   cord   so   i   can   move   around   and   do   my   make   up   at   the   same   time   without   pulling   the   cord   out .   love   the   adjustable   heat   and   speed   selections .   the   highest   setting   is   too   hot   though   and   burnt   my   scalp   a   bit .   the   dryer   is   also   a   bit   heavy   so   makes   my   arms   a   bit   tired   but   besides   that ,   no   complaints !
a   little   disappointed   in   amazon   this   time ...   i   spent   a   lot   of   time   researching   which   hair   dryer   i   wanted   to   purchase   and   i   decided   the   conair   infiniti   cord   reel   was   exactly   what   i   was   looking   for .   i   always   go   to   amazon   first   when   making   a   purchase   so   naturally   i   checked   to   see   if   it   was   available .   it   was   in   stock ,   listed   for   a   great   price   and   also   included   free   super   saver   shipping   i   placed   my   order   right   away .   when   i   got   home   from   work   today   the   amazon   box   was   waiting   for   me   woo   hoo !   my   new   hair   dryer !   i   opened   the   box   and   instantly   knew   that   what   i   was   seeing   was   not   what   i   had   ordered .   it   was   made   by   conair ,   was   the   same   color ,   had   the   same   attachments   and   had   the   same   model   number   on   the   bottom   of   the   box   but   it   was   called   the   conair   you   reel   see   the   picture   i   posted   above   .   i   called   conair   to   find   out   if   they   had   changed   the   name   and   packaging   of   this   hair   dryer .   i   was   told   by   the   conair   customer   service   department   that   you   reel   is   a   subsidiary   of   conair   and   although   it   is   covered   by   the   same   warranty   as   the   infinti   it   is   not   the   infiniti .   i   called   amazon   customer   service   and   as   always   they   were   very   friendly   and   offered   to   either   send   me   another   hair   dryer   or   refund   my   money .   since   i   haven   t   even   plugged   the   hair   dyrer   in   yet   i   wanted   to   try   it   before   deciding   to   return   refund   it .   i   have   had   several   conair   hair   dryers   through   the   years   and   i   m   sure   this   one   will   be   just   fine   i   will   update   this   review   after   i   use   it   a   few   times   .   i   ve   never   had   any   problem   when   ordering   from   amazon   and   will   continue   to   do   so   but   i   just   wanted   to   warn   other   people   looking   at   this   hair   dryer   that   in   this   case   what   you   see   is   not   what   you   get .
uber   hairdryer   i   first   saw   this   a   couple   months   ago   my   new   hairdresser   was   using   it .   it   was   very   quiet ,   despite   the   ferrari   engine   printed   on   the   side !   i   commented   and   they   were   selling   them   there   260   for   a   400   hairdryer .   seemed   like   a   deal ,   but   a   lot   for   a   hairdryer ,   so   i   went   online   and   found   it   here   for   162 .   it   s   powerful   but   gentle ,   i   don   t   smell   hair   burning   like   with   cheaper   hairdryers .   the   only   possible   negative   you   should   know   is   that   it   s   a   little   heavy ,   heavier   than   i   m   used   to   with   the   20   cheapo   ones   from   marshalls ,   anyway !   but   i   don   t   care   i   love   it .
remington   d3710   ceramic   fast   finish   dual   fan   turbo   hair   dryer   for   years ,   literally ,   i   d   been   searching   for   a   powerful   hair   dryer ,   one   that   didn   t   cost   an   arm   and   a   leg .   this   is   it .   my   hair   is   thin   and   wimpy ,   but   still   takes   several   minutes   to   dry .   the   longer   it   takes   to   dry ,   the   frizzier   it   gets .   i   m   not   a   pro   when   it   comes   to   drying   my   hair .   far   from   it .   even   if   the   humidity   is   high ,   with   this   dryer   my   hair   dries   fast ,   frizz   free   and   straight .   it   is   heavy   for   my   arthritic   hands   and   arms ,   so   i   use   a   hair   dryer   stand ,   similar   to   ...   ,   that   i   purchased   many   years   ago   at   a   drug   store   in   their   made   for   tv   section .   i   haven   t   timed   it ,   but   it   seems   to   take   less   than   five   minutes   to   completely   dry   my   hair .   the   cord   is   approximately   six   feet   long ,   long   enough   for   my   use   since   i   don   t   walk   around   while   drying   my   hair .   the   temperature   and   air   control   on   the   handle   are   slide   levers .   with   arthritis ,   particularly   bad   in   my   thumbs ,   i   find   it   somewhat   difficult   to   adjust   them ,   thus   the   four   star   rating .   color   wise ,   i   d   describe   it   as   a   rich   salmon .   i   don   t   see   a   purpose   to   the   clear   encasement   over   the   dual   fans ,   but   that   doesn   t   bother   me   one   way   or   the   other .   over   all ,   i   m   very   glad   i   made   this   purchase   and   i   do   recommend   it   for   people   who   don   t   like   spending   a   lot   of   time   under   the   dryer .
best   blow   dryer   i   ve   ever   owned !   i   was   really   impressed   with   this   blow   dryer .   i   have   very   long   thick   hair   and   it   has   always   taken   me   at   least   ten   minutes   to   dry   it .   this   got   it   dry   in   5   minutes .   there   is   a   lot   of   power   to   it ,   and   i   like   the   fact   that   it   does   not   get   so   hot   that   you   can   get   it   close   to   your   scalp .   i   also   love   the   attatchments !   this   is   a   great   buy   and   worth   every   cent   of   the   money .   it   is   a   very   pretty   color   too .
my   first   one   worked   wonderfully   and   lasted   2   1   2   years ,   so   i   m   getting   another !   i   am   so   entirely   pleased   with   this   hair   dryer   that   i   m   coming   back   for   another   one ...   2   1   2   years   later .   i   ve   burned   through   cheaper ,   store   bought   hair   dryers   in   the   past .   i   bought   an   andis   many   years   ago   and   it   was   wonderful ,   so   i   bought   this   model   in   june   2009 ,   and   sadly   today   in   december   2011   it   finally   fizzled   out .   br   br   the   dryer   works   extremely   quickly .   i   remember   comparing   it   to   the   past   model   i   had ,   and   the   reason   i   ve   stuck   with   andis   since   because   of   their   efficiency   and   longevity   .   i   have   naturally   loose   curly   hair ,   and   i   use   this   dryer   daily   to   straighten   my   hair   with   a   round   brush .   it   allows   my   hair   to   retain   a   lot   of   body ,   come   out   super   soft ,   and   avoid   frizz !   br   br   while   the   switches   on   the   handle   are   kind   of   in   a   bad   place ,   i   eventually   got   used   to   it   and   rarely   do   i   accidentally   turn   it   off .   it   s   not   hard   to   turn   back   on ,   so   i   don   t   see   it   as   that   big   of   an   issue .   br   br   i   ve   had   great   customer   service   experience   with   andis   in   the   past   as   well .   the   plastic   piece   that   holds   the   filter   on   the   back   of   the   dryer   at   the   air   intake   broke   and   no   longer   functioned .   i   also   broke   one   of   the   attachments .   i   called   their   customer   service   number   and   they   replaced   both   items   free   of   charge ,   even   though   i   d   had   the   dryer   for   more   than   a   year !
great   hairdryer   this   is   a   great   hairdryer .   since   i   have   relatively   short   hair ,   i   use   this   product   primarily   for   my   daughter   6   years   old   .   she   like   many   other   children   is   picky   about   who   dries   her   hair ,   and   how   her   hair   is   dried .   she   is   blessed   with   hair   that   when   blow   dried   looks   beautiful ,   but   unfortunately   the   process   requires   working   through   the   many   knots   she   routinely   achieves   in   her   hair .   i   ve   found   that   this   hair   dryer   dries   her   hair   faster   than   hair   dryers   that   i   have   used   previously .   its   a   great   hair   dryer ,   its   dual   action   fans   give   out   more   air ,   thus   drying   hair   faster   than   ever   before .   this   has   been   a   great   addition   to   my   routine   because   it   helps   accomplish   the   task   a   lot   quicker   than   with   other   hair   dryers .   the   hair   dryer   has   several   settings ,   and   when   on   the   high   setting   i   can   dry   hair   in   less   than   5   minutes ,   which   is   fantastic   for   me .   i   ve   been   pleasantly   surprised   by   this   hairdryer .
turbo   fan   but   on   the   heavy   side   i   look   for   two   main   things   with   a   hair   dryer   the   fan   output   and   the   ease   of   use   with   settings .   this   hair   dryer   worked   great   on   both   accounts !   br   br   the   turbo   fan   was   excellent .   it   definitely   dries   your   hair   faster .   i   have   fairly   thick   hair   and   it   usually   takes   me   several   minutes   to   get   my   hair   from   wet   from   the   shower   to   dry .   the   remington   d3710   cut   my   drying   time   in   half .   i   also   liked   the   turbo   button   that   clicked   into   place   so   you   don   t   have   to   hold   it   down   the   whole   time .   br   br   the   settings   are   easy   to   figure   3   heat   and   2   speed   settings   with   turbo .   the   dryer   does   not   run   hot   at   all .   i   usually   like   a   hotter   drying   hair   dryer   because   it   seems   to   set   my   style   easier .   however ,   with   the   turbo   speed ,   i   didn   t   have   any   problems .   in   fact ,   i   prefer   it   because   it   gives   me   more   volume   and   doesn   t   leave   heat   damage .   br   br   my   only   complaint   is   that   the   dryer   is   quite   heavy   and   a   little   bulky   to   accommodate   the   bigger   fan   .   since   it   takes   less   time ,   i   don   t   mind   it   but   if   you   have   issues   with   arthritis   this   may   be   a   real   problem .
great   dryer ,   just   a   little   heavy   as   the   name   implies ,   this   hair   dryer   is   faster   than   average .   it   has   ionic   tourmaline   ceramic   to   enhance   drying   speed .   it   is   not   red   but   a   deep ,   darker   pink ... like   cherry   pepto   bismol   ...   it   is   just   a   little   heavier   than   average   so   if   you   have   long ,   thick   hair   you   may   have   to   arrange   some   kind   of   stand   for   the   dryer   for   part   of   your   drying   time   to   avoid   wrist   fatigue .   the   1875   watts   may   be   a   problem   in   older   dwellings   which   haven   t   been   updated   for   modern   electric   needs ...   but   not   for   the   majority .   we   found   it   to   be   an   excellent   product .   best   wishes .   2   year   limited   warranty   features   3   heat   settings   2   air   speed   settings   turbo   button   cool   air   button   diffuser   attachment   concentrator   attachment   removable   filter
a   bit   heavy   but   very   powerful   this   hair   dryer   works   great   and   it   is   cool   seeing   the   fans   through   the   clear   plastic   but   it   is   bigger   and   heavier   than   other   hair   dryers   i   have   used   it   s   not   outrageously   bulky   but   it   different .   the   attachments   are   nice   and   the   power   cord   is   sufficiently   long   that   you   aren   t   bound   to   your   outlet .   overall   a   very   good ,   almost   professional   quality ,   hair   dryer .

good ,   but   not   for   thicker   than   most   hair .   i   ordered   this   because   of   the   price   and   the   reviews .   it   s   a   decent   hair   dryer   but   the   bristle   attachment   the   only   one   i   had   planned   to   use   was   flimsy .   flimsy   in   a   way   that   the   bristles   bend   from   pressure   easily   so   if   you   have   a   lot   of   hair ,   it   wont   go   all   the   way   through .   i   would   suggest   this   item   for   people   with ,   at   most ,   normal   thickness   hair .   i   would   not   suggest   this   item   for   women   of   darker   skin .   i   myself   am   caucasian   but   i   have   medium   thickness ,   curly   hair   and   i   can   just   barely   use   it .   i   have   to   use   the   comb   attachments   and   thats   not   very   fun .   i   suggest   this   item   mostly   for   women   with   a   little   but   of   curl   that   they   want   to   straighten   out .
wonderful   product   just   a   little   too ....   heavy .   it   was   advertised   as   light   weight   but   its   not   really .   it   is   not   the   heaviest   blow   dryer   but   still   i   was   a   llittle   surprised   at   the   weight .   other   than   that   it   is   excellent   my   daughter   s   hair   is   soft   wavy   and   frizzy   and   long .   it   takes   a   lot   to   straighten   it   out   but   this   dryer   left   her   hair   soft   and   straight   with   a   wonderful   shine   to   it .   i   would   and   have   recommend   this   to   others .
not   that   great   the   cord   is   convenient ,   but   its   not   long   enough .   and   the   power   is   not   strong   enough   the   blowing   action   .   i   would   have   returned   it   but   i   was   moving   at   the   time   and   didnt   have   time   to   do   it .
fast   and   no   frizzies   a   very   nice   hair   dryer   that   has   a   diffuser   for   those   of   us   with   curly   hair .   it   s   not   really   a   mini ,   but   it   s   not   super   huge   either .   it   lives   up   to   the   no   frizzie   reviews   and   dries   your   hair   extremely   fast .   there   are   3   heat   settings   and   2   speed   settings .   it   dries   fast   even   at   medium   heat   and   low   speed .   there   is   also   a   cool   button   that   cancels   all   heat   and   locks   your   style ,   it   also   cools   your   head   down   before   you   go   out   in   the   cold   winter   air .   it   is   heavier   than   most   hair   dryers .   i   would   buy   it   again .
what   a   hair   dryer !   this   is   absolutely   the   best   hair   dryer   i   ve   ever   owned !   if   you   have   thick   hair   like   mine   then   it   will   blow   you   away   at   how   fast   this   dryer   dries   hair .   it   takes   half   the   time   to   dry   hair   as   it   states .   it   has   2   fans ,   and   you   can   take   the   cap   off   the   filter   to   clean   the   hair ,   etc .   out   of   it   to   keep   it   working   smoothly .   love   the   red   color !   it   has   a   turbo   boost   if   needed   which   i   didn   t .   it   has   a   choice   of   settings   to   meet   each   person   s   like   of   heat   and   power .   it   has   all   the   power   a   person   needs   to   get   the   job   done !   it   s   a   little   heavy   to   hold   but   in   my   opinion   it   doesn   t   make   your   arms   tired   because   your   done   before   that   happens .
it   serves   it   s   purpose   lightweight   and   easy   to   use .   i   purchased   this   haridryer   for   one   reason   i   broke   both   of   my   elbows   in   a   fall   and   needed   to   have   a   lightweight   dryer   to   use   after   the   splints   came   off .   this   hairdryer   is   by   far   the   lightest   i   have   seen   and   it   has   been   easy   for   me   to   use .   this   may   be   important   for   people   with   muscle   nerve   arthritic   issues   and   should   be   considered   for   this   reason .   there   are   only   two   speeds   and   settings   so   you   can   not   have   high   heat   on   a   low   speed   and   visa   versa .
hair   dryer   it   was   more   than   i   expected ,   package   was   deluxe   and   product   quality   is   super .   i   am   in   love   with   my   hair   dryer .
not   what   i   ordered   this   dryer   no   longer   includes   the   straightener   attachment   as   pictured   and   referred   to   by   previous   customers .   it   is   also   black   and   white .   i   got   one   that   had   item   number   121pr ,   returned   it ,   and   got   the   same   thing   with   the   item   number   121px .   be   aware   this   item   is   not   as   shown .   i   did   not   try   it   because   it   was   wrong .
super   fast !   this   is   the   most   amazing   dryer !   three   heat   settings ,   two   speed   settings ,   a   turbo   speed   wow !   my   hair   gets   dried   fast !   it   s   not   a   heavy   dryer   to   hold   either   which   means   that   it   s   easier   to   maneuver   into   whatever   weird   position   you   need   it   and   with   the   concentrator   and   diffuser   i   get   a   nice   blow   out   and   no   frizzles !   one   of   my   fav   things   too   is   that   it   has   a   filter   that   you   can   take   out   and   clean   once   in   a   while   just   in   case   you   are   in   a   habit   of   spraying   product   while   you   blow   like   i   am   then   you   don   t   have   to   worry   about   gunking   up   the   filter .   great   dryer   i   ll   never   use   a   hotel   dryer   again   cause   this   one   is   traveling   with   me !
light   weight   my   hair   become   shiny   smooth   the   hairdryer   looks   elegant ,   of   very   light   weight .   i   used   high   warm   speed   to   blow   dry   then   used   medium   hot   to   style   my   bob .   i   do   have   some   problem   though   to   set   the   right   side   of   my   hair   using   my   left   hand .   it   is   not   very   intuitive   with   the   design   of   the   shape .
so   heavy   the   moment   i   pulled   the   dryer   out   of   the   box ,   i   thought   wow ,   it   s   really   heavy   comparing   to   my   old   dryer .   i   love   the   color ,   but   color   is   not   the   main   feature   to   consider   when   buying   a   hair   dryer ,   right   i   haven   t   tried   it   and   afraid   i   will   not   be   using   it ,   since   i   am   not   loving   it .   probably ,   it   will   go   back   to   the   store   it   didn   t   come   from   amazon   .
oster   wall   mount   hair   dryer   awesome !   over   10   years   ago   i   bought   a   wall   mounted   blow   dryer   after   using   it   in   a   hotel   while   on   a   business   trip .   i   loved   it !   when   that   died ,   i   couldn   t   find   a   dryer   in   any   retail   store   that   came   close   to   its   quality   and   durability .   well ,   i   have   now !   the   oster   wall   mounted   dryer   is   easy   to   set   up   and   easier   to   use .   it   s   powerful ,   but   compact .   it   dries   my   hair   faster ,   and   styles   it   better   than   any   product   i   ve   used   to   date .   no   popped   circuit   breakers ,   either ,   so   i   know   it   uses   less   energy .   i   won   t   be   needing   another   blow   dryer   for   the   next   decade .   and   is   that   ever   nice !
poor   quality   the   dryer   light   stopped   working   after   3   weeks .   it   did   not   matter   much .   today ,   exactly   1   year   and   3   days   after   my   purchase   the   on   off   switch   stopped   working   and   i   had   to   use   the   breaker   on   the   unit   to   turn   it   off .   i   called   the   manufacturer   and   confirmed   that   the   warranty   is   1   year ,   but   since   it   is   just   couple   of   days   over ,   they   agreed   to   send   me   a   replacement .   it   is   a   direct   connect   so   i   need   to   take   the   wiring   out   and   replace   it   with   a   new   one .   oh   well ! ,   at   least   i   got   a   replacement .
terrific   great   little   inexpensive   sturdy   hair   dryer .   because   i   m   on   a   healthy   hair   journey   i   was   looking   for   a   hair   dryer   that   wouldn   t   expose   my   hair   to   too   much   direct   heat   so   the   styling   attachments   act   as   a   something   of   a   barrier   between   the   dryer   and   the   hair   and   i   can   get   my   4a   b   textured   hair   relatively   straight   on   medium   heat   a   few   passes   using   the   larger   if   the   2   comb   attachments   when   i   need   to   do   a   trim   or   a   length   check .
died   early   this   is   a   good   dryer   while   it   lasts .   quiet ,   good   heat ,   not   too   heavy .   but   i   have   owned   it   less   than   six   months   and   yesterday   it   stopped   producing   heat ,   just   blew   cold   air .   br   br   update   i   just   called   remington .   they   warranty   the   product   for   three   years   and   are   sending   me   a   new   dryer .   no   hassle .
his   her   s   hair   dyers   mounted   both   items   in   the   master   bathroom .   i   m   completely   satiefied   with   them .   strong   air   flow , nice   cord   length   and   easy   instalation .
remington   ac2015   hair   dryer   it   s   very   powerful   and   quite .   the   finish   is   also   cool   and   professional   looking .   just   a   little   bit   heavy   than   the   one   i   had .
best   hair   dryer   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   based   on   a   recommendation   from   good   housekeeping   and   other   amazon   reviews .   it   s   powerful ,   dries   and   styles   my   very   thick   and   long   hair   in   a   fraction   of   the   time   my   old   hair   dryer   did .   only   drawback   it   s   a   bit   heavy .
sad   so   i   haven   t   used   it   yet   but   i   was   pretty   angry   to   realize   that   i   paid   double   the   price .   i   had   no   idea   where   to   look   for   this   dryer   and   of   course   my   always   trusting   amazon   had   it   but   when   i   went   to   target   i   saw   it   for   19.99 .   i   am   a   little   upset ,   probably   fair   game   but   nonetheless   sad .
powerful !   i   love   this   little , lightweight   hair   dryer .   i   used   it   at   a   motel   in   point   pleasant ,   n . j .   i   could   not   wait   to   purchase   my   own .   more   powerful   than   my   other   dryer   with   a   lot   more   voltage .
it   is   working   great !   got   this   for   over   a   month   now .   it   is   working   great .   i   usually   do   not   dry   my   hair ,   but   living   in   ne   there   are   a   lot   of   snow   days   in   the   winter .   i   need   to   dry   my   hair   before   i   head   out .   i   am   very   satisfied   with   this   hair   dryer .
excellent   no   complains ,   my   wife   use   it   every   day .   good   hair   dryer ,   oster   professional   76932   710   wall   mount   hair   dryer   great ! .
conair   1875   compact   styler   my   wife   love   this .   its   very   compact   with   a   folding   handle .   it   has   an   option   for   warm   or   normal   air .   much   more   is   that   it   s   auto   volt   so   you   can   use   it   anywhere .   a   true   travel   dryer   styler .   highly   recommended .
loud   got   weird   noises .   i   am   just   not   happy   with   the   really   loud   noise .   i   bought   this   based   on   the   product   s   the   minimal   negative   reviews   and   customers   reviewing   it   quiet .   other   than   the   really   loud   noise   of   the   dryer   even   at   its   lowest   mode   and   the   odd   noise   it   makes   when   being   held   facing   up   and   at   the   cool   and   warm   modes ,   the   dryer   is   very   solid   and   a   quite   heavy .   i   tried   the   attached   concentrator ,   the   wind   would   not   concentrate   when   blowing   extremely   closed   with   my   ceramic   round   brush .   br   br   extreme   fast   shipping   and   fast   refund .   still   a   happy   customer   after   the   good   service .  
definitely   worth   it ! !   i   love   this   blow   dryer !   i   have   gone   through   about   five   now ,   and   of   all   of   them   this   is   the   best   one .   it   gets   my   hair   straighter   and   silky .   it   always   has   a   good   shine   and   never   leaves   that   static   cling   effect .   also   all   of   the   attachments   are   great ! !
retractable   cord   retracted   for   about   a   month   this   hair   dryer   does   a   very   fine   job   of   dryng   my   hair .   however ,   i   am   not   sure   i   have   ever   had   a   hand   held   dryer   which   did   not .   the   reason   i   purchased   this   dryer   was   for   its   retractability .   this   feature   worked   great   for   about   a   month .   now ,   i   cannot   seem   to   get   it   to   completely   retract   maybe   5   inches   at   most .   it   is   too   bad   i   really   liked   the   idea .
highly   recommended   bought   this   to   replace   a   higher   wattage   hair   dryer .   we   would   keep   tripping   circuit   breakers   with   the   old   hair   dryer   1800w ,   i   think   since   it   nearly   maxed   out   the   15a   circuit .   this   lower   wattage   hair   dryer   still   seems   to   dry   hair   just   fine   and   just   as   fast   i   think   fan   speed   has   more   to   do   with   drying   time   than   high   wattage   .   the   textured   plastic   surface   is   easy   to   grip   and   the   small   size   makes   it   easy   to   pack   for   trips .   hightly   recommended .
absolutely   fantastic   hair   dryer   i   absolutely   love   this   hair   dryer .   i   have   long   and   very   very   thick   hair ,   so   i   need   a   powerful   dryer   i   ve   tried   many   of   the   dryers   one   could   find   at   the   local   rite   aid   or   cvs   and   even   after   an   hour   my   hair   would   still   not   be   entirely   dry   .   this   one   does   the   job   in   about   20   minutes   and   it   is   also   very   small   and   relatively   light   weight .   from   what   i   ve   looked   at ,   this   is   the   strongest   travel   size   hair   dryer   out   there   and   after   taking   it   with   me   on   a   3   state   spanning   business   trip   i   was   very   glad   with   the   fact   that   it   was   half   the   size   and   much   stronger   than   my   old   solano   which ,   for   the   record ,   i   love ,   but   is   just   really   large   and   inconvenient   to   lug   around   in   a   suitcase   .   i   also   love   that   the   dryer   has   a   loop   so   that   i   could   hang   it   on   a   hook   as   my   bathroom   doesn   t   have   much   storage   space   .   i   would   recommend   this   to   everyone ,   especially   if   you   need   something   you   can   travel   with .   my   next   purchase   will   be   the   2400w   babyliss ,   once   i   can   find   it   in   the   us .
best   dryer   i   ve   ever   owned   but   not   without   flaws   i   bought   this   dryer   to   replace   an   old   cheapo   remington   hair   dryer   that   i   bought .   the   remington   didn   t   last   me   long   less   than   a   year   and   in   general   was   a   mediocre   hair   dryer   but   it   got   the   job   done .   br   br   i   ll   start   with   the   cons   i   have   thick   long   straight   hair   with   a   natural   wave ,   my   day   to   day   hair   style   is   scrunched .   i   have   a   universal   diffuser   that   i   love   to   use ,   it   s   huge   and   has   high   sides   that   are   easy   to   scoop   my   long   hair   into .   unfortunately   the   first   thing   i   noticed   about   the   john   frieda   hair   dryer   is   the   unusual   shape   of   the   nozzle .   it   is   big   and   short   and   my   universal   diffuser   does   not   fit   it ,   nor   will   any   universal   diffuser   on   the   market   at   least   i   haven   t   found   one   yet   .   so   i   m   forced   to   use   the   attached   diffuser   that   came   with   it .   it   does   the   job   but   it   s   not   as   easy   to   use   as   my   old   one .   the   buttons   are   also   in   a   very   awkward   place ,   right   where   my   thumb   sits   when   i   m   holding   it   so   i   m   constantly   turning   the   temperature   down   by   accident .   i   also   end   up   hitting   the   cool   shot   button   all   the   time .   it   takes   some   adjustment   to   get   used   to .   br   br   otherwise ,   this   hair   dryer   is   excellent ,   it   s   extremely   powerful .   it   has   cut   my   hair   drying   time   down   by   half .   most   of   the   time   i   don   t   even   use   it   on   full   heat .   if   you   don   t   use   a   diffuser   or   aren   t   married   to   using   a   larger   universal   one ,   i   would   definitely   recommend   this   hair   dryer .   if   it   wasn   t   so   awesome ,   i   would   probably   return   it   for   not   fitting   my   diffuser   but   i   think   using   the   included   one   will   be   an   okay   compromise   for   me .
works   very   well   but   is   a   little   heavy   since   i   am   using   this   on   almost   a   daily   basis   to   take   to   and   from   the   gym   i   find   it   to   be   a   little   more   heavy   than   i   would   prefer .   however ,   it   works   well   and   dries   pretty   quickly   with   minimal   frizz .   i   like   that   it   has   the   cool   shot   option .   i   ended   up   getting   the   baby   bliss   travel   dryer   because   it   is   about   1   2   the   weight   and   i   really   like   it .   however ,   it   doesn   t   have   the   cool   temp   option   so   i   m   hanging   onto   this   one   for   backup .
this   is   one   of   the   best   blow   dries   you   will   ever   find   i   am   a   hair   dresser   in   nyc .   i   typically   need   a   new   blow   drier   ever   year   or   so .   usually   i   buy   this   one .   when   i   haven   t   and   i   have   tried   other   driers   and   there   have   been   many !   they   are   never   as   good   as   this   one .   if   you   are   shopping   for   an   at   home   drier   this   will   last   forever .   it   is   very   light ,   its   fast ,   its   hot .   you   can   turn   the   ionic   function   off   which   if   you   have   coarser   frizzier   hair   that   is   what   you   need   anyway   .   it   is   also   pretty   hardy .   my   tools   get   dropped   all   the   time .   other   driers   crack   and   stop   working   quickly ,   but   not   this   one .   you   can   t   go   wrong   here ,   and   the   diffuser   that   goes   with   this   drier   is   really   great   too .   enjoy !
best   hair   dryer   i   have   ever   owned   the   remington   ac2015   tstudio   salon   collection   pearl   ceramic   is   a   wonderful   hair   dryer .   it   is   very   noticeably   quieter   than   any   other   hair   dryer   i   have   ever   had .   compared   to   other   dryers   i   have   used ,   it   leaves   my   long   straight   hair   full   of   body   and   never   adds   static   electricity .   it   is   definitley   worth   the   33.99   i   paid   for   it .
great   hair   dryer !   it   s   nice   to   buy   a   product   that   actully   performs   exactly   as   it   was   described   in   the   marketing   materials .   there   s   definitely   some   valid   technology   that   keeps   your   hair   from   frizzing   out .   very   happy   with   this   unit .   so   far ,   this   is   the   best   hair   dryer   i   ve   ever   used .
liked   hair   dryer !   i   like   the   hair   dryer   very   much .   my   old   one   was   really   loud .   this   is   not   at   all .   nice   color .   very   pleased   i   bought   it .
andis   hair   dryer   this   hair   dryer   is   the   best   we   have   found   yet .   it   puts   out   a   concentrated   stream   of   air   that   is   not   too   hot   but   drys   your   hair   quickly .   it   has   an   easy   to   use   mount   for   the   dryer .   only   negative   is   the   instructions   for   mounting   on   the   wall ,   which   are   backward ,   but   once   mounted   it   is   a   joy .
don   t   waste   your   money   after   using   this   hair   dryer   for   six   months   i   finally   got   so   fed   up   with   it   that   i   broke   down   and   got   myself   a   babyliss .   with   the   conair   the   cord   is   too   short ,   i   do   not   like   the   angle   of   the   handle ,   it   s   so   heavy   i   repeatedly   bumped   myself   on   the   head   with   it ,   it   s   noisy ,   though   i   wonder   why   because   there   is   little   air   flow ,   and ,   worst   of   all ,   it   does   not   work   any   better   than   my   old   non   ionic   hair   dryer .   that   one   was   at   least   quick .   i   have   naturally   straight   hair ,   fine   but   lots   of   it ,   and   it   took   me   more   than   10   min   to   blow   my   short   style   dry .   i   don   t   even   want   to   imagine   that   with   long   hair !   in   the   end   my   hair   looked   so   shaggy   and   messy   that   i   honestly   told   my   hair   dresser   to   step   up   her   game   or   else .   only   when   i   recently   visited   my   parents   and   used   my   mom   s   hair   dryer   i   realized   that   the   cause   for   my   chaotic   mop   was   this   hair   dryer .   br   oh ,   and   conair   donates   only   one   dollar   from   the   sale   of   each   hair   dryer .
runs   good   wife   likes   it ,   so   i   m   happy .   anything   to   keep   that   nag   off   my   back .   loud ,   which   is   a   good   thing ,   can   t   hear   the   ball   and   chain   complaining   about   the   bathroom   walls ,   sink ,   toilet ,   mirrors ,   lights ,   outlets ,   shower .   safe ,   unfortunately .  
great   product   my   wife   has   tried   many   hairdryers   and   i   couldn   t   believe   how   satisfied   she   was   with   this   hair   dryer ...   totally   worth   it !
died   an   early   death   and   no   return   i   suppose   amazon   wants   more   than   twenty   word   reviews   so   no   one   can   just   say ,   the   product   sucks !   but   that   is   somewhat   appropriate .   it   is   also   true   about   the   manufacturer   s   return   policy .   i   was   looking   for   an   extra   long   cord ,   and   found   this   one .   i   hadn   t   planned   on   retracting   the   cord   each   time ,   as   that   seemed   like   it   would   shorten   the   time   the   dryer   lasted .   but   i   did   it   once ,   and   it   was   trouble   to   not   get   it   past   the   red   line .   the   dryer   handle   was   also   was   very   large ,   and   hard   to   hold   without   my   hand   cramping .   still ,   i   kept   it ,   as   the   ionic   feature   seemed   to   be   good   for   straightening   out   my   curly   hair .   after   less   than   two   months ,   the   power   button   died ,   and   i   could   not   turn   it   off .   i   had   to   reset   the   outlet .   when   i   checked   about   returns ,   it   would   cost   me   10.00   for   the   return ,   and   they   would   only   return   half   of   the   purchase   price .   so   i   would   wind   up   with   around   5.00   for   my   trouble .   and   i   still   wouldn   t   have   a   dryer   to   use ,   as   i   did   not   want   to   have   it   replaced .   i   wonder   if   the   company   has   this   policy   so   no   one   will   bother   to   return   the   item  
hair   dryer   bought   for   our   motor   home .   installed   easily   and   works   great .   it   is   small   enough   to   be   out   of   the   way   yet   has   the   power   needed .
little   hair   blower   with   big   power   although   this   hair   blower   is   small   in   size ,   it   actually   dries   hair   quite   quickly .   small   size   makes   putting   it   out   of   sight   after   using   really   easy .   love   the   andis   hair   products
amazing   how   quickly   it   works !   i   have   thick   hair   that   is   almost   to   the   bottom   of   my   lower   back   or   top   of   my   bottom ,   lol   .   standard   hair   dryers   max   capacity   that   cost   more   took   at   least   double   the   time   to   get   my   hair   from   wet   to   dry .   it   s   amazing .   i   love   that   it   has   the   ionic   capability   and   the   cool   air ,   to   help   decrease   the   frizzie   s   and   keep   my   hair   style   set .   not   that   hair   that   long   has   much   style .   it   did   come   with   attachments   that   i   have   no   idea   what   their   purpose   is ,   so   those   are   kind   of   a   waste .   i   was   initially   concerned   the   first   few   days   because   the   temp .   seemed   to   be   fluctuating ,   however   after   a   few   uses   it   smoothed   out .   the   cord   is   really   long ,   which   is   great   because   the   only   outlet   i   have   in   my   bathroom   has   ruined   several   blow   dryers   by   melting   the   plug .   so   i   m   easily   able   to   plug   in   else   where   an   still   reach   the   bathroom .   i   m   thrilled   that   drying   my   hair   is   not   a   ten   to   fifteen   minute   ordeal ,   closer   to   five .   every   minute   counts   when   your   getting   ready .
defective   or   low   quality   i   am   not   sure   if   i   purchased   a   defective   dryer ,   but   the   first   time   i   used   it   the   motor   started   making   a   high   pitched   noise ,   and   the   air   stopped   coming   out   in   a   steady   stream .   i   thought   maybe   it   was   just   warming   up   but   the   next   time   i   used   it ,   it   did   the   same   thing ,   with   the   air   only   coming   out   in   puffs .   the   motor   was   so   loud ,   it   sounded   as   if   it   were   going   to   start   smoking .

if   it   was   supposed   to   black   silver ,   someone   must   be   color   blind   the   blow   dryer   delivered   to   me   was   white   and   black ... it   was   not   the   silver   black   that   i   ordered   but   it   does   dry   my   hair .
and   is   rc   2   ionic1875w   ceramic   hair   dryer   this   hair   dryer   works   great .   my   first   purchase   broke   after   just   two   weeks ,   the   heating   element   became   too   hot   and   the   hairdryer   shut   off .   my   replacement   however   has   been   fine .   drys   hair   quickly   and   leaves   it   feeling   smooth   and   silky .   it   is   light   weight   and   easy   to   hold   while   styling   with   a   brush   in   the   other   hand .
best   hairdryer   i   have   ever   owned .   i   have   finely   textured ,   shoulder   length   hair ,   but   a   lot   of   it ,   so   it   seems   to   take   forever   to   dry   it .   my   old   dryer   was   pretty   heavy ,   so   much   so   my   shoulder   would   begin   to   hurt   before   i   could   finish .   this   past   august ,   i   stayed   at   the   courtyard   by   marriott   while   moving   my   son   into   his   college   dorm .   having   to   pack   lightly   for   myself ,   i   counted   on   using   whatever   dryer   the   hotel   provided .   when   i   saw   how   small   the   andis   pro   style   1600   dryer   in   the   hotel   room   was ,   i   was   skeptical   of   its   power .   i   was   pleasantly   surprised !   in   addition   to   being   lightweight ,   it   was   very   effective .   i   remarked   to   my   husband   at   how   quickly   i   was   able   to   dry   my   hair   even   with   the   florida   humidity   and   that   i   wanted   one   of   the   dryers .   since   i   could   get   it   on   amazon   for   13.99 ,   i   thought   what   the   heck ,   i   won   t   be   gambling   too   much   if   it   doesn   t   work .   i   have   been   using   it   at   least   3   times   a   week   for   the   last   9   weeks   or   so   without   any   problems .   my   dogs   did   not   like   it   when   we   used   the   old   dryer   on   them   after   a   bath ,   but   it   is   almost   as   if   they   like   this   one !   of   course ,   i   do   wonder   how   long   a   14   hairdryer   will   last ,   but   my   hairstylist   told   me   andis   is   a   very   reputable   brand .   regardless ,   it   has   been   worth   every   penny .   highly   recommend !
garbage   i   bought   2   of   these   because   i   thought   they   were   very   similar   to   what   i   had   before .   each   lasted   about   2   uses   before   i   heard   something   break   inside   and   they   would   no   longer   turn   on .   no   matter   how   low   the   price   do   not   buy   this   hair   dryer !
not   worth   the   cons   low   speed   is   too   low ,   high   speed   is   too   high .   it   doesn   t   blow   hot   air   for   the   first   5   minutes .   speed   button   is   hard   to   control   quickly ,   i   always   go   past   the   off   when   i   want   it   to   switch   off .   it   reminds   me   of   cheap   hotel   blow   dryers .   the   back   doesn   t   have   a   filter ,   so   my   hair   gets   stuck   in   it   if   i   turn   wrong .   br   br   pros   it   was   cheap .   it   s   lightweight .   br   br   just   pay   3   more   for   the   better   model .
piece   of   garbage   john   frieda   jf   1   full   volume   hair   dryer   works   has   major   flaws   and   i   do   not   recommend   it .   the   first   and   most   major   problem   is   that   the   on   off   power   levels   are   right   where   your   hands   go ,   so   it   is   constantly   changing   power   levels .   the   only   way   around   that   is   to   hold   it   awkwardly .   it   is   also   very   heavy   and   loud .   finally ,   i   use   the   diffuser   attachment   and   it   constantly   falls   off .   today   a   chink   of   the   diffuser   fell   off   and   broke .   into   the   garbage .   i   a ,   going   to   buy   a   new   blow   dryer   and   this   junk   will   be   thrown   out .
i   love   my   dyer !   i   had   another   blow   dryer   just   like   this   one   and   it   finally   died   on   me .   i   went   in   search   of   it   at   all   the   local   stores .   i   couldn   t   find   it ,   so   i   bought   a   couple   other   ones   that   i   ended   up   returning ,   because   i   didn   t   like   them .   therefore ,   i   was   pretty   happy   when   i   found   this   close   match   on   amazon .   i   m   very   happy   with   it .
burnt   out   this   hairdryer   worked   as   advertised   for   about   10   months .   after   that   point ,   the   fan   stopped   working   and   it   got   really   hot   and   overheated   in   about   a   second .   we   ll   see   how   good   the   customer   service   is .
great   little   hair   dryer   i   ve   been   using   it   about   two   weeks   now   without   any   problems .   it   blows   a   strong   current   of   hot   hair .   it   takes   up   very   little   space   because   it   is   very   tiny .   but   being   tiny   doesn   t   mean   it   can   t   do   the   same   job   of   a   bigger   dryer ,   because   it   sure   does .
good   dryer ,   but   cord   is   not   retractable   the   hair   dryer   itself   works   pretty   well ,   but   the   retractable   cord   is   completely   misleading .   it   stopped   retracting   on   its   own   after   i   used   it   twice .   with   that   said ,   the   folding   handle   still   makes   it   easy   to   store .   good   buy   for   the   price .
buyer   beware   broke   after   3   months   the   dryer   broke   after   3   months   and   the   company   won   t   honor   the   warranty   because   amazon   is   not   an   authorized   seller .   but   the   company   told   me   that   for   a   mere   54.95   they   will   bend   the   rules   replace   it   for   me .   steer   clear .
chic   and   stylish ! !   any   girl   women   will   fall   in   love   with   the   look   of   this   dryer .   its   definitely   made   to   impress   anyone   who   is   looking   for   a   product   that   works   and   looks   great   too .   i   bought   it   for   the   same   reason .   i   own   a   remington   straightener   and   almost   can   t   live   without   it .   this   one   compliments   it   perfectly .   the   weight   of   the   dryer   is   perfect .   it   does   not   feel   heavy   and   is   comfortable   to   work   with .   i   wash   my   hair   almost   daily   and   this   dryer   comes   in   handy   every   time .   it   comes   with   bonus   diffuser   and   concentrator   attachments .   i   have   very   thin   and   fine   hair   and   the   diffuser   seems   like   its   made   for   a   person   with   thick   hair .   its   too   big   for   my   hair .   the   features   that   i   love   in   this   product   are   1 .   it   has   a   removable   air   intake   screen   which   make   cleanup   so   easy .   2 .   its   sleek   design   and   light   weight .   3 .   long   cord   and   heat   settings .   features   i   wish   were   addressed   1 .   it   makes   a   lot   of   noise   and   my   husband   always   complaints   about   that .   2 .   though   the   cord   is   long   and   convenient   for   usage ,   its   difficult   to   store   because   its   not   retractable .   overall   its   a   great   buy   and   i   can   see   myself   using   it   for   a   very   long   time .
great !   i   read   a   lot   of   reviews   before   purchasing   this ,   and   i   m   glad   i   listened   to   them .   this   is   a   powerful ,   easy   to   use   dryer .   it   gets   the   job   done ,   and   while   i   use   styling   products ,   it   does   help   make   it   somewhat   silky   smooth .   definitely   recommend .
excellent   product   love   it ,   love   it ,   love   it ! ! !   in   renovating   our   bathrooms ,   we   added   an   amenity   i   so   appreciate   in   hotels .   convenience   to   our   over   nighters ,   and   in   baggage   weight ,   are   both   a   plus   to   them   as   well .   the   night   light   is   great   for   the   grandbabies   also .   amazon   s   cumulative   point   system   and   free   shipping   cannot   be   beat .

great   product !   i   read   about   the   john   frieda   full   volume   hair   dryer   in   a   magazine ,   and   it   has   more   than   lived   up   to   its   review .   dries   quickly ,   leaves   hair   soft ,   with   no   frizzies ,   and   with   lots   of   body .   it   s   made   my   wavy ,   mind   of   its   own   hair   behave   for   the   first   time .   i   highly   recommend   this   product .   couldn   t   live   without   it .
it   a   good   bigger   dryer .   my   wife   needed   a   new   dryer   and   bought   this   because   of   the   reviews .   its   on   the   bigger   size   compare   to   the   smaller   dryers   which   we   normally   use .   but   its   a   slightly   quieter   as   it   does   not   struggle   for   air .   the   handle   do   fold   to   help   with   storing   it   everyday .   over   all ,   we   like   it   and   hope   that   it   last   longer   than   other   conairs   which   we   used   before .
best   hair   dryer   i   ever   owned   lots   of   power   behind   the   air ,   cool   shot   button   and   cool   setting ,   which   i   love   because   my   old   one   only   had   the   shot   button   which   made   me   have   to   keep   it   held   in   entire   time   if   i   wanted   cool   air .......
awesome !   got   this   for   my   wife   she   loves   it .   did   my   research   on   which   hair   dryer   to   get   and   the   power   on   this   one   is   incredible .   still   noisy   all   hair   dryers   are   ,   but   less   so   then   some   of   the   previous   high   end   ones   she   has   used .
extemely   noisy   after   reading   positive   reviews ,   i   orderd   this   hairdyer .   i   had   a   braun   hairdryer   that   worked   like   a   charm   for   almost   a   decade   which   now   needs   replacement .   i   dont   want   an   ionic   hair   dryer   since   it   leaves   my   thick   hair   flat .   i   was   disappointed   as   soon   as   i   took   this   out   of   the   box ,   it   s   heavier   than   the   braun   i   had   too   bad   they   dont   sell   any   hair   dryers   in   the   us   anymore   and   the   shape   was   kind   of   long .   when   i   turned   it   on ,   i   found   the   dryer   even   in   the   lowest   setting   to   be   deafeningly   loud   and   the   air   speed   wasn   t   very   good .   you   have   to   put   it   on   medium   of   high   to   even   get   the   temperature   to   be   very   warm   but   the   noise   was   unbearably   loud   for   me .   i   m   hoping   i   havea   defective   dryer   and   i   m   looking   forward   to   trying   the   replacement   amazon   agreed   to   send   me .
definitely   reccomend   i   love   this   blow   dryer ,   i   bought   it   because   it   s   the   one   that   the   lady   at   the   salon   uses .   it   gets   really   hot   fast   and   it   has   four   heat   settings   low   cold ,   high   cold ,   low   hot ,   high   hot   .   i   use   it   with   a   round   bristle   brush   and   it   staightens   my   thick   curly   hair   in   less   than   half   an   hour   and   leaves   lots   of   volume .   you   won   t   regret   buying   it .
andis   micro   turbo   hair   dryer   this   hair   dryer   is   the   best .   it   is   light   weight   and   has   two   powerful   heat   levels .   i   first   used   this   hair   dryer   in   a   marriott   hotel .   i   loved   it   so   much   that   i   wrote   down   the   name ,   so   i   could   order   one   for   myself .   so   happy   i   did .   asin   b001ue7d32   andis   30095   micro   turbo   1200   watt   hair   dryer  
great   hair   dryer   got   this   hair   dryer   after   my   hot   tools   pink   zebra   one   broke .   while   it   s   not   as   cute   it   does   dry   my   hair   better .   i   am   loving   how   light   weight   it   is ,   i   have   long   hair   and   sometimes   my   arm   gets   tired   from   being   up   in   the   air   that   long .   but   this   blow   dryer   is   very   light   weight   and   packs   a   punch   too !   it   dries   my   hair   pretty   fast   and   cuts   out   some   of   the   frizz   with   the   ions .   overall   i   love   it !
andis   30975   hd   10l   1600w   quiet   hangup   hair   dryer   with   night   light   i   love   this   hairdryer ,   perfect   size   the   night   light   is   perfect   in   the   bathroom .   this   is   the   second   one   i   purchased .
do   not   buy ! ! ! !   a   few   months   after   purchasing ,   the   high   setting   became   low   and   the   dryer   began   shooting   sparks   out   of   it .   this   dryer   is   a   fire   hazard   and   does   not   function   properly .   purchase   at   your   own   risk .
great   dryer !   i   love   this   dryer ... it   really   does   take   away   the   frizzies .   i   d   give   it   5   stars   but   it   is   a   bit   heavy   and   the   cord   is   super   long .
blows   u   away   impressed   with   this   item .   dries   hair   fast .   feels   like   a   gentler   version   for   hair   of   those   turbo   hand   dryers   u   can   find   in   bathrooms   that   feel   like   they   ll   blow   ur   skin   off .   only   reason   i   d   give   4   5   star   is   b   c   the   loose   cord   gets   kinda   annoying   when   putting   it   away .
best   one   i   found   this   is   really   worth   for   me . i   ll   definitely   prefer   this   drier   to   everyone .   it   dries   hair   just   within   5min .
wouldn   t   recommend   i   bought   this   dryer   in   a   rush   at   target   and   have   regretted   it   ever   since .   my   main   issue   with   the   design   are   the   buttons .   they   are   meant   to   be   slid   into   position   but   i   usually   cannot   get   it   to   budge   and   have   to   try   to   force   it   my   thumb   nail ,   which   isn   t   very   pleasant .   br   br   it   s   also   very   loud   and   it   constantly   makes   a   popping   crackling   what   have   you   noise   like   it   may   explode   any   moment .
i   love   my   new   hair   dryer !   dryer   is   super   quiet   at   least   compared   to   my   old   one .   hair   dries   fast   and   soft .   i   love   the   adjustable   heat   and   the   cold   shot   to   set   my   hair .   probably   if   i   could   change   anything ,   i   would   make   it   have   a   retractable   cord   and   the   buttons   are   a   little   awkward ,   but   it   runs   great   and   dries   my   hair   quickly   and   doesn   t   fry   it !
thanks   for   still   carrying   this   type   of   dryer   i   am   grateful   to   still   be   able   to   find   this   type   of   dryer .   they   are   very   hard ,   impossible ,   to   find   in   a   store   on   the   shelf .   so   thanks   for   letting   us   count   on   you   to   find   items   for   us .
powerful ,   and   retractable   cord   a   plus !   i   used   this   dryer   for   four   days   while   staying   at   a   hyatt   hotel .   i   was   immediately   impressed   by   how   powerfully   and   quickly   it   dried   my   hair .   the   retractable   cord   was   an   instant   hit   with   me   as   well   the   cord   on   my   current   dryer   is   presently   tangled   up   all   over   my   bathroom   sink .   br   br   it   is   a   bit   heavy   and   bulky   i   wasn   t   aware   that   it   folded   .   br   br   i   wasn   t   in   the   market   for   a   dryer ,   but   i   liked   this   one   enough   after   my   hotel   test   drive   that   i   will   be   purchasing   one   immediately !   br   br   update   nov   2012   so ,   i   ve   used   this   daily   for   a   year .   a   good   dryer ,   i   must   admit   i   don   t   find   anything   particularly   different   about   this   ionic   dryer   as   compared   to   other   dryers   e . g . ,   i   can   t   say   my   hair   is   shinier   or   more   manageable   .   still ,   a   good ,   but   heavy ,   dryer .   i   m   still   enjoying   that   retractable   cord !
awesome   hairdryer   i   have   heard   about   how   great   tourmaline   hairdryers   are   for   years ,   but   had   never   tried   one .   i   m   a   total   convert   at   this   point   the   t3   dries   my   curly   hair   straight   and   shiny ,   and   it   weighs   practically   nothing .   it   s   a   quiet   yet   very   powerful   little   machine .
hang   up   hair   dryer   we   have   had   walll   mount   hair   dryers   in   our   bathroom   for   over   20   years .   they   work   great   and   last   a   long   time .   the   new   andis   meets   my   expectations   for   power   and   convenience ,   takes   up   very   little   space   and   is   always   easily   stored .   every   family   needs   one !   br   br   3   30   3013   i   wish   to   change   my   review   after   using   this   product !   i   bought   2   of   these   dryers   in   sept   2011 .   one   was   replaced   under   warranty   after   6   months .   both   of   them   have   now   quit   one   was   used   for   18   months ,   the   other   for   1   year   .   in   both   cases   the   dryer   was   being   used   at   low   speed   when   it   sudddenly   smelled   hot   and   switched   to   high   speed .   the   low   speed   switch   apparently   burned   out .   i   am   not   sure   they   are   really   safe   to   use   after   the   burn   smell .   i   also   do   not   like   the   high   speed   for   drying   my   hair !   my   previous   wall   mount   dryers   both   a   different   brand   lasted   over   10   years   each .   i   feel   this   product   quality   is   not   good   considering   the   short   life   of   the   product .   these   dryers   were   used   only   about   twice   a   week .   my   dryers   in   the   past   were   used   daily   and   by   a   large   family ,   so   these   andis   ones   definitely   did   not   last   well .
good   power   but   gets   hot   this   is   the   second   version   of   this   dryer   ive   had .   almost   exactly   the   same   setup   as   the   first .   great   power   as   usual .   i   have   a   lot   of   hair   so   power   is   essential   to   speed   up   my   morning   routine .   my   only   complaint ,   just   like   the   model   before ,   is   that   the   hot   air   comes   out   of   the   separation   between   the   buttons   and   the   frame   and   can   bother   my   hands .   it   s   manageable ,   and   again   i   ll   take   it   because   of   the   power .   the   other   thing   i   should   mention   is   that   i   had   the   first   version   for   over   3   years   before   the   motor   finally   gave   in .   so   good   purchase   as   it   lasted   a   while .
good   but   didn   t   last   long   i   ll   be   honest ,   when   i   spent   over   100   on   a   hairdryer ,   i   expected   a   lot .   br   br   this   hairdryer   did   a   great   job ,   for   about   a   year   and   a   half .   it   was   used   every   day   for   a   year   and   a   half .   br   br   pluses   low ,   medium ,   high   heat   br   cold   blast   to   set   hair   br   low   and   medium   setting   br   br   the   cord   is   a   huge   problem .   it   twists   and   tangles   to   the   point   of   shorting   out .   had   to   replace   the   plug .
compact   hair   dryer   hair   dryer   was   very   easy   to   install   and   looks   nice   on   the   wall .   the   design   of   base   and   cord   holder   keeps   everything   in   its   place .   the   night   light   is   sufficently   bright   for   late   nite   visits   to   the   john .   the   dryer   works   sufficently   and   as   expected .
don   t   get   it   for   the   night   light   i   purchased   two   of   these   one   white   and   one   black   and   the   night   lights   they   have   are   plenty   bright   and   look   very   nice .   the   problem   is   that   they   don   t   last .   the   night   light   in   the   white   one   went   out   on   the   second   day .   the   night   light   in   the   black   one   went   out   on   the   third   day .   after   i   drilled   the   holes   to   mount   them ,   i   didn   t   really   want   to   bother   with   the   hassle   to   return   them   since   the   hair   dryers   both   work   fine .   i   m   pretty   sure   i   saw   a   cheaper   version   of   these   without   the   night   light ,   and   that   s   what   i   d   recommend .   i   m   used   to   a   bit   more   wind   from   my   regular   dryer   at   three   times   the   size   but   these   dryers   still   complete   the   job   in   about   the   same   amount   of   time .   the   ones   i   received   do   have   the   coiled   cord ,   exactly   like   the   picture   some   say   they   received   straight   cords   and   it   turns   off   automatically   when   you   return   the   dryer   to   the   holder .   my   only   complaints   are   the   night   lights   going   out   of   course   and   the   fact   that   you   can   t   remove   the   dryer   from   the   holder   to   pack   in   a   suitcase ,   which   is   a   shame   because   they   are   very   small   and   would   be   great   for   travel   if   you   could .   all   in   all   i   m   happy   with   the   purchase .
andis   40055   pro   style   1600   hair   dryer   the   hair   dryer   runs   a   little   hotter   than   i   wanted .   otherwise   it   is   a   good   dryer   for   those   who   want   a   less   powerful   hair   dryer .

hair   dryer   this   is   a   great   dryer ,   but   its   a   little   too   heavy .   it   dries   very   quickly   and   does   not   harm   hair .
don   t   buy   worked   less   than   one   year   i   really   enjoyed   getting   my   hairdryer   off   the   countertop ,   but   i   ll   have   to   do   it   with   a   different   brand   in   the   future .   i   purchased   this   unit   9   months   ago .   a   few   days   ago ,   the   switch   stopped   working   for   medium   and   high   settings .   i   sent   a   note   to   the   company   via   their   website   asking   for   assistance   and   haven   t   heard   back   from   them .   i   m   sure   they   ll   replace   it   under   warranty ,   but   why   would   i   spend   10   in   shipping   for   a   20   product   to   get   what   would   probably   be   a   refurbished   model   i   suggest   you   look   at   other   options ,   which   is   what   i   m   going   to   do   now .
buyer   beware   not   an   authorized   t3   reseller   i   purchased   a   hairdryer   for   over   100   from   this   vendor   in   jan   2009 .   i   filled   out   all   the   warranty   forms   and   submitted   to   t3   as   expected .   now   it   s   october   of   2011   and   it   is   already   breaking .   i   was   sold   a   pos !   so   when   i   contacted   the   manufacturer   about   the   dryer   no   longer   functioning   properly ,   they   responded   via   email   that   this   vendor   and   amazon . com   are   not   an   authorized   resellers   of   t3   products   and   my   dryer   is   not   covered   under   the   warranty .   now   i   am   royally   hosed .   i   highly   suggest   not   purchasing   any   products   that   may   require   a   warranty   fix   from   any   vendor   like   this .
i   really   enjoyed   it ! ! ! !   i   really   enjoyed   this   product .   i   have   thick   hair   and   overall   it   dried   it   quicker   than   any   other   blow   dryer   i   ever   had .   i   received   it   on   time   and   just   as   shown   in   the   picture   thats   how   i   got   my   product .
just   like   a   hotel   suite !   i   attached   this   great   dryer   to   my   wall   in   the   master   bathroom .   it   is   secure   and   so   nice   not   to   have   to   dig   the   dryer   out   of   a   drawer   or   from   under   the   sink .   it   looks   fantastic   and   works   perfectly .
broke   after   1   month !   i   thought   this   blow   dryer   worked   great   and   i   wish   i   could   give   it   more   stars .   i   was   using   it   today   and   the   power   switch   broke .   it   s   completely   broken   and   now   i   have   to   throw   the   whole   thing   away .   what   a   waste   of   money !
can   i   give   a   zero   rating   this   rating   is   not   for   the   item   itself ,   coz   it   never   worked .   i   had   been   shopping   with   amazon   for   about   3.5   yrs   and   never   had   one   instance   of   a   bad   experience .   after   a   lot   of   research ,   i   nailed   to   buy   this   item .   i   was   excited   to   see   that   it   would   get   delivered   in   2   days .   i   was   eagerly   waiting   for   it .   an   unknown   carrier   called   ensenda   was   chosen   to   deliver   this   to   me .   they   took   their   own   sweet   3   days   after   much   of   follow   ups   from   me   to   deliver   the   item .   with   much   expectation ,   i   opened   the   item   just   to   find   out   it   would   not   work .   i   was   doubting   my   own   mental   caliber   to   operate   such   a   simple   instrument ,   tried   out   different   options ,   nothing   would   work .   i   took   the   drier   to   4   different   power   points   in   the   house ,   no   luck .   to   make   sure   that   i   m   not   doing   a   mistake ,   i   asked   my   roomie   to   check   if   it   would   work ,   no   luck .   the   first   thing   i   did   next   day   morning   was   to   ship   this   back   to   amazon   and   got   a   conair   ion   shine   ceramic   1875 .   also ,   buyers   please   dont   get   carried   away   by   its   glossy   looks ,   it   looks   stylish   in   the   image ,   but   looks   cheap   in   reality .   the   control   buttons   are   also   bad .   i   m   very   happy   with   my   conair ,   it   looks   pretty   sophisticated   with   beautiful   controls   for   just   13.28   dollars   tax .   thanks   to   amazon   that   it   forced   me   out   of   a   pathetic   choice .   i   love   amazon   as   always ! !
larger   than   i   thought   guess   i   should   condier   myself   lucky ,   at   least   mine   is   working   ...   so   far   anyway !   a   lot   bigger   than   i   had   hoped   it   would   be .   high   speed   has   lots   of   volume ,   but   doesn   t   seem   as   forceful   as   my   last   hair   dryer .   guess   some   things   require   a   visit   to   a   real   store .   otherwise ,   it   s   okay .   just   hope   it   stays   working .

don   t   waste   your   this   dryer   was   purchased   in   august   2010   and   the   contriol   button   became   stuck   in   october2011   and   the   company   won   t   fix   or   replace .   this   dryer   is   a   piece   of   junk   and   should   have   lasted   for   a   couple   years   at   least .   called   company   and   got   no   help   at   all .   will   not   buy   jerdon   products   again .
great   settings ,   light ,   easy   to   use ,   reliable   really   comfortable   to   use   because   it   is   lightweight .   the   settings   are   great   3   speed   and   3   temperature   settings   .   love   that   they   are   slide   buttons   not   push   buttons   to   avoid   accidental   presses .   heats   up   your   hair ,   not   your   hand .   only   thing   i   wish   was   that   the   wire   was   longer   it   s   plugged   into   a   knee   height   socket   and   it   s   just   about   long   enough   for   me   to   stand   in   front   of   it   and   dry   my   hair   without   moving   from   the   spot .
quiet   and   efficient   wall   mounted   hair   dryers   in   hotels   are   so   convenient .   i   had   tried   to   find   one   to   buy   in   regular   stores   but   never   found   one .   looked   online   and   selected   this   one   because   the   ad   said   this   andis   was   quiet .   it   really   is   much   quieter   than   all   other   hand   helds   i   ve   used .   i   have   very   thick   hair ,   and   this   dryer   does   the   job   easily .   happy   to   recommend   this   dryer .
great   hair   dryer   this   product   is   great .   very   powerful   and   incredibly   silent   for   all   the   air   that   it   blows .   works   great   and   i   can   dry   my   hair   right   after   the   shower ,   no   need   to   wait   anymore .   highly   recommended .
do   not   purchase   this   item   i   purchased   this   item   a   few   months   ago   because   i   wanted   a   soft   bonnet   dryer   to   replace   my   old   dryer .   the   price   seemed   reasonable .   i   did   not   have   the   problems   several   other   customers   experienced   with   the   dryer   stopping   and   then   restarting .   at   least   their   s   restarted .   my   unit   just   died   on   me   while   drying   my   hair .   i   was   never   able   to   get   it   restarted .   i   had   owned   the   unit   for   only   a   few   months   so   i   did   not   think   amazon   would   accept   a   late   return .   the   storing   of   the   tubing ,   bonnet   and   cord   was   very   difficult   with   each   use .   the   space   was   too   small   to   accomodate   everything .   the   medium   setting   tended   to   be   very   hot .   i   wish   i   had   read   the   other   reviews   prior   to   purchasing .   i   am   now   stuck   without   a   hair   dryer   at   home .   this   item   was   a   complete   waste   of   money .   please   do   not   purchase   this   item .
great   dryer !   i   received   this   hair   dryer   a   while   back   and   it   works   wonderfully !   i   used   to   just   let   my   hair   air   dry   because   most   dryers   just   take   too   long .   this   one   dries   quickly   and   i   love   the   multiple   settings .

died   after   less   than   a   month   this   hairdryer   is   lightweight ,   powerful   and   quiet   as   promised ,   however   it   completely   died   after   less   than   a   month .   it   seems   like   other   reviewers   had   similar   experiences .   therefore   i   would   not   recommend   the   product .
overheating   problem   this   is   the   second   revlon   hair   dryer   i   ve   purchased   in   the   last   four   years   and   both   times   it   had   the   same   problem   overheating   where   the   cord   enters   the   handle .   this   one   lasted   a   month .   the   previous   one   a   forty   dollar   item   lasted   two   months   and   almost   caused   a   fire   while   i   was   using   it .   i   do   not   recommend   revlon   hair   dryers   and   will   not   purchase   one   again .   added   on   oct   13 ,   2011   well ,   once   it   started   showing   overheating   problems   that   i   recognized   from   previous   revlon   dryer ,   i   went   ahead   and   ordered   an   andis   1600   watt   which   is   also   a   very   low   price   but   pretty   strong   hair   dryer .   my   previous   andis   worked   for   several   years   with   no   problem   and   i   loved   it   before   it   conked   out   on   me   and   i   would   have   ordered   another   but   it   was   out   of   stock   at   the   time ,   so   i   ordered   the   revlon   instead .   sigh .   so ,   one   month   later   i   am   tossing   the   revlon   and   fortunately   the   andis   is   back   in   stock   now   and   arrived   two   days   before   my   revlon   popped   loudly   and   frizzled   and   fried   and   died   an   ignominious   death   this   evening .   so   i   had   a   back   up   in   place .   thank   you   andis !   i   will   not   be   buying   anything   but   andis   hair   dryers   from   now   on .   the   revlon   is   not   worth   buying   imo .

noisy   but   alright   does   what   it   s   supposed   to ,   love   the   retractable   cord ,   i   dont   really   care   about   the   color ,   inexpensive ,   but   really   loud .   oh   well ,   can   t   have   it   all   in   life .   overall ,   it   s   a   good   product .
well   done   john   frieda !   i   got   this   dryer   for   my   wife   as   she   has   fine ,   relatively   delicate   hair   and   every   dryer   she   has   ever   used   has   made   it   dry   and   harder   to   manage   in   the   past   i   heard   many   complaints   .   did   this   dryer   fare   any   better   well   she   hasn   t   had   that   problem   with   this   dyer ,   and   to   me   that   s   saying   a   lot .   br   br   john   frieda   is   a   salon   product   label   not   an   appliance   manufacturer ,   but   they   seem   to   have   chosen   quite   well   the   bathroom   appliance   to   put   their   name   on .   it   s   well   designed ,   attractive ,   and   most   importantly   well   built   and   effective   as   what   it   s   designed   to   be   used   for .   as   my   wife   is   the   hair   care   expert   i   relied   on   her   expert   experience   with   this   device   for   the   bulk   of   the   info   for   this   review .   but   for   the   record ,   here   s   my   two   cents   her   hair   looks   less   damaged ,   smoother   and   softer ,   has   less   split   ends ,   and   in   general   looks   healthier   with   use   of   this   device .   the   only   downside   i   can   see   is   that   it   is   a   bit   large .   now   on   to   her   opinions ...   br   the   number   one   thing   my   wife   said   she   likes   about   the   dryer   is   the   ample   number   of   heat   and   speed   settings .   these   allow   you   to   customize   the   dryer   to   your   specific   hair   texture   in   order   to   dry   your   hair   as   quickly   as   possible ,   with   the   least   damage   done .   it   also   has   a   cold   shot   button ,   a   feature   she   would   like   better   if   it   had   a   lock .   it   gets   tiring   trying   to   hold   the   button   continually .   br   br   she   also   likes   that   it   comes   with   three   attachments   a   diffuser   and   two   concentrators   .   these   are   made   of   sturdy   plastic ,   and   are   very   easy   to   snap   on   and   off   the   nozzle .   however ,   they   do   heat   up   very   quickly   during   use   so   switching   between   them   while   blow   drying   can   be   a   little   uncomfortable .   the   device   also   has   a   nice   long   power   cord   which   is   convenient .   br   the   only   really   con   with   this   dryer   would   be   its   size .   we   have   very   limited   storage   space   in   my   bathroom   and   this   dryer   takes   up   a   lot   of   space .   however ,   considering   everything   else   this   dryer   has   to   offer   it   s   not   a   deal   breaker   in   the   least .   i   would   recommend   this   dryer   to   anyone   looking   for   a   fast   and   effective   dryer ,   that   won   t   cause   a   lot   of   damage   to   your   hair ,   even   with   daily   use   .   especially   recommended   to   people   with   fine   or   delicate   hair .   it   s   an   excellent   value   for   a   great   price .   well   done   john   frieda ! and   effective   dryer ,   that   won   t   cause   a   lot   of   damage   to   your   hair ,   even   with   daily   use   .   especially   recommended   to   people   with   fine   or   delicate   hair .   it   s   an   excellent   value   for   a   great   price .   well   done   john   frieda !
great   product ,   great   price .   this   is   my   second   hair   blower   of   the   exact   same   model .   conair   ionic   conditioning   pro   style   1875   watt   hair   dryer   asin   b00005o0mz   conair   ionic   conditioning   pro   style   1875   watt   hair   dryer   i   would   by   it   again .
conair   pink   hair   dryer   totally   worth   20   i   ordered   my   hair   dryer   for   one   day   shipping   i   received   have   used   it   and   give   it   5   stars ...   it   works   fine .. no   issues .. i   have   small   hands   and   this   is   lightweight   enough   it   doesnt   tire   my   hands ...   took   like   5   minutes   to   dry   my   hair   and   it   is   thick   and   holds   water ...   for   20   this   is   perfect !
hair   dryer   the   hair   dryer   it   is   an   excelen   product ,   it   works   properly ,   so   far   so   good   i   recommend   the   andis   82005 .
dries   your   hair   in   about   2   minutes   i   first   tried   this   dryer   at   a   time   share .   i   was   so   impressed   with   how   fast   it   dried   my   hair   that   i   bought   one   and   mounted   it   on   the   wall   in   my   bathroom   at   home .   now   it   s   always   handy   to   grab ,   and   it   doubles   as   a   night   light .   it   just   plugs   in   no   wiring   involved .   this   is   my   second   purchase   it   was   a   birthday   gift   for   a   girlfriend .   she   is   equally   delighted   by   this   dryer   s   speed .
love   this   dryer !   i   am   so   glad   my   other   dryer   bit   the   dust !   this   dryer   is   the   nicest   one   i   have   ever   owned ,   it   dries   my   hair   quickly   without   blowing   like   a   tornado   and   my   hair   is   a   whole   lot   less   frizzy !
as   expected   exactly   as   described .   powerful   dryer .   only   used   it   two   days   so   far ,   but   seems   to   have   cut   my   drying   time .   lighter   weight   than   my   old   one .   overall   would   recommend .
fast   dryer   this   hair   dryer   lives   up   to   the   hype   that   it   is   faster   than   other   dryers .   and   it   is   very   quiet   if   that   is   important   to   you .   overall   i   like   it .
not   the   quality   i   expected   my   wife   has   had   conair   hair   dryers   in   the   past   that   have   lasted   many   years .   old   one   finally   died .   wanted   the   same   pistol   grip   style   so   bought   the   blackbird   pro ,   thinking   it   would   last   even   longer .   this   one   only   lasted   19   months   before   the   bearings   went   out   and   i   am   told   by   conair   it   only   has   a   12   month   warranty .   paid   30   for   it ,   but   was   able   to   buy   a   different   cheaper   model   at   walmart   for   17   with   a   24   month   warranty .   go   figure .
lasted   barely   a   year   the   hair   dryer   was   great   at   first ,   but   just   after   i   had   it   for   a   year   it   broke   and   would   only   blow   cold   air .   not   worth   the   money ...
great   i   love   this .   i   ve   had   it   about   6   months   now   and   it   works   very   well .   i   like   that   the   filter   easily   comes   out   and   i   just   really   love   the   pink .   good   product .
happy   customer   the   fhi   nano   salon   pro   2000   hair   dryer   onyx   black   was   shipped   soon   after   i   ordered   it .   i   am   a   happy   customer .   i   will   never   buy   anything   less   that   than   2000   watt   again .   it   does   not   dry   out   my   hair .   it   is   very   powerful   though   so   make   sure   you   use   mocorran   oil   or   at   least   a   comparable   oil   to   mosturize   your   hair .
great   hair   dryer   this   is   a   great   hair   dryer   and   would   highly   recommend   it !   we   already   had   one   family   member   with   this   dryer   and   liked   it   so   much   we   got   a   second   one .
not   good   for   my   curly   hair   i   ve   been   using   this   dryer   for   about   3   weeks   now   and   the   airflow   on   the   lowest   settings   is   too   strong .   even   with   the   diffuser   on ,   my   hair   frizzes   every   time .   it   doesn   t   dry   my   hair   as   fast   as   i   expected   it   to   either .   i   also   don   t   really   like   that   the   controls   are   on   the   back   of   the   handle .   i   end   up   changing   the   settings   without   knowing   it .   i   was   using   a   t3   tourmaline   dryer   and   loved   it ,   but   i   thought   i   d   try   something   different   this   time .   i   ll   be   going   back   to   the   t3   because   it   s   better   in   every   way .   i   m   giving   the   fhi   to   my   niece   who   straightens   her   hair .   i   m   sure   it   would   be   great   for   her .
it   works   the   item   was   black   and   white   rather   than   black   and   silver .   otherwise   it   works   and   includes   all   the   attachments .   nothing   else   i   can   think   of ...
amazonshopper   this   blow   dryer   doesn   t   have   a   cord   retieval   like   ohter   andis   dryers   do .   the   cord   is   thin   and   very   long .   for   storage   after   daily   use   i   wrap   the   cord   around   the   dryer   or   handle   part .   after   only   a   few   weeks   i   ve   noticed   that   the   cord   is   becoming   kinked .   it   s   only   a   matter   or   time   before   it   s   shorting   out .
great   blow   dryer   my   favorite   blow   dryer   finally   died ,   so   i   was   forced   to   buy   a   new   one .   i   am   so   glad   i   did .   this   blow   dryer   dries   my   super   thick ,   long   hair   way   faster   than   any   other   blow   dryer .   and   i   think   it   looks   shinier   and   straighter   too .   the   pink   color   is   pretty ,   and   makes   it   easy   to   find   in   my   pile   of   hair   instruments .   the   retractable   cord   is   so   nice ,   it   doesn   t   get   tangled   in   with   my   3   curling   irons   and   flat   iron .   i   wish   they   had   the   retractable   cord   too !   .   and   the   cord   doesn   t   retract   too   fast   and   hit   you   in   the   hand .   great ,   salon   quality   blow   dryer   for   a   fraction   of   the   cost .

hand   grip   gets   too   hot   the   hand   grip   gets   too   hot   to   hold   after   about   2   minutes .   not   like   toasty   warm   hot !   it   is   heavy   and   the   buttons   are   located   in   a   bad   spot .   don   t   bother .

nice   hair   dryer !   i   love   this   hair   dryer !   i   live   in   a   college   dorm   and   share   this   dryer   with   my   roommate   and   it   s   working   perfectly !
powerful   the   design   is   simple   and   nothing   special   but   it   is   damn   powerful   and   works   great .   that   is   all   you   need   from   a   blow   dryer ! !
ergonomic   basic   hairdryer   with   a   hard   working   motor   first   of   all ,   while   conair   may   want   you   to   think   that   this   infinitpro   hairdryer   is   travel   oriented   by   designing   the   handle   to   neatly   fold   and   also   including   a   tote ,   this   hairdryer   is   actually   quite   bulky   in   size   and   not   exactly   lightweight .   having   said   that ,   there   is   nothing   to   dislike   about   it   once   you   are   settled   on   using   it   at   home .   at   1875   watt ,   this   packs   enough   power   that   matches   most   current   hairdryers .   it   has   two   heat   settings   high   and   low ,   and   there   is   a   button   that   turns   off   the   heating   element   so   that   cool   air   continues   to   blow .   the   motor   seems   hard   working   enough   that   i   have   never   experienced   any   overheating   issues .   now   i   understand   that   there   is   some   claim   about   certain   ceramic   and   ion   technology   that   should   give   a   smoother   hair .   perhaps   it   s   my   hair ,   but   in   practice ,   i   don   t   notice   any   difference   from   my   existing   hairdryer   i   bought   several   years   back   from   a   brand   starting   v   s .   overall ,   i   think   this   is   a   solid   hairdryer   that   does   the   job   just   fine .   however ,   don   t   expect   any   novelty .
my   wife   loves   it .   i   got   this   dryer   and   immediately   turned   it   over   to   my   wife .   she   uses   a   hair   drier   frequently   and   have   seen   her   with   frizzy   hair   from   it   at   times .   i   figured   this   would   be   a   perfect   test .   br   br   the   dryer   has   a   balanced   feel   to   it   and   isn   t   too   heavy .   the   body   is   made   of   plastic   that   feels   solid .   if   you   squeeze   it   will   creak   and   crack   but   it   still   feels   solid .   the   intake   and   output   screens   are   metal   and   should   hold   up   well .   it   has   a   very   nice   cable   stress   relief   on   the   dryer   side   that   looks   like   it   will   help   with   and   last   through   all   the   waving   around   that   is   sure   to   come .   the   plug   side   has   a   nice   and   compact   gfi   built   into   it   so   you   are   less   likely   to   die   from   using   it .   size   wise   i   think   this   is   a   stay   at   home   dryer .   i   would   look   for   something   a   bit   more   compact   for   travel   if   you   need   one .   br   br   the   side   of   the   handle   contains   two   switches .   one   for   temperature   cool ,   warm ,   and   hot   one   for   speed   off ,   low ,   and   high   .   there   is   a   momentary   switch   on   the   handle   in   the   trigger   position   for   the   cool   shot   function .   br   br   after   turning   her   loose   with   this   for   a   few   weeks   my   wife   says   her   hair   definitely   is   less   frizzy   and   feels   softer   after   using   this   dryer   versus   her   other   dryer .   i   can   confirm   this   as   well ,   it   feels   softer   to   me   and   i   notice   it   is   less   frizzy .   br   br   i   m   sold   on   it   after   seeing   what   it   does   and   as   with   anything   your   mileage   may   vary   but   it   works   well   for   my   wife   and   she   wouldn   t   hesitate   to   recommend   this   dryer   to   her   friends .
worked   for   3   months !   this   is   the   third   andis   hang   up   dryer   i   ve   had .   the   first   two   were   great   worked   for   years .   i   bought   this   one   on   june   10 ,   2011 .   it   lasted   until   september   8 ,   2011 .   it   s   too   late   to   return   it   now   of   course .   so   i   m   out   the   money   and   out   of   a   hair   dryer .   very   disappointed !
not   durable   it   was   very   nice   when   it   was   working ,   small ,   powerful ,   folds   in   half ,   cord   retracts ,   etc .   after   8   months ,   it   made   loud   sounds   and   burning   smell .   i   dis   assambled   the   dyer   and   found   a   small   internal   plastic   piece   broke   and   got   into   heating   element .   my   other   dryers   lasted   much   longer   than   this   one .   i   m   not   buying   this   model   ever   again .
loud   cord   gets   stuck   does   not   retract   all   the   way   i   m   actually   going   to   return   this   hair   dryer .   it   s   unfortunate   and   i   m   giving   it   3   stars   because   it   dries   my   hair   well   and   my   hair   seems   less   frizzy   than   with   other   dryers   ,   but   it   is   simply   too   loud   i   feel   like   using   it   too   much   will   damage   my   hearing   ,   and   the   cord   keeps   getting   stuck   even   when   i   try   to   help   push   it   into   the   unit   ,   which   is   frustrating .   overall ,   i   m   bummed   that   this   one   didn   t   work   out ...
t3   review   the   dryer   works   ok   nothing   special   but   there   was   no   registration   card   in   the   box   so   i   called   the   manufacturer .   they   said   the   warranty   is   void   since   amazon   is   not   an   authorized   dealer .   i   would   like   to   have   known   that .   so   far   as   i   know   what   i   received   is   a   knock   off   of   the   real   thing .   in   addition   there   was   no   receipt   in   the   box .
travel   dryer   this   is   absolutely   fabulous !   very   lightweight   and   compact   when   it   folds .   perfect   for   travel .   cheaper   than   the   retail   stores .   great   product   for   the   money ... an   awesome   color   too !
got   a   lemon   ordered   this   dryer   about   a   year   ago   from   another   site .   was   my   first   time   buying   a   professional   dryer   had   used   drug   store   brands   before   .   the   dryer   is   great   high   heat   setting ,   powerful ,   cuts   drying   time   by   about   30   ,   leaves   hair   super   shiny   and   soft ,   and   i   noticed   that   hair   stayed   that   way   for   longer .   it   s   a   bit   on   the   heavy   side ,   and   doesn   t   have   that   grip   coating   that   some   of   the   other   brands   have .   i   give   it   one   star   because   i   was   using   it   two   weeks   ago   and   it   caught   on   fire .   thick   gray   smoke   with   a   burnt   plastic   smell .   i   contacted   customer   service   through   their   website   but   they   didn   t   respond   at   all .   i   don   t   think   it   s   designed   to   handle   the   heat   it   puts   out .   nevertheless ,   i   m   out   a   pretty   expensive   professional   dryer   that   only   lasted   a   year .   will   not   buy   this   one   again ,   but   will   look   for   one   that   s   comparable .
hate   hate   hate !   this   is   probably   the   worst   hairdryer   i   have   purchased   in   my   31   years   of   living .   it   is   super   heavy   and   doesn   t   even   blow   hot   air .   i   would   not   recommend   and   am   super   sad   because   i   threw   the   box   away   and   cannot   return   it .   based   on   all   the   positive   reviews ,   i   thought   i   would   love   it ,   but   i   was   very   wrong .
great   hair   dryer !   this   is   my   second   of   this   particular   hair   dryer .   but   the   first   one   lasted   10   years   which   is   amazing .   since   i   couldn   t   be   without   a   hairdryer ,   i   bought   another   one .   however ,   i   sent   in   the   old   one   to   elchim   for   repair .   on   their   website   it   said   the   repair   was   20 .   that   was   correct   and   for   20   i   now   have   a   2nd   hairdryer   ...   not   that   i   need   it   since   this   product   lives   up   to   the   hype .   this   is   the   hairdryer   my   hairdresser   uses   and   swears   by .   i   highly   recommend   the   elchim   professional   2001   1800   watt   classic   hair   dryer !
love   it   great   blow   dryer !   it   takes   half   the   time   to   blow   dry   my   hair   like   my   old   one   did   and   takes   a   lot   of   the   frizz   off   too .   i   love   this   blow   dryer .   highly   recommend   it .   shipped   fast ! !
doesnt   last   this   is   the   second   jerdon   i   purchased   mainly   because   i   wanted   to   keep   the   same   holes   in   the   wall .   i   won   t   buy   another   one .   i   think   the   first   one   lasted   2   years   and   this   one   just   died   after   2   years .   thats   crazy .   yes   i   use   it   everyday   but   i   still   have   my   hair   dryer   from   college   that   works   beautifully   although   a   bit   bulky   and   its   30   years   old .   this   hair   dryer   lasted   2   years ! !   thats   ridiculous .
i   would   have   said   it   was   great .... except ...   this   was   a   great   hair   dryer   for   a   couple   of   months .   i   received   the   dryer   in   may   and   used   it   regularly   for   several   months .   in   august   i   noticed   that   it   just   didn   t   feel   hot   any   more .   i   pushed   all   the   switches   and   button   up   and   down ,   in   and   out   several   times   to   see   if   something   was   stuck   but   no   luck ,   it   just   stopped   blowing   hot   air .   i   immediately   contacted   andis   via   email   and   asked   what   i   should   do   about   the   malfunctioning   dryer   but   as   of   now ,   3   weeks   later ,   no   response   from   andis .   bummer !
awesome   this   is   a   professional   quality   dryer   and   dries   my   hair   more   quickly   than   any   other   one   i   ve   owned ,   and   it   does   it   quietly .   it   s   also   very   lightweight   and   therefore   easy   on   my   arms   because   i   blow   my   hair   out   every   morning .   i   told   my   hair   stylist   what   i   bought   and   she   said   it   should   easily   last   me   5   years .   great   feedback   on   the   seller ,   too .   my   order   came   quickly   and   as   described .   new   in   box .
great !   this   product   works   great .   it   dries   my   hair   extremely   fast   and   does   not   leave   it   frizzy   that   s   a   plus   to   someone   with   curly   hair !
short   life .....   we   had   the   dryer   for   a   very   short   time   when   the   switch   would   no   longer   work .   it   is   almost   impossible   to   take   apart   to   repair   because   of   the   odd   screws ,   holding   it   together .   we   are   totally   disappointed   and   just   now   ordered   another   brand   through   amazon .   hopefully ,   this   one   will   not   be   disappointing .
good   thing   we   kept   the   old   one   got   this   conair   wallmount   hair   dryer   about   a   month   ago   to   replace   the   one   we   had   for   about   15   years   that   finally   blew   up .   it   s   the   most   convenient   dryer   you   can   own .   didn   t   even   have   to   replace   the   wall   mount   bracket .   new   unit   was   exactly   the   same   as   the   old .   but   gotta   say   i   m   really   glad   we   kept   the   old   unit .   the   rear   filter   screen   on   the   new   unit   fell   right   off   out   of   the   box .   the   2   little   tabs   that   snap   the   screen   onto   the   main   housing   were   like   melted   smooth   and   could   not   be   fixed .   but   the   screen   on   the   old   unit   was   an   exact   match .   so   snap   off ,   snap   on ,   and   viola ,   back   in   business .   lucky   for   us .   and   amazon .   or   they   d   have   to   pay   for   an   exchange .   and   we   d   be   stuck   using   a   clunky ,   10   pound   albatross   dryer   for   bout   a   week   or   so .   amazon   s   delivery   was   1   2   days   quicker   than   i   expected .   good   price   too .   oh ,   the   built   in   night   light   is   real   handy   too .   worked   great   for   at   least   15   years .
durability   i   really   like   this   hair   dryer   enough   to   buy   a   second   one .   the   first   one   made   a   popping   sound   and   quit   so   hopefully   this   one   will   do   better .

nice !   this   is   a   very   nice   hairdryer .   my   wife   and   daughters   have   many ,   and   this   one   has   quickly   become   the   default .   when   i   asked   them   why ,   i   got   the   shoulder   roll   and   i   dunno .   i   like   it .   so   there   you   go ,   about   the   best   one   can   say   for   a   nice   green   folding   hairdryer   in   this   price   range .   it   works ,   it   s   lightweight ,   and   gets   the   job   done .   great   for   traveling .
good   hairdryer   this   is   a   very   nice   hairdryer .   it   is   lightweight   and   i   love   that   the   cord   is   stored   inside   and   the   handle   folds .   it   is   not   overpowering   and   dries   my   hair   very   quickly .   i   would   highly   recommend   it .   it   is   easy   to   pack   if   you   want   to   take   it   with   you   on   a   trip .
wall   anchors   the   hair   dryer   itself   is   very   good   just   what   i   wanted ,   however , the   wall   anchors   that   the   dryer   is   secured   to   the   wall   with   are   useless .   dont   know   why   a   company   disregards   how   important   these   small   things   are   another   trip   to   lowe   s ! !
great   blow   dryer   but   be   careful   pulling   out   the   cord ...   the   reason   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   is   because   of   the   retractable   cord   and   the   folding   handle .   the   fact   that   it   s   a   great   dryer   and   ionic   was   a   plus .   my   only   complaint   is   the   cord   does   not   always   retract   back   into   the   dryer .   you   have   to   pull   it   out   and   try   again .   if   you   re   not   careful   and   pull   too   much   it   will   be   stuck   out   permanently .   this   happened   to   me   .   i   tried   taking   apart   the   dryer   to   fix   it   but   ended   up   throwing   the   blow   dryer   away   because   i   couldn   t   get   it   back   together .   i   bought   another   one   and   now   i   am   more   careful .
decent   dryer   this   conair   dryer   is   decent .   the   extension   makes   it   most   convenient   to   use   while   sitting   on   the   floor ,   which   can   be   convenient .   also   the   air   only   comes   from   out   of   the   back ,   and   not   the   front   or   the   sides ,   and   no   matter   what   the   setting   is   you   ll   need   to   be   under   the   dryer   for   at   least   an   hour .   but ,   for   the   price ,   and   if   you   can   find   some   comfortable   way   to   sit ,   it   is   worth   it   for   those   days   when   you   don   t   have   time   to   head   to   the   hair   salon .
great   dryer   works   well ,   dries   hair   quickly ,   and   it   does   reduce   frizzing .   very   light   for   its   size .   i   have   accidentally   turned   it   off   while   holding   it   a   few   times ,   but   it   s   easy   to   correct   by   holding   it   a   little   higher   up   it   s   not   really   a   big   deal .   definitely   worth   it   for   the   price .
is   good   i   think   that   the   hair   dryer   is   ok ... i   just   like   at   picture !   is   not   bad   for   the   cost ...   is   great   d
great   hair   dryer   this   is   a   very   good   qaulity   hair   dryer .   it   is   light   weight ,   has   plenty   of   power   and   yet   is   incredibly   quiet .   much   better   than   a   previous   version   that   had   the   power   but   also   the   added   weight .   the   andis   82005   closes   the   gap   between   merely   a   consumer   product   and   a   professional   dryer ,   but   retains   a   reasonable   price .
hair   dryer   the   product   works   perfectly .   other   dryers   suck   my   wifes   hair   into   the   intake ,   very   fine   hair .   this   dryer   does   not   do   that .   when   she   is   happy   so   am
no   warranty   i   would   not   purchase   this   item   again   from   amazon .   this   dryer   stopped   working   within   6   months   of   purchase   which   is   very   unfortunate   given   how   much   it   costs .
great   product   poor   quality   we   were   traveling   and   used   one   of   these   wall   mounted   hair   driers   at   a   hotel .   we   loved   how   the   product   worked   so ,   once   home ,   we   purchased   one .   well ,   the   product   switch   failed   in   the   first   4   months   and   we   contacted   the   manufacturer .   they   were   nice   enough   and   had   us   ship   it   back   and   sent   us   a   warranty   replacement   right   away .   the   replacement   lasted   about   the   same   amount   of   time ,   and   has   the   same   failure ,   the   switch   went   bad .   for   the   low   price   of   the   product   23.00   i   don   t   think   it   s   worth   sending   a   second   one   back   for   warranty   replacement .   shipping   two   units   back   is   going   to   cost   more   than   the   original   product .   really   nice   item ,   i   wish   that   they   made   it   of   quality   parts   i   would   surely   pay   2   3   times   the   price   to   get   one   that   will   last   longer   than   a   couple   of   months .   stay   away   from   this   item ,   seems   like   they   have   a   design   flaw   in   it .   two   with   the   same   switch   failure   in   the   same   amount   of   time  
the   best   blow   dryer   i   ever   had   i   am   a   hairdresser   for   20   years ,   i   ve   had   tried   so   many   different   blow   dryers   but   this   works   wonders   on   every   hair   types , no   other   blow   dryer   make   the   hair   silky   and   shiny   like   silver   bird , but   it   will   not   last   long   , like   in   two   months   it   will   brake ,   every   two   or   three   months   i   buy   new   one   as   i   did   not   find   a   better   blow   dryer   i   will   keep   buying   it ..
andis   hair   dryer   very   happy   with   product   very   quite   operationally .   it   was   a   bit   tricky   to   mount   on   the   wall ,   but   that   was   probably   just   me .
good   hair   dryer ,   some   annoyances   i   ve   had   this   hair   dryer   for   about   six   months .   i   like   the   diffuser   it   comes   with   along   with   the   different   temperature   options   and   high   medium .   it   does   help   my   hair   look   and   feel   smooth   and   healthy .   cons   the   blue   light   is   so   annoying   and   bright .   what   is   the   point   of   it   also ,   the   hair   dryer   is   not   quiet   like   other   andis   i   have   owned   and   about   half   the   time   when   i   turn   the   speed   to   low   it   varies   the   whole   time   its   on ,   switching   from   high   to   low ,   high   to   low ,   back   and   forth   not   the   switch ,   just   the   speed   of   the   air   .   very   odd .
good   for   the   price   i   ve   bought   this   dryer   four   months   ago   and   so   far   so   good .   it   s   not   the   best   that   i   ve   ever   had ,   but   works   well   for   the   price .
buena   inversion   excelente   vendedor ,   cumplio   con   los   tiempos   establecidos   y   el   porducto   se   llego   a   su   destino   en   perfectas   condiciones ,   recomendado   100  
broke   after   just   2   months   actually ,   i   really   loved   this   dryer .   it   made   my   hair   look   super   sleek   and   shiny ,   dried   fast   and   was   very   convenient   to   use .   unfortunately ,   it   broke   2   months   and   one   week   after   i   received   it .   basically ,   i   d   used   it   just   shy   of   two   months   and   i   don   t   dry   my   hair   every   day ,   so   we   re   not   talking   two   months   of   daily   use .   the   heating   element   stopped   working   and   now   it   only   blows   cold   air .   of   course ,   in   order   to   get   it   repaired   i   now   have   to   ship   it   to   florida   and   also   pay   them   10   to   repair   it   and   ship   it   back .   seriously ,   just   skip   this   item   and   save   yourself   the   trouble .   would   be   fine   if   it   worked ,   but   a   product   that   doesn   t   make   it   even   two   months   just   isn   t   worth   the   time   or   money .
great   blowdryer   when   i   first   pulled   it   out   of   the   box   i   was   surprised   to   find   that   mine   at   least   had   a   sparkly   finish   but   i   decided   to   try   it   before   passing   any   judgments   on   how   the   product   works .   i   m   happy   i   did .   the   dryer   has   6   settings   each   tailored   to   a   different   hair   type ,   which   is   great .   in   addition   to   that   handy   perk ,   it   also   has   instant   cool   for   setting   styles .   my   hair   is   always   very   soft   and   pretty   after   using   the   dryer .   glad   to   say   that   i   love   it !
pro   type   hair   dryer   without   the   pro   price   this   is   a   first   class   hair   dryer .   br   well   built .   looks   good   and   performs   better .   br   the   1800   watts   drys   your   hair   faster   than   the   typical   1500   watt   units   most   companies   sell   yet   the   motor   is   quieter   than   these   other   units .   br   the   only   point   that   some   may   consider   a   negative   is   that   it   isn   t   very   portable .   no   retracting   power   cords ,   no   folding   handles .   but   it   isn   t   meant   to   be   portable .   most   people   use   their   dryers   at   home   anyway   and   travelers   will   have   to   either   accept   its   somewhat   larger   size   because   of   its   superior   performance   and   lack   of   carrying   case   or   look   for   a   portable   unit .   br   br   this   dryer   has   three   speeds   where   most   dryers   only   have   two .   it   has   three   attachments ,   one   is   a   diffuser   t3   charges   an   extra   20   30   just   for   their   diffuser   alone   to   puff   up   your   hair   with   its   teeth   that   have   air   outlets   at   the   end   of   each   tooth   and   two   different   styles   of   concentrators   to   develop   very   high   air   speeds   and   concentrate   the   drying   for   quicker   performance   works   great   for   drying   a   spill   spot   on   your   clothing   .   br   br   it   also   has   a   cool   button   to   blow   cold   air   which   is   handy   for   spraying   hair   spray   and   then   fixing   your   hair   in   that   position .   i   find   it   also   handy   for   blowing   dust   out   of   the   fans   and   keyboard   of   my   computer   as   well .   br   br   finally ,   it   is   not   too   heavy   despite   its   thicker   plastic   construction .   some   have   criticized   it   as   not   having   a   metal   body .   it   disagree ,   a   metal   body   would   be   heavier   and   is   also   dangerous   where   electric   and   water   are   present ,   which   is   where   many   people   use   their   hair   dryers .   br   br   so   not   only   is   a   metal   body   more   tiring   to   use   for   any   amount   of   time   but   is   hazardous   to   your   heath   if   used   in   a   bathroom .   pro   dryers   may   be   metal   bodied   but   a   beauty   salon   is   not   a   bathroom   and   it   is   handled   by   a   beautician ,   not   yourself ,   so   the   dangers   are   minimized   a   great   deal .   br   br   if   you   want   a   pro   performing   dryer   without   paying   the   pro   prices   120   200   they   cost ,   this   is   the   dryer   for   you .
the   ferrari   of   hair   dryers   my   hairdresser   uses   this   hair   dryer   and   i   asked   her   about   it   since   it   always   leaves   my   hair   so   impeccably   styled .   i   went   ahead   and   ordered   it   here   and   i   m   very   happy   with   it .   elchim   is   solid ,   yet   lightweight ,   dries   hair   extremely   fast ,   is   surprisingly   quiet ,   and   it   leaves   my   hair   smooth   and   glossy .   super   long   cord   is   convenient ,   plus   its   beautiful !   it   looks   like   a   high   performance   sports   car .
best   hair   dryer   this   hair   dryer   is   reasonably   priced   for   the   quality   of   the   product .   the   sleek   design ,   quiet   operation ,   and   versatile   settings   were   what   i   was   looking   for   in   a   replacement   hair   dryer   and   this   product   delivers .   i   ve   only   used   it   twice   and   am   already   in   love   with   it .
ok   works   just   fine .   i   wish   i   had   ordered   a   cord   keeper   blow   dryer ,   but   that   s   my   fault .   in   terms   of   the   color ,   it   is   white   and   black   and   not   silver .   at   least   mine   was .
hair   dryer   the   size   and   weight   make   this   dryer   very   easy   to   use .   the   on   off   switch   was   difficult   to   turn   on   and   required   opening   up   the   handle   to   move   a   bunch   of   wires   out   of   the   way   that   were   blocking   it .
died   after   a   month   of   use   this   dryer   worked   fine   enough   for   about   a   month   after   i   bought   it   from   target   maybe   a   little   slower   than   my   normal   drying   time ,   but   overall   it   was   fine .   i   used   it   around   three   times   a   week   in   the   morning .   went   to   plug   it   in   yesterday   and   turned   it   on ,   and   nothing   happened   but   a   tiny   little   pop .   since   then   i   ve   tried   resetting   the   switch   on   the   plug   itself   as   well   as   tried   various   outlets   around   the   house .   something   seems   to   have   shorted   out   in   it .   i   figured   a   hair   dryer   was   a   hair   dryer   and   the   20   one   should   work   just   as   well ,   but   after   this   experience   and   after   using   better   ones   that   my   friends   have   had   serve   them   well   for   several   years   and   dry   my   hair   more   quickly ,   i   think   i   ll   pony   up   the   extra   20   and   save   myself   the   headache   of   having   to   buy   another   hair   dryer   in   the   near   future .   it   s   possible   mine   was   just   defective ,   but   even   if   it   hadn   t   gone   out   on   me ,   i   probably   would   have   gotten   a   nicer   dryer   for   myself   as   a   treat   at   some   point   anyway ,   knowing   how   often   i   use   blow   dryers   and   how   much   better   they   work   on   my   thicker   hair .
hair   dryer   blew   up   in   my   hand .... shocked   and   burned   i   purchased   this   blow   dryer   and   was   initially   happy   with   it   until   it   exploded   in   my   hand   while   i   was   drying   my   hair .   i   first   felt   a   weird   sensation   going   up   my   arm   and   then   a   huge   hot   stab   in   my   back   right   before   the   dryer   exploded   in   my   hand ,   with   pieces   flying   everywhere   the   motor   was   still   running   and   i   could   not   release   it   from   my   grip .   it   hurt   so   bad   and   feels   like   my   insides   in   my   back   are   on   fire !   not   only   am   i   in   pain ,   it   scared   me   pretty   bad !   i   will   be   getting   a   completely   different   dryer   now .   i   will   never   purchase   another   andis   dryer !
great   price   and   performance   some   have   commented   that   this   blow   dryer   is   heavy .   it   doesn   t   seem   heavier   than   any   other   powerful   dryer ,   and   it   dries   hair   twice   as   quick   as   others   we   ve   had   that   are   marketed   as   professional   strength .   my   daughter   s   hair   is   thick   and   very   long .   i   m   sometimes   asked   to   start   drying   it   while   she   puts   on   her   makeup .   it   s   a   request   i   welcome   any   moments   w   my   daughter   who   goes   away   to   college   are   stolen .   it   s   a   far   shorter   task   with   this   dryer ,   and   neither   of   us   end   up   sweating .   re   comments   about   the   attachments   not   staying   on   the   nozzle .   i   duly   noted   that ,   and   therefore   it   did   not   frustrate   me   when   i   found   that   was   sometimes   the   case .   we   re   not   big   attachment   users ,   and   i   know   where   the   duct   tape   is !   given   its   overall   performance ,   it   isn   t   a   deal   breaker .   i   ve   paid   a   lot   more   money   for   a   lot   less .   if   this   has   the   staying   power ,   and   doesn   t   burn   out   faster   than   more   expensive   ones   we   ve   had ,   it   will   rank   as   one   of   my   best   buys   from   amazon .
great   hairdryer !   this   is   by   far   the   best   hairdryer   i   have   ever   used .   i   have   a   very   sensitive   scalp   and   after   using   my   sisters   hairdryer   once   i   had   a   blistery   rash   on   the   back   of   my   head ,   i   never   want   to   go   through   that   again !   this   hairdryer   blows   teehee ,   strong   enough   for   my   thick   hair ,   distributes   enough   heat   so   i   don   t   have   to   get   close   to   my   scalp   at   all .   the   back   pops   off   so   you   can   clean   it   to   keep   the   air   circulation   as   strong   as   the   first   use ,   also   you   can   t   beat   the   price !   great   product .
salon   quality ,   works   well   this   is   one   sweet   hairdryer ,   stylish ,   well   made   and   looks   well   built .   i   got   the   whole   family   to   try   this   out   and   everyone   likes   it .   br   br   they   loved   the   attachment   that   helps   with   frizzled   hair   and   another   attachment   that   seems   to   give   a   flat   blast   out   of   the   dryer .   br   it   has   great   controls ,   hot   and   warm ,   with   three   speed   for   the   fan .   it   can   also   be   used   to   blow   cold   air   with   a   trigger   type   button   under   the   blower   section .   br   the   cable   is   long   enough   and   also   worth   mentioning   is   the   neat   box   it   came   in .   the   style   is   quite   interesting   but   not   overdone   and   it   sure   catches   the   eyes   of   my   kids   friends   who   frequently   come   over   to   help   each   other   with   their   hair   styles .   br   br   i   am   quite   pleased   with   this   hair   dryer ,   it   does   what   it   should   with   ease ,   style   and   power !
yellowbird   is   the   truth !   i   m   sooo   glad   i   bought   this   blow   dryer ,   it   gets   my   african   american   hair   really   straight   and   makes   flat   ironing   10   times   easier !   the   comb   attachment   is   the   best   part ,   next   to   the   hot   and   cool   switches   you   can   flip   to   the   position   you   want   without   having   to   hold   them   down .   buy   this   blow   dryer   and   you   won   t   want   another   one .
worth   the   money   i   have   been   using   this   blow   dryer   for   about   2   months   now   and   i   love   it .   it   dries   my   hair   very   quickly   and   the   attachments   stay   put   and   do   not   fall   off .   i   can   understand   why   some   of   the   other   reviews   say   the   cool   button   gets   in   the   way .   when   i   first   starting   using   the   dryer ,   i   accidentally   hit   the   cool   button   but   i   have   easily   adjusted   how   i   hold   the   dryer   so   this   no   longer   happens .   that   would   be   my   only   complaint   with   the   dryer .   other   than   that ,   i   love   it   my   hair   looks   great ,   it   takes   me   much   less   time   to   dry   my   hair ,   and   it   s   not   too   heavy .   i   am   happy   with   my   purchase .
conair   ionic   conditioning   pro   style   1875   watt   hair   dryer   i   wanted   a   hairdryer   that   has   warm   and   cool   settings   and   not   just   hot   and   hotter .   i   bought   it   to   dry   my   little   japanese   chin   after   her   bath .   she   hates   to   be   wet   and   the   conair   dries   her   in   about   10   minutes .
great   blow   dryer   this   hair   blow   dryer   is   superior   to   the   one   i   now   own .   i   particularly   like   the   titanium   ceramic   coated   grill   and   the   two   concentrators .   it   has   plenty   of   power ,   1875   watts ,   and   is   lightweight .   i   also   find   it   advantageous   to   have   3   heat   and   2   speed   settings .   i   was   not   familiar   with   this   brand ,   but   am   impressed .
more   than   expected   bought   this   for   my   wife   witch   has   a   lot   of   hair   and   is   very   picky   on   what   she   uses   for   it .   she   love   this   hair   dryer   more   than   the   one   ive   bought   in   the   past , which   were   really   expensive . this   is   a   great   buy , and   would   recommend   it   to   anyone .
it   s   great !   this   product   is   amazing .   it   dries   your   hair   really   fast   and   allows   it   to   be   as   straight   or   as   curly   as   you   want .   this   is   one   of   the   best   hair   dryers   i   have   ever   had ,   and   i   recommend   it   to   everyone .
conair   is   great !   in   my   rush   to   get   ready   for   work   in   the   morning ,   it   is   nice   to   have   this   extra   strong   dryer   to   blow   on   my   balding   head   after   my   shower   for   90   seconds   in   the   early   morning   light   and   make   it   appear   that   i   actually   have   more   hairs   than   i   do .   i   like   the   ability   to   choose   a   cool   as   well   as   a   hot   air   setting .   the   filter   unhinges   from   the   back   for   easy   cleaning .
really   good   hairdryer   expensive   and   heavy ,   but   really   good   this   is   a   really   good   hairdryer .   it   is   solidly   constructed ,   has   three   not   two   temperatures .   the   little   door   on   the   back   for   clearing   the   filter   is   hinged   rather   than   detachable .   it   is   nicely   balanced   in   the   hand .   it   comes   with   the   usual   attachments ,   which   i   don   t   use   so   can   t   judge .   br   br   it   dried   my   short   hair   in   about   15   seconds .   it   dried   my   visiting   sister   s   long   curly   hair   in   about   half   the   time   she   says   it   usually   takes   her .   this   is   partly   attributable   to   the   1875   watt   motor ,   but   i   ve   had   another   1875   watt   dryer   that   was   less   powerful .   br   br   the   virtues   come   with   two   possible   vices   this   thing   is   heavy ,   and   it   doesn   t   have   a   retractable   cord .   only   the   first   is   a   problem   for   me ,   as   retractable   cords   add   yet   more   weight   and   the   storage   area   for   them   unbalances   the   dryer   in   use .   br   br   of   course   it   is   on   the   expensive   side .   you   can   get   a   cheapo   hairdryer   for   15   or   a   good   one   for   30   35 .   you   ll   have   to   decide   whether   the   quality   and   the   features   are   worth   the   extra   cost .   this   one   will   last   longer   than   your   15   jobbie ,   and   it   really   does   a   better   faster   job .   it   s   also   fashionably   pretty   if   you   like   the   current   vogue   for   shiny   chromy   things .   br   br   mske   your   own   judgement   on   cost   benefit ,   but   i   can   testify   that   you   won   t   be   wasting   your   money .
great   hair   dryer   i   ve   only   used   this   dryer   a   few   times , as   it   is   my   travel   dryer   but   i   love   it .   the   ionic   feature   works   even   better   than   my   regular   ionic   dryer   in   smoothing   the   hair .   the   three   speeds   are   wonderful   and   very   hard   to   find   for   a   travel   dryer .   it   s   a   little   bigger   than   most   travel   dryers   but   folds   up   nice   and   compactly .   great   product   at   a   good   price .
great   dryer   for   the   price   this   blow   dryer   is   great .   really   leaves   my   hair   soft ,   shiny   frizz   free .   great   value   for   the   price .   would   highly   recommend .
a   perfect   dryer   when   you   re   short   on   time   why   is   this   hair   dryer   better   than   your   average   cheapie   dryer   well ,   most   importantly ,   it   s   1875   watts   dries   your   hair   very   quickly .   i   have   shoulder   length ,   straight ,   fine   but   fairly   thick   hair   and   this   drier   has   it   dry   within   5   minutes .   i   was   a   little   skeptical   about   the   ion   thing   at   first ,   but   i   have   to   admit   that   my   hair   does   feel   a   little   smoother   and   softer   after   using   this   dryer .   what   i   like   most   about   the   dryer   is   that   it   has   two   rocker   switches   with   lots   of   setting   possibilities .   one   controls   the   high   low   off   settings   and   the   other   controls   the   hot   warm   cold .   it   s   nice   that   you   can   do   them   in   any   combination   which   makes   for   a   lot   of   choices .   i   usually   am   in   a   hurry   and   use   the   hot   and   high   settings .   some   day   i   ll   start   getting   up   earlier   or   start   getting   ready   before   the   last   minute ,   but   until   then ,   i   need   a   dryer   like   this !   it   also   has   a   cool   button   so   when   you   re   styling   your   hair   and   have   a   section   of   hair   wrapped   around   your   brush   to   make   it   flip   up   or   under   you   can   hit   it   with   the   hot   air   first ,   and   then   the   cool   to   set   it   before   unwrapping   it .   this   works   so   well   and   so   quickly ,   that   it   s   one   of   the   first   hair   dryers   that   i   can   get   away   with   not   using   a   curling   iron   and   still   have   my   hair   styled   the   way   i   like   it .   br   br   this   dryer   is   very   spacey   looking   in   a   silver   gray   color   with   a   purple   blue   racing   stripe   down   the   side .   the   cord   is   gray .   i   guess   what   my   hair   dryer   looks   like   isn   t   that   big   of   a   deal   but   why   settle   for   a   drab   looking   one   when   you   can   have   one   with   a   little   pizzaz   it   comes   with   a   diffuser   and   two   other   attachments   for   directing   the   air   flow .   the   size   of   this   dryer   is   pretty   substantial ,   but   it   isn   t   too   heavy ,   it   s   just   a   nice   weight .   i   would   say   it   s   about   average   as   far   as   noise   goes .   i   ve   actually   had   travel   sized   hair   dryers   that   were   noisier   than   this   one .   all   in   all   it   s   an   excellent   dryer   that   does   exactly   what   i   want   it   to   do   which   is   to   dry   my   hair   quickly   and   leave   it   looking   soft   and   full .
good   but   not   great   i   m   not   a   hair   dryer   connoisseur ,   and   i   have   100   curly   hair   and   just   wanted   it   to   dry   my   hair   before   i   flat   iron   it   occasionally   but   it   kinda   leaves   my   hair   frizzy   and   not   smooth   like   it   says   i   can   only   compare   it   to   my   roommates   conair   hair   dryer   that   i   seemed   to   get   a   better   result   with .
compact ,   no   cord   mess ,   dries   my   big   hair !   i   love   this   hair   dryer .   first   saw   it   in   a   hotel   and   was   like   woah   no   cord   so   i   ordered   one   and   have   been   using   it   for   over   2   years   now .   works   perfectly .   stores   small ,   has   plenty   of   power .   br   br   now   i   am   curious   if   i   can   find   a   diffuser   attachment   for   it !   anybody   know   br   br   m
was   great   now   two   have   failed   in   a   year   i   was   looking   for   something   inexpensive   for   our   vacation   home   so   we   could   put   in   all   the   bathrooms .   bought   3   of   these   and   very   happy ,   works   better   than   the   more   expensive   ones .   have   not   had   any   problems   thus   far   and   works   great .   br   br   edit   dropped   this   to   one   star .   in   a   year   2   out   of   the   3   i   have   bought   failed .   one   sounds   like   a   bearing   failing   and   the   other   won   t   get   hot   anymore .   basically   they   are   cheap   for   a   reason .   one   that   failed ,   even   thought   a   year   old ,   was   only   used   maybe   10   times .
the   best   and   fastest   hair   dryer   i   ve   owned   this   is   the   best   hair   dryer   i   ve   ever   purchased ! ! !   it   has   cut   my   drying   time   down   to   20   minutes ,   i   have   shoulder   length   thick   hair   that   is   prone   to   frizz .   it   leaves   my   soft   and   smooth .   the   only   downside   is   that   it   gets   extremely   hot   and   can   burn   the   bristles   on   a   round   brush .   i   ve   had   to   try   out   different   brushes   that   stand   up   to   the   heat   and   a   tourmaline   ceramic   round   brush   is   the   best .   overall ,   i   would   recommend   this   to   everyone !
great   for   thick   hair !   if   i   am   to   be   honest ,   i   have   never   found   a   hair   dryer   that   i   truly   loved .   i   have   very   think   and   very   long   hair ,   so   finding   a   dryer   that   lives   up   to   the   task   is   hard   to   find .   my   hair   dryer   runs   for   a   good   30   minutes   straight   which   means   1 .   by   the   time   i   get   through   drying   my   hair   i   am   sweating   due   to   the   heat   needed   to   accomplish   this   task   and   2 .   my   arms   are   really   tired   by   the   time   i   m   done .   which   brings   me   to   the   2   things   i   absolutely   loved   about   this   hair   dryer .   br   br   it   didn   t   take   30   minutes   to   dry   my   hair .   it   took   about   15   and   my   face   never   felt   the   heat   from   the   dryer .   i   m   not   exactly   sure   how   this   happens ,   but   i   found   myself   on   several   occasions   actually   reaching   my   hand   up   in   front   of   the   dryer   to   make   sure   it   was   blowing   hot .   it   was .   all   i   felt   was   a   cool   breeze   on   my   face   while   my   hair   took   the   brunt   of   the   heat .   br   even   though   it   looks   really   heavy   i   kind   of   freaked   out   at   it   s   size   when   i   pulled   it   out   of   the   box   it   s   actually   quite   light   and   balanced ,   so   it   doesn   t   put   a   lot   of   stress   on   your   arm   while   you   are   styling   your   hair .   br   br   now ...   here   are   the   features   that   i   loved .   br   br   it   has   3   different   speeds   temps   allowing   you   to   mix   and   match   according   to   your   hair   type .   these   are   toggle   switches   br   it   has   a   locking   cold   button   so   you   don   t   have   to   struggle   while   setting   your   style   holding   down   a   button   at   the   same   time   br   it   came   with   3   different   attachments ,   2   directionals   and   a   diffuser   br   the   ion   actually   made   my   hair   shiny ,   so   much   so   that   i   didn   t   need   to   use   my   flat   iron   when   i   was   done   drying   my   hair .   br   br   overall   quality   product .   a   little   pricey ,   but   well   worth   the   money   if   you   have   difficult   think   hard   to   manage   hair .
enjoyed   it   while   it   lasted .   i   bought   it   in   nov .   of   2010   and   it   expired   in   july   of   2011 .   i   have   had   goldfish   live   longer .   i   was   using   it   and   it   suddenly   started   smelling   like   burning   rubber .   i   immediately   turned   it   off .   now   only   the   low   setting   works . i   have   very   short   hair   and   it   was   not   used   daily .   hmm .....
hot !   hot !   hot !   this   is   an   amazing   blow   dryer .   seriously ,   i   have   spent   money   on   models   that   cost   tons   more   and   this   has   to   be   the   best   blow   dryer   i   have   ever   used .   i   have   extremely   thick ,   coarse   hair .   they   could   use   it   to   reinforce   the   eiffel   tower   s   structure .   having   hair   like   this   usually   means   a   lot   of   time   and   a   lot   of   background   music   spent   in   front   of   the   mirror .   but   with   the   jf1 ,   i   had   great   results   and   a   true   cut   down   in   the   time   i   spent   on   my   hair .   and   using   the   diffuser   and   on   a   medium   setting ,   along   with   a   heat   protectant ,   i   didn   t   feel   as   if   i   was   frying   my   hair   to   death .   at   times ,   i   have   literally   seen   smoke   arise   from   my   hair   using   other   blow   dryers ,   even   on   a   low   setting .   br   br   i   highly   recommend   the   jf1 .   it   is   light   weight ,   not   as   gigantic   as   it   may   seem   ,   a   great   price   point ,   and   does   a   wonderful   job .   what   more   can   you   ask   for   !
best   blowdryer   ever ! ! !   we   used   this   blowdryer   in   a   hotel   and   liked   it .   couldn   t   find   it   in   any   stores   so   i   ordered   it   from   amazon .   after   we   got   it   my   husband   told   me   to   order   another   one   for   a   back   up   and   i   somehow   made   two   orders .   i   let   my   daughter   use   one   and   we   still   have   one   put   up   for   a   back   up .
a   premium   hair   dryer   through   and   through   my   first   impression   of   this   hair   dryer   is   its   heft .   it   is   not   overwhelming ,   of   course ,   but   feels   significantly   more   substantial   than   the   usual   plastic   laden   blowers .   it   looks   substantial   too ,   with   no   cheap   looking   material   anywhere .   br   br   all   the   normal   functions   are   there .   the   top   button   controls   hot   warm   cold ,   while   the   second   button   has   the   high   low   off   settings .   the   electric   plug   is   shock   proof .   and   a   quick   cold   button   is   placed   directly   under   the   index   finger .   br   br   once   turned   on ,   the   motor   immediately   makes   a   statement   of   its   superior   quality   with   its   calm   low   frequency   whirl   and   the   strong   yet   steady   airflow .   in   the   long   run ,   this   should   be   what   reminds   the   owner   that   he   she   has   gotten   his   her   money   s   worth .   the   air   filter   in   the   back   of   the   unit   is   sturdy   and   easy   to   clean .   at   1875w ,   the   heat   should   be   able   to   satisfy   anyone .   br   br   overall ,   the   quality   and   design   seem   more   than   enough   to   justify   the   price .   the   only   remaining   question   is   longevity .   but   time   will   tell .
nice !   nice !   nice !   this   is   the   best   hair   dryer   i   ve   ever   had   br   br   the   size   is   not   too   large   or   too   long   the   picture   makes   it   look   larger   than   it   actually   is .   it   is   light   weight .   the   handle   provides   a   perfect   grip .   the   motor   cools   down   very   quickly   and   the   casing   does   not   retain   heat .   br   br   the   buttons   are   all   you   could   possibly   ask   for   and   they   are   very   conveniently   located   right   on   the   handle   where   your   fingers   wrap   around   it .   you   don   t   have   to   shift   your   grip   or   stop   what   you   are   doing   to   change   a   heat   setting   or   blow   setting .   don   t   think   that   your   fingers   could   accidently   trip   a   botton   they   are   raised   buttons   and   have   a   definite   angle   and   curve   and   your   fingers   have   to   purposefully   push   them   one   way   or   the   other   to   make   changes .   the   cold   buttom   works   very   quickly ,   too .   br   br   there   is   a   loop   for   hanging ,   a   safety   plug   and   a   long   cord .   br   br   it   has   the   normal   attachments ,   plus   a   pretty   nifty   one   that   is   suited   for   nice ,   long ,   fine   hair .   it   will   be   able   to   help   lift   a   large   section   of   hair   and   shoot   many   channels   of   air   into   the   section .   br   br   last ,   but   not   least ,   it   is   a   beautiful   thing   to   look   at .   the   box   it   comes   in   is   classy ,   too !   i   got   goose   bumps   when   i   first   took   it   out   of   the   box   no   kidding !
fabulous !   i   can   t   believe   someone   didn   t   think   of   this   sooner !   best   product   i   have   bought   in   a   very   long   time .   love   having   two   hand   to   manipulate   my   hair   how   i   want   it .   i   am   very   pleased   with   the   strength   of   hold   the   suction   cup   has   on   my   mirror ,   the   whole   thing   feels   very   sturdy !
quite   a   nice   dryer ...   i   just   purchased   this   and   only   used   it   once   or   so   but   i   really   like   the   way   my   hair   feels   after   using   it .   it   s   a   bit   heavy   and   bulky   thus   the   one   point   off   ,   but   otherwise   quite   nice .   i   do   recommend   it ,   especially   at   the   current   price   and   shipping   deal .
very   powerful   hair   dryer !   i   liked   the   hair   dryer .   it   s   1875w   the   same   as   my   old   hair   dryer   but   the   air   seems   to   come   out   with   more   force .   it   s   not   too   heavy   which   is   good   because   i   m   a   weakling ,   the   cord   is   long   enough ,   it   s   easy   to   hold   and   dries   hair   very   quickly !   the   only   problem   for   me   was   the   switches   on   the   side   instead   of   in   the   front   because   they   were   right   where   i   hold   the   dryer   and   i   was   accidentely   hitting   them   the   whole   time   changing   the   setting   which   was   very   annoying !   overall ,   it   was   a   good   powerful   hair   dryer   if   you   are   able   to   deal   with   the   switch   placement .
disapointed ,   low   air   flow ,   not   suited   for   salon   use   i   like   the   fact   that   the   dryer   is   very   light   weight ,   but   i   think   i   have   used   toy   versions   that   blow   harder .   omg ....   i   tried   to   give   it   the   benefit   of   the   doubt ,   and   use   it   in   the   salon ,   and   it   caused   me   to   run   way   behind .   every   client   i   gave   up   after   15   30   min   and   used   another   dryer .   i   think   it   is   comparable   to   using   a   diffuser   to   get   a   strait   sleek   look ....   unfortunately   i   m   not   impressed .   i   m   sending   it   back .
didnt   have   luck   with   this   one   its   been   a   month   and   the   hair   dryer   stop   working ,   dont   know   what   happen   it   just   stop   working   and   letting   me   hair   wet
conair   pro   yellowbird   professional   hair   dryer   is   excellent   and   long   lasting   i   have   had   a   yellow   bird   blow   dryer   since   1976 .   i   replaced   mine   7   2011   35   years   .   so   you   can   see   this   powerful ,   durable ,   and   efficient   dryer   is   worth   it   s   money   and   more .   i   think   i   spent   15.00   on   it   back   in   76   and   that   averages   out   to   be   . 43   cents   per   year   for   my   investment .   no   wonder   it   is   hard   or   non   existent   to   find   in   beauty   stores ,   online ,   and   on   conair   s   website   it   is   not   available   on   their   website   .   i   love   all   of   the   settings   from   cold   to   very   hot .   it   comes   with   a   comb   i   don   t   use   it   anymore   since   i   have   dreadlocks   and   a   muzzle   that   narrows   at   the   tip .   i   would   also   recommend   this   model   to   any   beauty   salon   because   it   holds   up .
brilliant   hair   dryer ! !   this   hair   dryer   is   much   smaller   than   i   expected .   the   smaller   size   makes   using   the   nozzles   much   easier   for   those   of   us   that   don   t   have   chimpanzee   arms !   the   machine   is   also   really   quiet   and   efficient .
powerful   and   light ,   but   the   heating   coil   seems   to   be   overheating   i   love   how   this   hairdryer   is   so   powerful   without   being   heavy .   but   i   seem   to   have   a   problem   with   the   heating   coil ,   it   turns   a   bright   red   and   starts   smelling   like   its   burning   within   2   minutes   of   use .
just   what   i   wanted   all   i   need   is   a   basic   hair   dryer   with   several   heat   settings .   this   one   suits   my   needs   perfectly .   reasonable   price   for   a   good   product .
oster   1500   w   dryer   this   is   a   good   addition   to   a   bath   room .   especially   for   short   to   medium   length   hair . haven   t   tried   it   on   very   long   hair . not   too   noisy ,   easy   to   handle .   plenty   of   drying   power . e   z   mounting   to   wall .   bargain   at   this   price .
do   not   buy !   this   dryer   gets   way   to   hot .   it   over   heats   and   burns   your   hair .   i   am   still   waiting   for   my   hair   to   grow   back ,
exactly   what   i   needed   it   is   very   good   fan   for   the   price .   i   noticed   a   tremendous   difference   in   my   hair   even   with   the   summer   among   us .   the   only   thing   that   is   a   con   is   that   it   is   not   a   light   weight   fan .   otherwise   i   am   extremely   happy   with   my   purchase .
love   this   dryer ,   and   the   t   studio   flat   iron   i   have   long ,   thick ,   curly   hair   and   was   researching   good   dryers .   i   was   willing   to   pay   more   money   if   the   product   was   worth   it .   i   read   several   reviews   here   of   people   saying   they   have   tried   the   t3   and   that   this   dryer   is   better ,   so   i   bought   this   one   for   32 .   after   using   it   once   i   am   so   happy   with   it .   it   dried   my   hair   in   about   7   minutes ,   which   is   about   half   the   time   of   my   old   dryer   which   wasn   t   even   a   bad   dryer   to   begin   with   .   my   hair   came   out   looking   so   much   smoother   and   more   tame ,   and   as   a   result   i   spent   less   time   with   the   flat   iron .   i   have   the   companion   remington   t   studio   2   1   4   flat   iron   asin   b001lf4g4y   remington   s   9400   tstudio   collection   digital   ceramic   hair   straightener   with   tourmaline   2   1   4   wide   plates   ,   and   love   it   just   as   much .   between   the   two   items   and   a   little   macadamia   nut   oil   i   finish   my   long ,   difficult   hair   in   about   15   minutes ,   and   it   s   smoother   than   ever ,   and   even   holds   better   in   the   humidity .   it   s   amazing ,   i   can   t   see   any   reason   to   spend   more .
wanted   to   like   it ,   design   flaws   then   dies   i   rarely   write   reviews ,   but   i   wanted   to   warn   others   of   my   experience   which   seems   to   be   very   common   with   this   hair   dryer .   there   are   not   many   wall   mount   hair   dryers   to   pick   from ,   and   i   mostly   liked   this   one   while   it   worked .   bright   night   light   can   be   good   or   bad ..   i   liked   it   ,   nice   physical   design ,   and   decent   power .   i   thought   the   air   volume   still   did   not   compete   with   most   15   standard   dryers ,   but   if   you   are   not   looking   for   big   air   volume ,   it   is   fine .   my   wife   misses   a   cold   button .   so   in   all ,   a   mediocre   hair   dryer   but   with   great   wall   mount   convenience   and   bright   night   light .   now   with   the   issues ...   bought   18   months   ago ,   worked   fine   except   overheated   very   easily .   if   used   on   high ,   it   would   run   as   long   as   you   want   till   you   shut   it   off ,   then   the   internal   temperature   would   apparently   overheat   with   no   more   airflow ,   and   would   refuse   to   turn   back   on   for   5   minutes   or   so .   annoying ,   but   i   got   used   to   it   by   going   to   medium   heat   for   about   10   seconds   before   shutting   it   off   every   time .   that   seemed   to   cool   it   down   just   enough   not   to   trigger   the   temperature   limiter   in   case   i   needed   to   turn   it   back   on   right   away .   i   probably   would   have   pitched   it ,   but   i   liked   the   wall   mount   convenience   and   put   4   holes   in   my   wall   to   mount   it .   well ,   here   we   are   18   months   of   life ,   and   now   it   is   completely   dead .   night   light   on   but   the   hair   dryer   is   not   home .   i   am   electrically   capable   and   could   probably   open   up   and   fix   this   thing ,   but   it   is   not   worth   the   safety   concern .   if   you   want   to   pay   a   premium   for   wall   mount ,   just   know   you   might   only   get   a   year   or   two   out   of   it ..   others   seems   to   have   similar   experiences .   sad   that   the   10   hand   held   models   seem   to   last   much   longer .   anyway ,   to   cover   up   the   holes   in   the   walls ,   i   am   trying   one   of   the   other   few   wall   mount   options   out   there   by   another   manufacturer .   if   this   one   dies ,   i   am   giving   up   on   wall   mount .   good   luck ...   hair   dryers   should   not   take   this   much   thought .
awful   hairdryer   ruined   my   hair   since   i   purchased   this   hair   dryer   my   hair   has   never   been   in   worse   shape   than   now ..... it   caused   the   top   of   my   hair   to   break   off   in   several   different   places .   the   a   c   motor   does   not   help ! ! !   i   m   going   back   to   conair ! !   never   had   a   problem   with   them ! ! !   i   am   devistated ! ! !   do   not   buy   this   product ! ! !
conair   travel   hair   dryer   the   conair   ts127   travel   smart   mini   hair   dryer   is   not   as   small   as   i   thought .   be   sure   to   read   the   dimension .   the   handle   of   the   blow   dryer   folds   down   which   is   good   if   you   need   to   conform   to   a   space   within   your   luggage .   the   high   speed   option   on   the   dryer   is   powerful   and   it   does   dry   hair   quickly .   i   do   wish   there   was   a   low ,   medium ,   and   high   option .   overall   i   am   satified   with   the   purchase   since   i   only   travel   2   3   times   a   year .
geat   blower   this   is   the   second   one   of   this   model   my   wife   owned .   the   blower   fan   severed   off   the   spindal   on   the   last   one   we   had .   hopefully ,   it   won   t   happen   again .   regardless ,   we   were   very   happy   with   the   price   on   amazon .   the   items   was   over   80   dollars   in   the   salon   when   she   bought   it   about   a   year   ago .   the   dryer   appears   to   be   very   heavy   duty   and   good   enough   to   be   used   at   the   hair   salons .
great   price ,   robust   power   in   a   little   package   i   came   across   this   while   staying   at   a   best   western .   it   impressed   me   there   immediately .   i   love   how   this   little   guy   packs   a   big   punch   in   a   little   package .   i   wanted   something   that   isn   t   monstrous   and   a   labor   to   hold   up   to   use .   also   it   doesn   t   take   up   much   wall   real   estate   a   big   plus   .   the   night   light   is   a   neat   feature   and   won   t   create   a   distracting   moon   glow   that   will   bleed   into   the   bedroom .   it   also   doesn   t   demand   any   quirky   requirement   to   place   it   back   in   its   mount .   it   easily   snaps   right   back   in   without   any   trouble   unlike   you   find   with   some   cordless   tool   mounts .
purchased   new   looks   used !   product   arrived   very   poorly   packed .   the   item   was   purchased   new   but   looks   like   a   refurbished   used   blow   dryer .   will   be   expected   damage   and   low   or   no   life   expectancy .   would   like   a   new   one !   very   disappointed   with   my   purchase !   asin   b000lqb5ys   t3   bespoke   labs   83888   se   special   edition   evolution   professional   ionic   ceramic   tourmaline   hair   dryer  
a   great   and   convenient   set   up   this   dryer   is   perfect   for   those   with   medium   to   short   length   cuts .   if   you   have   a   3   foot   long   mane   of   thick ,   beautiful   hair   or   a   maybe   pile   of   the   dredds ,   forget   this   one ,   that   s   not   the   intention .   wall   mount   is   very   convenient   and   appealing   for   guests .   the   price   is   good ,   it   s   easy   to   install   and   is   quite   functional .
fast   dryer   i   really   thought   the   ionic   drying   system   was   just   tech   hype ,   but   this   thing   really   dries   quickly !   we   use   it   mainly   to   dry   the   dog   just   point   it   at   a   spot   on   his   fur ,   and   it   s   dry   within   seconds .   it   s   a   big   dryer ,   and   not   as   quiet   as   we   d   hoped   still   scared   the   dog   a   little   at   first .
lousy   design   pros   dries   hair .   folds   in   half .   cons   awkward   buttons   that   won   t   budge   at   first ,   then   leap   past   the   desired   setting .   retractable   cord   should   be   called   stuffable   cord .   stopped   working   after   6   months .
worked   great   in   italy   i   purchased   this   dryer   for   a   trip   to   italy   it   worked   perfectly .   it   has   a   switch   so   i   can   use   it   in   either   the   usa   or   when   i   travel   abroad .   please   note   the   directions   read   to   only   use   on   low   setting   when   overseas   but   the   air   volumne   was   still   very   good   i   have   thick   hair !   you   will   need   an   adaptor   for   it   for   international   travel ,   but   not   a   convertor .   overall   very   good   product ,   lightweight   and   durable .
works   great   and   looks   great ,   can   t   complain   i   needed   to   replace   my   conair   wall   mount   hair   dryer   since   the   tab   that   helps   hold   the   dryer   on   the   wall   broke   off .   so   fortunately   i   found   this   beauty   which   matches   nicely   with   my   black   and   oil   rubbed   bronze   fixtures   in   my   bathroom .   i   like   the   led   light   also   as   it   makes   the   bathroom   feel   very   modern .
conair   hair   dryer   with   cord   keeper   this   hair   dryer   works   well .   the   various   settings   dry   soaked   hair   as   well   as   damp   hair .   the   price   was   right .   the   cord   keeper   is   a   practical   aspect ... no   more   wrapping   the   cord   around   the   dryer .
great   dryer   works   great ,   quiet ,   fast   drying .   took   away   1   star   because   it   is   a   little   on   the   heavy   side ,   and   the   placement   of   the   switches   is   a   little   awkward .   otherwise   very   satisfied .
so   loud   my   ears   crackle !   i   loved   the   idea   of   a   hair   dryer   with   a   retractable   cord ,   and   i   have   always   had   success   with   conair   in   the   past ,   so   i   was   so   disappointed   when   i   started   using   the   cord   keeper   and   found   it   was   just   too   loud   to   use .   i   literally   had   to   put   my   finger   in   my   left   ear   to   keep   it   from   crackling   when   i   used   this   dryer .   i   mentioned   that   i   had   to   take   a   hair   dryer   back   to   the   store   when   my   son   and   daughter   in   law   were   visiting ,   and   they   said   they   had   a   hair   dryer   that   was   too   loud   too .   it   turns   out   it   was   the   same   model !
great   very   good ,   love   the   ionic   feature   it   dries   your   hair   fast   and   prevents   frizziness .   also   a   very   good   price .   br   br   only   downside   is   the   handle   can   be   difficult   to   grab   without   hitting   the   switches .   there   is   one   relatively   small   opening   in   between   the   two   switches   temperature   switch   power   switch   for   one   finger   to   grasp .   sometimes   results   in   accidentally   hitting   the   switches .   but   other   than   that   it   is   great !
the   bonnet   collapses   and   is   so   hot ,   i   hold   it   up   with   a   clothespin !   i   use   this   dryer   exclusively   for   when   i   color   my   hair   with   a   henna   because   henna   is   heat   activated .   so   i   do   not   use   rollers   but   just   put   the   bonnet   on   after   applying   the   henna .   not   sure   why   the   byline   says   from   a   12   year   old   reader .   the   high   setting   does   a   great   job   activating   the   henna ,   but   the   bonnet   is   so   heavy   that   it   collapses   on   top   of   my   head   and   is   so   hot   that   it   would   burn   if   i   did   not   hold   it   up   manually .   except   since   the   bonnet   gets   too   hot   to   touch ,   i   attach   a   clothespin   to   it   and   hold   the   clothespin   up   for   the   50   minutes   that   the   henna   is   cooking .   it   may   work   better   with   rollers ,   but   the   best   idea   would   be   to   make   a   lighter   bonnet   that   puffs   up   on   its   own ,   like   the   one   that   came   with   the   old   carel   dryers .   when   i   called   the   manufacturer   to   tell   them   that   the   bonnet   acts   that   way ,   they   were   defensive .   if   they   could   fix   that   problem ,   they   d   have   a   much   better   dryer .
lasts   a   long   time   my   grandson   and   i   both   use   this   as   a   leave   in   conditioner .   i   have   thin ,   light ,   bone   straight   hair   and   he   has   thick ,   full ,   stand   up   in   the   air   hair   and   it   works   for   both   of   us ,   particularly   him .   with   it ,   his   hair   is   more   manageable ,   shiny   and   healthy   looking   and   mine   doesn   t   float   around   so   much .   we   ve   been   using   it   for   several   years .

great   for   home   shellac   manicures !   after   getting   a   couple   shellac   manicures   i   decided   to   invest   in   my   own   home   manicure   set   up   and   this   light   works   great   for   doing   your   own   nails .   fits   one   hand   or   foot   just   fine   and   has   2   3   5   minute   timers .   i   won   t   go   past   2   minutes   so   don   t   see   a   need   for   the   other   two   really .   item   was   packaged   well ,   with   all   4   light   bulbs ,   very   easy   to   install   the   light   bulbs   and   wa   lah   good   to   go !   i   just   could   not   see   spending   over   150   on   one   of   these   lights   for   home   use   so   bought   this   one .   it   works   the   same   as   the   one   at   my   local   salon   with   one   exception   no   fan .   maybe   that   s   the   additional   cost   of   the   higher   priced   one   and   someday   i   may   decide   to   spend   that   kind   of   money ,   but   for   a   2   minute   curing   this   light   is   great .   if   you   are   into   the   new   gel   or   shellac   style   manicures   to   grow   your   own   nails   long   and   strong   it   s   worth   the   investment !   you   ll   spend   the   same   amount   of   money   in   2   3   months   as   you   will   on   setting   up   your   own   home   manicure   kit .   i   do   feel   bad   for   my   manicurist   so   i   ll   probably   still   go   see   her   for   pedicures !
the   classic   deo   this   is   by   far   a   classic   fragrance   from   polo .   polo   sport ,   still   going   strong   a   great   classic   must   have   from   the   90   s .
philips   norelco   bodygroom   summery   this   product   is   great   when   used   for   intended   purpose ,   however   its   cheap   construction   means   it   has   a   limited   life   span .   pros   it   is   gentle   and   easy   to   use   on   very   hard   to   reach   places .   cons   after   about   2   years   of   use   the   button   broke ,   stuck   in   the   depressed   position ,   meaning   i   can   no   longer   turn   the   thing   on .   its   great   for   soft   body   hair ,   not   great   for   anything   above   the   neck .   review   initially   this   seemed   like   a   great   purchase ,   it   shaves   reasonably   close   but   at   no   danger   of   nicking   the   skin   no   matter   what   awkward   angle   you   use .   it   seems   simple   and   sturdy   and   easy   to   clean .   no   one   wants   details   as   to   where   and   how   this   product   was   used ,   but   i   will   say   if   you   re   hoping   for   a   multitasking   razor   this   isn   t   it .   i   would   occasionally   use   this   guy   to   trim   my   beard   when   i   had   one ,   and   it   worked   okay ,   but   sometimes   snag   the   larger   hairs ,   needed   multiple   passes ,   etc .   this   isn   t   a   big   deal ,   i   think   you   need   the   right   tools   for   the   job   and   prefer   this   being   a   good   body   hair   trim   and   sub   par   beard   trimmer   than   having   something   that   was   average   at   both .   what   really   lost   stars   was   the   product   s   history   of   breaking   through   no   fault   of   the   user .   unfortunately ,   even   though   it   feels   pretty   sturdy   and   reliable   it   will   end   up   breaking .   now   i   know   nothing   last   forever ,   but   i   think   for   an   electronics   device   that   costs   40   that   one   only   gently   uses   for   a   few   minutes   every   week ,   it   should   be   functional   or   repairable   for   more   than   a   couple   years .   sadly   norelco   is   the   only   company   that   makes   body   hair   razors   that   seem   to   work   well ,   so   i   replaced   my   broken   trimmer   with   a   more   expensive   one   hoping   it   lasts   longer .   i   don   t   feel   good ,   though ,   about   endorsing   norelco   with   a   repeat   purchase .
timewise   cleanser   arrived   in   good   condition .   i   ve   only   used   the   product   for   about   2   weeks .   i   haven   t   noticed   any   changes   in   my   skin   yet .
i   was   skeptical   but   was   pleasantly   surprised   i   have   tried   at   least   2   other   products   that   did   not   work   for   me   because   i   am   very   sensitive   to   chemicals   and   even   plant   materials   in   cosmetics .   this   has   occured   to   me   even   with   cosmetics   that   claim   to   be   hypoallergenic .   eye   revival   not   only   worked   to   moisturize   and   reduce   the   circles   under   my   eyes   but   also   did   not   produce   any   allergic   reactions .   i   am   overjoyed   that   i   have   found   a   product   that   works   and   that   i   can   use   long   term .   no   more   wasted   time   or   money !
it   works ... just   not   like   i   thought   it   would   when   i   first   bought   this ,   i   was   not   a   skeptic   about   it .   as   someone   who   largely   believes   in   science ,   i   am   very   well   aware   that   pheromones   do   exist .   i   ve   also   always   wondered   what   it   would   be   like   to   wear   these   pheromones .   after   exhausting   the   internet ,   it   seemed   that   all   i   could   find   were   pheromones   catering   to   heterosexual   men .   then   i   found   this ,   and   again ,   believing   that   it   would   work ,   i   bought   it .   unfortunately ,   after   using   it   for   a   few   days   now ,   i   do   not   notice   any   differences   in   the   way   people   gay   straight   male   female   interact   with   me .   they   have   however   taken   notice   to   the   scent ,   and   they   love   the   scent ,   but   i   see   no   noticeable   sexual   excitement   in   other   gay   men ,   or   increased   mood   and   friendliness   of   straight   men .   soooo ,   it   is   now   my   belief ,   that   the   synthesized   pheromone   technology   does   not   work   in   this   cologne .   however ,   its   not   a   total   disappointment ,   as   i   ve   said ,   everyone   does   love   the   smell ,   so   i   will   continue   to   wear   it   as   a   regular   cologne .   but   i   was   hoping   for   the   pheromone   technology   to   kick   in ,   which   never   did ...
neutral   the   product   works   but   i   was   disappointed   in   it .   speedstick   deodorant   works   just   as   good   when   applying   a   tattoo   stencil   and   is   extremely   cheaper .
seems   to   do   its   job !   i   m   using   this   as   recommended   in   conjunction   with   the   acquarella   nail   polish .   it   works   as   a   clear   polish ,   as   well .   the   best   thing   about   it   is   that   it   does   not   trigger   contact   dermatitis   or   cause   nail   pitting   like   the   drug   store   stuff ,   so   i   m   excited   about   that !
crest   3d   white   strips   at   first   i   didnt   like   the   way   they   went   on   ,   they   kind   of   slipped   around   when   placing   them ,   but   the   stayed   once   they   were   in   place ,   the   stayed .   after   a   few   times   of   usage   i   did   see   some   results .   my   teeth   are   whiter   but   next   time   i   will   purchase   a   stronger   method
i   have   been   a   mentadent   user   for   many   years !   i   have   used   mentadent   ever   since   it   came   on   the   market .   i   always   liked   the   way   it   was   packaged   in   a   pump ,   rather   than   a   tube   and   liked   the   flavor   of   the   product .   i   always   thought   that   it   was   doing   a   great   job   cleaning   and   protecting   my   teeth   and   eliminating   tartar ,   and   my   feelings   were   validated   when   my   dentist   asked   me   how   come   you   don   t   have   any   tartar   this   time   i   had   been   using   mentadent   for   approx .   8   months   at   that   point   i   told   him   what   i   was   using   and   he   just   sort   of   nodded   and   said   well ,   something   is   working !   at   my   next   checkup   it   was   the   same   story   little   to   no   tartar !   he   could   not   believe   it   and   remarked   that   it   was   also   whitening   my   teeth   1   shade   whiter   in   about   a   year   of   use !   mentadent   contains   peroxide   a   couple   of   years   ago   i   added   a   sonicare   toothbrush   to   my   arsenal   and   since   then   my   teeth   have   gotten   2   more   shades   whiter !   i   could   not   be   more   pleased   with   mentadent   and   i   was   thrilled   to   find   it   on   amazon   for   such   a   great   price !   i   immediately   signed   up   for   automatic   shipments   of   6   refills   at   a   time ,   as   i   am   no   longer   able   to   find   it   in   my   local   stores .   i   have   stocked   up   from   amazon   bought   18   refills   in   may   2011   and   will   continue   to   do   so   at   every   opportunity   as   i   dont   ever   want   to   do   with   out   my   mentadent .   o   update   may   2011   i   am   so   bummed   and   actually   a   little   angry   that   amazon   has   suddenly   decided   to   drop   the   subscribe   save   option   on   the   advanced   cleaning   formula   mentadent   that   i   had   been   buying   from   them   for   years .   o   they   tried   to   be   helpful   and   suggested   that   i   replace   this   s   s   item   with   an   advanced   whitening   item   of   a   similar   price .   this   will   not   work   for   me   as   after   2   wks   of   use   the   advanced   whitening   makes   my   teeth   very   sensitive !   seriously ,   if   they   want   to   be   helpful   and   show   that   they   appreciate   all   the   years   that   i   have   been   a   loyal   customer   of   this   and   many   other   items   from   them   they   should   reinstate   the   s   s   option   for   the   advanced   cleaning   formula   that   they   still   carry .   o   what   s   next   suddenlythey   won   t   even   offer   this   formula   of   mentadent   at   all   o  
best   nose   ear   trimmer !   hey   guys ,   i   have   to   tell   ya ,   i   have   tried   many   nose   ear   trimmers ,   but   by   far   the   philps   norelco   nt9110   is   the   best   i   have   ever   used   or   bought .   this   philps   norelco   9110   is   absolutely   the   best !   if   you   follow   the   instructions   rinse   and   brush   it   out   after   every   use   this   product   will   last   who   knows   how   long .   i   have   had   mine   for   2   months   now ,   and   not   a   problem   with   anything .   it   dose   the   job   of   trimming   my   nose   ear   hair   better   than   what   i   exspected ,   all   i   can   say   is ,   you   will   not   be   disapointed   with   the   performance .   best   regards ,   greg .   p . s .   thanks   a   lot   phillps   for   making   an   exceptional   product .
came   quickly   enough ,   great   quality   if   you   want   quality   foundation   you   re   going   to   have   to   pay   for   it .   i   bouught   a   physician   s   formula   foundation   and   wow ,   what   crap   that   was ,   their   sponge   they   sell   with   the   compact   won   t   even   fit   in   their   compact .   but   this   gabriel   compact   is   great ,   the   foundation   is   superb .
leaves   skin   clean   and   smooth .   i   purchased   this   soap   due   to   the   reviews   on   youtube .   it   s   a   good   cleanser   but   im   not   sure   if   ill   be   re   purchasing .   i   think   the   black   soap   in   solid   form   from   coastal   scents   performs   much   better .   this   one   smells   like   cigarette   ash   which   really   grosses   me   out .   won   t   leave   your   skin   smelling   like   it   though ,   so   don   t   worry .   doesnt   smoothen   the   skin   as   much   as   i   thought   it   would ,   but   it   does   leave   a   nice   clean   feeling   and   smoothens   the   skin   more   then   most   cleansers   out   there .
amazing ! ! !   this   sponge   arrived   sooner   than   expected   and   as   described ,   in   brand   new   condition .   this   is   an   amazing   product   and   i   will   be   purchasing   again !
all   in   one   choice   instead   of   choosing   among   the   four   options ,   i   decided   to   buy   the   big   pony   collection   coffret   so   i   could   have   then   all   at   once .
my   perfume   this   is   the   only   perfume   that   i   love .   luckily ,   even   though   it   s   off   the   market   for   years ,   amazon   is   still   selling   the   inventory .
very   strong   smell   i   have   tried   several   of   the   100   pure   lotions .   one   common   theme   is   that   they   all   have   a   pretty   strong   scent .   this   vanilla   scent   to   me   was   completely   overpowering .   very ,   very   strong   too   much   so   though .   br   br   as   far   as   the   lotion ,   it   really   is   one   of   the   few   that   is   totally   pure .   i   love   that .   but   the   lotion   itself   for   me   doesn   t   work   as   well   as   others .   it   s   fairly   runny ,   and   doesn   t   moisturize   my   skin   very   well .   i   will   not   be   purchasing   this   brand   anymore   because   of   that .
quantum   perm   i   have   used   quantum   for   over   20   years   through   all   it   s   changes .   i   have   tried   numerous   other   kind   but   always   return   to   quantum   because   it   is   the   only   one   that   can   handle   my   difficult   hair .   it   is   a   great   product .
waste   of   money ,   fraud   the   description   of   this   item   is   not   accurate .   it   doesn   t   specify   that   it   won   t   fit   most   of   the   tubs .   when   i   got   it   i   saw   that   my   tub   is   too   high   for   it ,   but   it   was   too   late   they   don   t   allow   a   return   even   if   bench   wasn   t   unpacked .   waste   of   money .
very   hard   to   find   these   brushes ....   these   brushes   seem   to   be   near   extinct .   it   s   the   only   type   of   hairbrush   that   my   husband   wants   and   has   used   for   a   lot   of   years .   bought   2   just   in   case .
not   tear   free   kids   shampoo   product   is   nothing   special ,   especially   since   most   kids   shampoos   are   tear   free   i   was   disappointed   to   find   that   it   burned   my   6   month   old   sons   eyes .   boo   hoo .   will   not   purchase   again
love   it   this   is   a   really   nice   mild   smelling   body   wash   that   certainly   does   wonders   for   dry   skin .   love   it .   ordered   it   twice , esp .   at   ths   sale   price .
nice   pick   great   pick   for   servicing   scuba   gear .   use   it   for   removing   o   rings .   strong ,   not   really   bendable ,   which   is   good .
smell   of   heaven   this   is   really   worth   everything   it   stands   for   no   wonder   it   is   a   classic .   it   is   incredible .   i   never   bought   a   perfume   without   smelling   it   before   this   one ,   my   god   i   did   not   regret   it .   this   was   absolutely   amazing .
couldn   t   find   these   in   stores   with   items   like   this ,   i   think   most   of   us   are   creatures   of   habit   and   prefer   to   use   what   we   re   used   to   using .   if   it   s   worked   well   for   45   years ,   that   s   a   pretty   good   recommendation .   that   s   how   i   feel   about   these   revlon   tweezers .   mine   which   i   ve   really   had   for   about   45   years ,   i   think ,   mysteriously   disappeared   recently .   someday   they   ll   probably   just   as   mysteriously   reappear .   in   the   meantime ,   i   couldn   t   find   a   replacement ,   have   never   been   able   to   use   the   flat   edged   ones ,   and   was   reluctant   to   spend   a   lot   of   money   on   expensive   tweezers   that   get   somewhat   mixed   reviews .   since   the   latter   two   categories   were   the   only   types   i   could   find   in   my   local   stores ,   i   was   glad   to   find   the   revlon   tweezers   here .   and   you   know   what   as   i   m   sitting   here   typing   this ,   it   occurs   to   me   that ,   now   that   i   know   these   are   the   real   deal ,   i   d   be   a   fool   not   to   go   ahead   and   order   another   pair ,   while   they   re   still   available ,   just   in   case   my   new   ones   disappear   anytime   within   the   next   45   years .   i   think   i   ll   do   that !
fresh   fragrance   on   the   go   love   the   aroma   of   this   little   stick   of   perfume .   so   clean ,   a   touch   of   lemon   and   easy   to   carry   anywhere .
i   don   t   have   to   go   to   the   salon   anymore   i   used   to   go   to   the   salon   every   2   weeks   where   i   got   acrylic   nails   and   an   airbrush   design ,   i   gave   that   up   a   little   over   a   year   ago ,   i   really   missed   the   nail   art   but   now   i   can   do   it   myself   with   the   konad   plates !   i   think   its   neat   because   i   can   change   my   nail   colors   more   often   than   what   i   could   in   the   salon ,   and   the   whole   reason   i   liked   going   to   the   salon   was   because   i   liked   nail   art ,   now   i   can   do   it   myself   as   often   as   i   like   so   if   i   get   bored   with   a   color   i   don   t   have   to   wait   2   weeks   to   remove   it ,   i   can   redo   my   nails   myself .   i   only   have   a   few   complaints ,   the   full   nail   designs   are   a   little   hard   to   do   across   your   thumb ,   i   think   they   could   be   a   little   wider   and   its   hard   to   do   on   a   color   wheel   the   plastic   wheel   of   nails   that   people   use   as   swatches   in   salons   unless   you   have   the   double   sided   stamp   and   use   the   small   stamper   which   works   great   on   like   an   accent   design   like   a   flower   or   a   star   but   not   so   well   on   a   full   nail   design .   it   s   kind   of   time   consuming   and   tedious   because   you   have   to   wipe   everything   off   between   each   nail .   also   if   your   new   at   this   i   recommend   starting   with   a   design   that   doesn   t   cover   the   entire   nail .
excellent   value !   this   was   so   cheap   but   the   product   is   not   excellent   quality ! !   love   it   and   use   it   a   lot !
great   set   up   clippers !   i   m   no   hairdresser   but   to   me   these   clippers   feel   like   a   professional   set .   they   re   heavy   and   sturdy   and   powerful !   they   have   a   thick ,   no   nonsense   cord .   just   sturdy !   oh ,   and   they   cut   hair   really   well   too ,   no   more   catching .   i   d   recommend   these   for   sure !
clean   effective ,   lovely   finish   i   m   always   afraid   of   product   being   greasy   and   or   clogging   my   skin .   with   moisture   surge ,   there   s   no   fear   of   that .   it   smoothes   on   easily ,   is   instantly   absorbed ,   and   leaves   a   lovely   surface   for   applying   makeup   or   if   in   neck   area   just   feeling   soft   and   enriched .   i   use   my   fingertips   for   application   and   they   are   also   left   completely   dry   in   mere   seconds ,   so   no   searching   for   a   rag   or   tissue   to   mop   off   excess ...   there   simply   isn   t   any   need .   you   can   immediately   put   the   top   back   on   the   tube   to   save   it   from   drying   out .   having   moderate   skin ,   i   can   only   guess   that   someone   with   excessively   dry   dermis   might   not   find   this   sufficiently   moisturizing .   also   just   a   guess   the   younger   you   are ,   the   less   you   probably   need .   i   m   not   a   spring   chicken   and   i   find   a   little   does   go   quite   a   way .   there   is   no   odor   and   no   wetness   left   a   few   seconds   after   application .   just   lovely   feeling   skin .   i   wish   i   could   afford   a   larger   size ,   as   this   is   not   inexpensive   my   rationale   for   4   of   5   stars   only   .   oh ,   and   one   final   trick   for   this   or   any   product   always ,   but   always ,   feather   upwards   from   chest   to   chin   don   t   give   gravity   any   more   help   than   it   naturally   has !
this   is   awesome !   i   have   curly   african   american   3c   hair   that   is   prone   to   breakage ,   tangling ,   brittleness   and   snapping .   this   makes   my   hair   easily   detangle ,   smells   like   gardenia   flowers .   it   is   a   tan   color   with   a   creamy ,   buttery   texture .   it   doesn   t   exactly   make   hair   shine ,   but   is   great   for   a   leave   in   conditioner   and   makes   hair   even   curlier .   i   liked   the   price   for   the   amount   that   you   get   of   7oz .   it   doesn   t   weigh   hair   down   and   is   not   oily .   this   is   perfect   for   any   ethnic   hair   type   or   wavy   curly   hair   for   non   ethnic   hair .   when   i   put   it   on   my   hair   i   instantly   noticed   the   difference .   i   love   this   and   plan   to   buy   it   for   as   long   as   they   make   the   product .
love ,   love ,   love   this   product ! ! ! ! ! !   what   a   great   product !   there   is   a   little   learning   curve ,   but   really   application   just   takes   a   little   time .   you   can   cut   the   strips   in   half   and   get   two   applications .   the   most   important   thing   to   remember   is   to   rub .   rub ,   rub   the   shield   on   your   nail .   i   do   it   while   watching   tv .   great   longevity ,   my   nails   out   grew   the   shield !   made   my   nails   grow   super   fast   and   they   are   really   strong .   be   patient ,   you   will   be   glad   you   did .
works   like   a   charm   but   don   t   go   crazy   while   us   pediatricians   strongly   urge   parents   to   leave   the   earwax   removal   to   professionals ,   people   in   asia   do   this   all   the   time .   i   was   able   to   see   the   earwax   with   the   light   and   gently   scoop   out   the   canal .   the   big   scoop   and   the   tweezers   were   too   big   for   his   9   year   old   ears   but   the   smaller   scoop   worked   perfectly .   br   br   warning   do   not   try   this   on   yourself   or   go   too   deeply   in   the   canal .   it   s   long   enough   to   do   some   real   damage .
five   years   and   still   great   bought   it   back   in   05 ,   after   a   sales   person   at   walmart   saw   i   was   going   to   purchase   a   100 ,   and   recommended   this   one .   it   has   worked   great .   too   bad   i   left   it   behind   on   my   last   trip .
love   it ! ! !   this   is   such   a   great   product .   it   is   easy   to   apply   and   it   does   much   for   my   lashes .   no   more   fake   lashes   for   me .   lash   extensions   does   it ! ! !
the   greatest   cleanser   there   is   no   other   cleanser   that   compares   to   this   one .   its   worth   the   price .   it   leaves   your   face   feeling   clean   and   moisturized .   no   dry   feeling   here .
it   s   alright   if   you   ask   me   this   product   doesn   t   work   much   different   than   the   redken   full   frame   07   protective   volumizing   mousse .   the   mousse   works   better   than   the   lotion   it   never   makes   your   hair   flat   not   even   in   the   back .   i   even   tried   a   reviewer   s   tips   and   it   didn   t   make   a   difference .   i   have   fine   hair .   i   ll   continue   to   use   it   because   it   makes   my   hair   soft .
it   s   ok   it   works   but   i   always   end   up   having   a   sore   throat   the   next   morning ..   br   br   maybe   because   i   swallow   some   but   hey   it   works   and   cheap
in   home   peel   there   are   not   many   in   home   peel   treatments   on   the   market   any   more ,   which   is   unfortunate .   this   peel   does   an   excellent   job   of   exfoliating   and   is   not   over   drying   like   some   alpha   hydroxide   peels .   however ,   the   concentration   of   alpha   beta   hydroxides   is   relatively   low   compared   to   what   you   may   get   at   a   dermatologist .   even   on   my   sensitive   skin   i   did   not   get   overly   red   or   flakey .   additionally ,   this   peel   seems   to   helped   with   oil   control   on   my   oily   skin   especially   when   used   consistently   over   time .   i   do   have   a   few   complaints ,   one   is   the   smell .   although   it   is   not   over   powering   it   takes   a   bit   of   getting   used   to ,   it   smells   like   the   old   lanse   sa   treatments   at   the   hair   salon .   another   complaint   is   i   do   suffer   from   acne   and   this   product   seems   to   aggravate   acne   problems   if   used   during   a   break   out .   a   word   of   warning ,   this   stuff   is   very   difficult   to   get   out   of   hair   so   be   careful   where   you   apply   it .   with   all   that   said   it   is   a   luxurious   treatment   that   helps   exfoliate   skin   in   a   way   no   exfoliating   rinse   can   do ,   and   helps   with   oil   control .   i   have   not   noticed   any   dramatic   wrinkle   reduction   or   dark   spots   disappearing   like   the   professional   peels   deliver .
  beautiful   texture   i   just   recieved   this   unit   today   in   the   mail   and   it   looks   and   feels   so   natural ! ... most   wigs   and   lacefronts   have   a   very   shiny   and   unreal   look   when   you   get   them   but   this   one   looks   exactly   like   relaxed   african   american   hair !   i   ordered   two   in   the   color   1   but   will   def   be   ordering   more   in   another   color   soon ! ... ladies   if   you   re   thinking   of   getting   this   unit   to   use   as   a   protective   style   or   just   to   change   up   your   look ....   you   def   won   t   be   disappointed ..  
goyeguy   these   radius   toothbrushes   are   amazing !   i   ve   been   using   them   for   about   8   years   now .   at   first   my   dentist   commented   on   how   much   cleaner   my   teeth   were ,   and   how   healthy   my   gums .   they   last   far   longer   than   any   other   toothbrush   which   more   than   makes   up   for   the   added   cost .   you   can   t   go   wrong   with   these .   note ,   however ,   that   they   do   take   a   few   days   to   get   used   to ,   as   the   feel   is   different   from   typical   brushes .
mac   prep   and   prime   lip   videoid   mo24gsvudpbxxj8   hello ,   this   is   megan   doing   a   review   on   this   product   for   you .
great   prroduct   inexpensive   product   that   made   my   hair   very   smooth   for   flat   ironing ,   i   highly   recommend ,   loved   it .   i   am   going   to   order   it   again .   if   you   order ,   buy   two ,   it   s   not   very   big   and   you   certainly   don   t   want   to   run   out   since   you   will   be   instantly   hooked .
buyer   beware ...   while   this   product   does   do   what   it   claims   as   far   as   brassiness   goes ,   it   turned   out   way   darker   than   the   medium   brown   on   the   box .   my   hair   was   a   light   medium   reddish   brown   before   and   now   it   s   dark   brown !   luckily ,   it   was   a   pleasant   surprise   for   me .   maybe   not   so   much   for   the   next   gal ...
love   it   i   was   really   impressed   with   the   amount   of   rhinestones   i   got   and   the   colors   on   the   picture   here ,   don   t   do   it   justice !   they   are   so   much   brighter   and   gorgeous !   love   it   and   totally   worth   the   money ! ! !
not   sizes   indicated   the   picture   shows   an   8   oz   bottle   and   5   oz   toothpaste .   at   that   size   it   d   be   a   good   deal .   what   you   actually   receive   is   a   3.4   oz   bottle   and   a   teeny   tiny   bottle   of   toothpaste .   lost   it   on   vacation ,   so   can   t   post   actual   size .   the   actual   product   is   good ,   but   don   t   buy   this   version   of   it .
there   is   no   place   like   home !   this   is   a   really   fabulous   red   sparkle   polish .   it   s   a   good   product   and   i   treated   myself .   it   s   a   bit   hard   to   take   off ,   but   most   sparkle   polishes   are .   as   much   as   i   like   the   product ,   i   do   feel   it   is   a   bit   over   priced ,   especially   when   you   add   shipping .   if   i   was   to   come   across   this   brand   again ,   in   store ,   i   would   buy   it ,   if   it   was   a   color   i   had   to   have .

it   works   it   works .   just   like   the   one   it   replaced .   first   time   charging   is   quite   slow ,   so   be   prepared .   also   the   rubber   coating   on   the   last   one   of   these   i   bought   discolored   quickly ,   and   the   one   before   that   the   coating   became   sticky   after   a   while .   i   am   hoping   this   third   one   is   better .

lasted   2   weeks   i   absolutely   loved   this   dryer .   it   was   very   nice   and   hot   and   quit   working   at   about   2   weeks .   there   was   an   electrical   smell   as   if   wires   were   burning ,   then   it   stopped   working .   total   fail .   it   s   a   dangerous   dryer   based   on   other   reviews   and   my   own   personal   experience   plus   a   waste   of   the   money   spent   on   it .
best   blower   the   best   hair   dryer   ive   owned .   it   has   super   power   and   i   love   that   it   came   with   attachments !   a   must   have .
great   dryer   i   read   numerous   reviews   on   hair   dryers   and   picked   this   one .   it   s   easy   to   hold   because   of   the   rubberized   grip .   excellent   selection   of   heat   and   speed   settings   which   are   simple   to   control   on   the   handle .   i   have   fairly   straight   hair   and   it   leaves   my   hair   soft   and   shiny .   hopefully   it   will   last   several   years .
excellent   no   other   hair   dryer   could   touch   the   amazing   job   that   this   one   does   in   half   the   time   with   no   frizz !   love   it !
underpowered   among   other   things ....   so   one   day   i   forgot   my   revlon   rv484   dryer   when   i   went   to   the   gym .   no   problem   since   there   are   communal   hair   dryers   i   can   use .   that   day   i   found   out   how   underpowered   this   hd   was   compared   to   other   1875w   dryers   out   there .   br   br   my   hair   is   thick   with   a   slight   wave   to   it .   i   like   to   get   it   as   straight   and   clean   as   i   can .   i   don   t   like   frizz ,   i   don   t   go   crazy   with   styling ,   i   don   t   do   the   just   out   of   bed   look   either .   i   had   been   using   this   dryer   for   a   little   over   2   years   with   the   concentrator .   br   br   while   true   enough ,   it   did   dry   my   hair   and   i   could   get   it   relatively   straight   as   long   as   it   isn   t   very   humid   ,   it   took   quite   a   bit   of   time   and   fussing   to   get   it   that   way .   and   by   the   time   i   was   done ,   i   had   a   bunch   of   small   hairs   going   every   which   way   on   the   top   of   my   head   that   i   would   need   to   smooth   over   with   product .   br   br   if   i   needed   my   hair   perfect ,   like   if   we   were   going   out ,   that   means   i   left   it   in   a   turbie   for   30   45   min   instead   of   my   usual   day   to   day   10   min .   that   way   it   comes   out   relatively   straight   with   little   frizz   again ,   dependant   on   humidity   i   guess   if   you   take   that   into   consideration ,   this   works   fine   if   you   have   loads   of   time   in   the   morning .   me   i   like   my   sleep .   br   br   now ,   the   air   was   hot   enough   but   the   amount   of   air   that   was   coming   out   was   not ,   even   on   the   high   speed   which   it   was   on   for   2   years !   .   i   wish   i   would   have   figure   that   out   back   then   and   exchanged   it   for   something   else .   br   br   there   were   two   features   on   the   dryer   that   i   could   not   tell   you   what   they   do ,   they   never   seemed   to   work   or   show   a   difference   in   styling   for   me   the   ion   switch   and   the   cold   air   blast .   my   hair   dried   just   as   slowly   with   the   ion   switch   on   or   off   and   the   cold   air   blast   was   never   cold   or   room   temperature ,   it   always   just   felt   like   the   hot   air   was   coming   out .   br   br   my   other   complaint   is   the   attachments   for   it .   the   diffuser   and   the   concentrator .   i   think   i   used   the   diffuser   once   but   it   suffers   from   the   same ,   if   not   a   little   more ,   complaint .   the   attachments   are   held   onto   the   dryer   by   a   little   hump   of   plastic .   with   any   force ,   they   pop   right   out .   very   frustrating   when   you   re   trying   to   get   the   dryer   and   a   brush   through   your   hair   and   the   concentrator   keeps   popping   off   and   falling   on   the   floor .   br   br   i   did   like   the   rubber   hook   on   the   base   of   the   dryer ,   it   came   in   handy   for   hanging   the   dryer   on   the   side   of   my   vanity   when   not   in   use   before   i   started   packing   it   for   the   gym   .   and   the   whole   thing   is   light   enough . lastic .   with   any   force ,   they   pop   right   out .   very   frustrating   when   you   re   trying   to   get   the   dryer   and   a   brush   through   your   hair   and   the   concentrator   keeps   popping   off   and   falling   on   the   floor .   i   did   like   the   rubber   hook   on   the   base   of   the   dryer ,   it   came   in   handy   for   hanging   the   dryer   on   the   side   of   my   vanity   when   not   in   use   before   i   started   packing   it   for   the   gym   .   and   the   whole   thing   is   light   enough .
good   hair   dryer ,   if   you   don   t   mind   buying   a   new   one   in   6   months .   i   purchased   this   hair   dryer   less   than   6   months   ago .   i   use   it   every   other   day   at   most .   this   morning   i   woke   up ,   showered ,   started   to   blow   dry   my   hair   and   discovered   that   the   heating   element   had   gone   out   and   all   i   can   get   now   is   cold   air .   considering   that   i   paid   40   for   this   dryer   at   my   local   sally   beauty   supply   i   was   mad   because   i   have   had   way   cheaper   ones   that   lasted   way   longer .
i   just   hope   i   can   return   it !   this   might   just   be   the   worst   hair   dryer   i   have   ever   tried .   i   have   curly   hair   that   i   usually   blow   dry   straight ,   no   problem ,   but   with   this   one   i   could   not   get   it   straight   ended   up   just   resigning   myself   to   using   my   flat   iron   on   the   still   damp   but   very   frizzy   fried   mess   i   ended   up   with .   as   another   reviewer   commented ,   you   have   to   destroy   the   packaging   to   get   it   out ,   but   i   am   going   to   do   my   best   to   get   it   back   in   there   sealed   up   to   return   as   this   was   just   a   waste   of   money .   an   extra   star   for   the   retractable   cord   though   that   would   have   been   great   had   this   been   a   dryer   i   could   tolerate .
adjustable   heat   control   this   hair   dryer   is   larger   than   i   expected   as   reviews   led   me   to   believe   that   it   was   small   and   light ,   but   it   works   very   well   on   both   low ,   medium   and   high   heat   and   is   satisfactory .
still   working   after   2   years   i   don   t   blow   dry   my   hair   everyday ,   so   it   hasn   t   gotten   a   good   solid   workout   like   ones   i   ve   used   in   the   past .   that   being   said ,   i   do   like   this   hairdryer .   it   is   easy   to   travel   with   and   doesn   t   weigh   a   ton   can   easily   hold   it   with   one   hand   without   your   wrist   tiring ,   while   the   other   hand   is   styling   with   a   brush .   the   retractable   cord   is   still   working   although   at   times   it   takes   several   tries   to   get   it   to   completely   retract   now .   worked   very   well   when   i   first   received   it .   only   started   having   trouble   with   that   part   over   the   past   several   months .   the   control   is   a   single   control   where   the   heat   setting   and   volume   of   air   setting   are   the   same   low   air   flow   and   cooler   air ,   highest   air   flow   with   highest   heat .   if   you   want   separate   air   flow   and   heat   settings ,   this   isn   t   the   dryer   for   you .
don   t   buy   for   the   concentrator   i   hate   this   hair   dryer .   sure ,   it   dries   efficiently ,   and   i   like   the   retractable   cord   feature   which   you   sometimes   have   to   coax   along ,   and   the   cord   is   too   short   ,   but   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   for   the   concentrator   the   attachment   that   allows   you   to   dry   a   very   small   and   specific   are   like   at   the   salon   .   it   just   snaps   on ,   instead   of   having   a   twist   lock   or   something   which   means   if   you   so   much   as   tap   it   say ,   with   the   brush   you   re   using   to   style   ,   the   attachment   flies   off .   every   single   morning .   the   switch   is   also   a   pain   in   the   butt   hard   to   manipulate .   like   i   said ,   it   works   fine ,   but   i   m   going   to   buy   a   different   model   so   that   i   don   t   drive   myself   crazy   every   day .
great   air   flow ,   but   heavier   than   my   previous   dryer   i   love   the   look   of   this   dryer   the   red   is   so   cool !   and   it   has   a   more   reasonable   airflow   than   most   of   the   dryers   i   ve   tried .   i   don   t   need   that   much   force ,   just   enough   to   get   my   hair   dry .   it   also   lets   you   pick   from   several   different   combos   of   heat   air   flow   force .   the   only   con   is   that   it   weighs   more   than   my   previous   dryer ...   but   not   enough   to   make   me   send   it   back .   overall ,   i   m   pleased   with   this   purchase .
awful   dryer !   i   purchased   this   dryer   because   of   the   features   that   it   offered   retractable   cord ,   folds   for   storage ,   multiple   heat   and   power   options   which   would   be   great   if   i   could   turn   it   on   and   off !   as   it   is ,   i   fight   the   controls   which   makes   it   impossible   to   use .   and   quiet   not   in   my   world !   this   thing   is   loud   with   a   very   high   pitched ,   screeching   tone   much   like   fingernails   on   a   chalk   board .   i   m   returning   this   one .   it   s   not   worth   the   effort .
oster   wall   mount   hair   dryer   good   product   i   had   seen   these   before   in   various   hotels   motels .   last   week   i   asked   the   maintenance   person   at   the   place   d   armes   about   these   units ,   and   was   told   that   they   were   very   reliable ,   my   favorite   criteria .   br   br   i   ordered   two   on   2   day   prime   shipping   and   received   them   the   very   next   day .   they   are   unbelievably   easy   to   install ,   and   work   flawlessly .   no   more   dryers   on   the   lavatory   with   the   cords   catching   on   the   cabinet   knobs .   br   br   two   thumbs   up .
hot   tools   too   hot !   the   hot   tools   prof .   800   watt   ionic   soft   bonnet   hair   dryer   is   too   hot   on   high   and   too   cool   on   low   cool .   it   is   uncomfortable   to   use   it .   i   am   not   sure   what   my   next   step   is   going   to   be ,   but   i   cannot   recommend   this   product .
conair   cord   reel   223   hair   dryer   i   am   so   glad   amazon   had   this   product !   it   is   a   fabulous   hair   dryer .   i   have   one   upstairs   and   one   in   my   downstairs   bathroom .
simple   and   functional   we   used   it   in   a   hotel   and   liked   it   so   we   bought   2   from   amazon .   various   wind   speed .   the   air   is   never   too   hot .   the   wind   is   never   too   powerful .   it   dries   your   hair   quickly .   light   weight ,   foldable   handle   plus   retractable   cord   make   it   easy   to   travel .   i   paid   20   out   the   door   with   amazon   prime .   it   s   better   than   dryers   that   are   much   more   expensive .   now   we   ll   just   have   to   see   how   long   they   last .
absolutely   love   this ! ! !   i   have   very   thick   and   corse   curly   wavy   hair   and   i   love   this   hair   dryer ! !   it   s   nice   and   compact   but   has   a   lot   of   power .   it   dries   my   hair   in   half   the   time   it   used   to   with   other   bigger ,   more   expensive   dryers .   i   first   used   this   in   a   hotel   i   stayed   at   and   came   on   here   the   minute   i   got   home   to   order   it .   for   me ,   it   s   been   so   worth   it !   love   this ! !
hurricane   or   puff   of   breath ....   two   extremes   this   blow   dryer   has   two   settings ...   hurricane   or   puff   of   breath .   not   much   in   between .   it   s   great   for   getting   your   hair   dry   in   a   hurry ,   but   if   you   re   used   to   styling   with   a   blow   dryer   it   presents   a   bit   of   a   challenge .   it   is   fairly   light ,   which   is   why   i   bought   it .   overall ,   it   is   ok .
very   powerful   dryer !   however ,   it   is   a   little   heavier   than   my   other   hair   dryers .   but   it   dries   hair   very   quickly   the   different   heat   settings   work   nicely .   dryer   is   comfortable   to   hold   and   is   powerful   hot   enough   that   i   can   hold   it   6   8   inches   from   my   head   and   it   will   still   dry   my   hair   effectively .   my   only   problem   with   the   hair   dryer   is   that   it   is   somewhat   too   powerful   to   use   the   diffuser   if   i   want   to   dry   my   naturally   curly   hair   into   curls .   even   on   the   low   power   setting ,   it   blows   my   hair   to   hard   and   the   curls   go   all   over   the   place   and   don   t   form   nicely .   if   i   want   to   have   curly   hair   for   the   day ,   i   use   one   of   my   other ,   less   powerful   dryers .   works   great   for   my   straight   hair   days ,   though !
good   dryer   i   have   had   this   product   for   a   month   and   a   half   it   it   has   worked   wonderfully   every   morning .   not   too   loud ,   not   scorching   hot ,   dryes   hair   quickly ,   and   i   love   the   portability .   i   the   retractor   need   a   little   help   by   pushing   the   cord   in   a   bit   at   times   and   it   easily   snaps   to   fold .   fits   great   in   my   small   drawer   in   the   bathroom !
my   wife   is   happy   the   last   blow   dryer   we   bought   cost   almost   100.00   when   it   broke   i   headed   my   wife   off   and   purchased   this   one   from   amazon   and   my   wife   said   it   was   as   good   as   the   100.00   one   we   had .
get   s   the   job   done   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   because   i   did   not   enjoy   sitting   under   my   overhead   dryer .   i   have   very   thick   hair   and   it   would   take   me   up   to   2   hours   or   more   sitting   in   one   position   while   being   very   conscious   to   not   slouch .   the   conair   sb1   bonnet   hair   dryer   allows   me   to   be   more   flexible   with   where   i   can   dry   my   hair .   before   i   would   have   to   be   seated   near   a   table   only .   now   i   can   sit   on   the   couch   or   even   lay   on   the   bed .   i   have   put   this   on   and   taken   a   nap   while   it   dried   my   hair .   it   can   be   a   bit   uncomfortable   since   the   hose   gets   hot   after   sometime   and   will   touch   your   skin ,   so   it   does   require   some   adjustment   there .   the   benefits   though   were   worth   it   to   me .   i   would   definitely   recommend   this   product   to   anyone   who   has   long   hair   drying   times   and   would   like   to   be   able   to   sit   at   their   pc   or   watch   tv   or   just   have   their   hair   dry   while   they   take   a   nap   or   go   to   bed   at   night .
waste   of   money !   the   dryer   was   great   for   about   3   weeks .   it   was   easy   to   install   and   had   tons   of   power .   it   dried   my   hair   faster   than   my   old   dryer   and   was   extremely   light   weight ,   however ,   it   died !   i   was   drying   my   hair   and   it   looked   like   something   was   on   fire   inside   and   about   30   seconds   later   it   shot   a   streak   of   fire   out   and   quit .   the   heat   source   still   works   but   the   motor   won   t .   i   am   really   disappointed   with   this   purchase .
really   great   hair   dryer   i   initially   purchased   this   to   use   as   a   travel   blow   dryer   mainly   for   the   gym   .   it   turns   out ,   that   it   works   better   than   the   one   i   keep   at   home .   i   have   fairly   thick   hair ,   and   it   s   gone   from   chin   length   to   an   inch   or   so   below   my   shoulders   since   i   bought   it .   pros   dries   my   hair   very   quickly   retractable   cord   is   awesome   don   t   need   to   deal   with   winding   it   around   the   dryer   folding   handle   is   awesome   as   well   takes   up   less   space   when   storing   not   bulky   cons   very   heavy ,   and   thus   not   very   portable   which   defeats   my   intended   purpose
great   hairdryer   for   the   price   i   bought   this   dryer   to   replace   my   conair   nano   silver   tourmaline ,   which   i   loved   dearly .   i   ve   tried   a   number   of   other   conair   dryers ,   and   none   of   them   got   quite   hot   enough ,   so   i   figured   i   d   give   this   one   a   try .   my   hair   mid   back ,   quite   thick ,   wavy   curly   and   frizz   prone .   i   usually   dry   it   straight   with   a   round   brush   instead   of   flat   ironing ,   so   i   need   a   dryer   that   gets   very   hot .   things   i   like   about   the   dryer   1 .   great   heat   settings .   my   old   dryer   went   from   hot   to   scalding .   this   one   blows   truly   cold   air   for   the   cool   shot ,   cool   air   on   low ,   warm   on   warm ,   and   scalding   on   hot .   i   was   surprised   by   how   well   it   dried   my   hair   on   warm   i   usually   use   the   highest   setting   the   whole   time   ,   but   i   did   need   to   use   the   hottest   setting   to   get   my   hair   straight .   this   dryer   gets   hotter   than   anything   i   ve   tried   in   this   price   range ,   which   for   me   is   a   huge   plus .   2 .   relatively   quiet .   it   sounds   like   a   hair   dryer ,   but   is   considerably   quieter   than   any   other   product   i   ve   tried .   3 .   good   weight   feel .   other   reviewers   have   said   it   s   heavy ,   but   at   least   compared   to   the   other   conair   dryers   i   ve   used ,   i   d   say   it   s   about   the   same ,   maybe   lighter .   definitely   not   a   problem   unless   you   re   used   to   a   really ,   really   lightweight   dryer .   the   surface   is   nice   and   grippy ,   and   the   balance   feels   good .   overall ,   i   m   very   satisfied .   it   dried   my   hair   quickly ,   can   attain   the   heat   i   need   but   doesn   t   limit   you   to   scaldingly   hot   ,   and   didn   t   cost   an   arm   and   a   leg .   highly   recommended !
andis   hair   dryer   problem   i   bought   one   of   these   and   it   lasted   1   month .   great   customer   service   sent   me   another   and   now   three   months   later   the   same   thing   happened .   the   low   speed   switch   burns   out .   unfortunately   this   time   amazon   bails   out   and   makes   you   deal   direct   with   the   manufacturer   for   return .   i   m   going   to   conair .
late   in   coming   hair   dryer   amazon   was   very   responsive ,   but   the   manufacturer   did   not   mail   out   the   product   to   my   home   in   an   appropriate   amount   of   time .   the   distributor   had   to   be   prodded   by   amazon   to   fulfill   my   request .   the   product   is   just   perfect   for   my   wife ,   but   the   delay   was   not   pleasant .
best   blow   dryer   ever ! ! !   i   never   right   reviews   but   had   to   say   how   much   i   loooove   this   blow   dryer .   i   have   really   thick   hair   and   this   blow   dryer   cuts   my   drying   time   in   half .   i   absolutely   love   it   and   would   recommend   it   to   anyone .   ...  
conair   225rx   comfort   touch   tourmaline   ceramic   1875   watt   hair   styler ,   black   my   wife   loves   this   hairdryer .   it   has   multiple   speeds   and   settings   and   even   the   hot   setting   doesn   t   get   too   hot   for   her .   it   s   lightweight   and   not   too   big .   still   easy   to   travel   with   also .
very   satify   for   the   price   and   perfornance   have   used   this   hair   dryer   for   more   than   2   weeks .   it   works   pretty   well .   it   has   enough   heat   for   the   different   settings .   it   seems   to   have   less   statics   compare   to   my   old   hair   dryer .
fantastic   this   blowdryer   is   excellent   it   can   handle   my   lion   s   mane   of   hair .   it   is   light   to   hold ,   easy   to   hold   and   use   and   high   quality   construction .   the   fekkai   salon   on   5th   avenue   nyc   uses   these   dryers   which   is   why   i   ordered   it .   i   will   note   that   the   cord   is   surprisingly   thick   and   heavy   compared   to   other   regular   retail   store   blow   dryers ,   but   it   provides   a   generous   length .
low   speed   not   hot   enough   i   love   everything   about   this   dryer   except   the   low   speed   while   on   hot   is   not   hot   enough .   it   feels   like   it   s   blowing   cool   air .
vidal   sassoon   dryer   this   hair   dryer   works   great .   my   hair   is   dry   in   no   time   at   all .   can   t   beat   the   price   either .
not   as   good   as   the   previous   tourmaline   i   have   thin ,   fine   hair   and   need   to   heat   rapidly   cool   the   roots   while   back   brushing   to   get   lift   and   fullness .   i   had   the   previous   model   of   this   blow   dryer   and   it   worked   very   well   for   this   purpose .   unfortunately ,   after   about   a   year   the   blower   switch   broke   right   in   half .   i   bought   this   one   to   replace   it .   i   like   that   the   dryer   is   reasonably   priced   so   i   didn   t   feel   too   ripped   off   at   having   to   buy   a   new   one .   this   one   has   a   couple   of   manufacturing   changes ,   though ,   that   i   felt   were   downgrades .   first   and   foremost ,   this   one   has   a   6   cord ,   where   the   previous   model   had   a   9   cord .   the   cord   doesn   t   swivel ,   so   the   extra   length   gave   me   more   flexibility   in   movement ,   whereas   this   one   makes   the   dryer   seem   cheap .   second ,   remington   changed   the   direction   of   the   blower   switch ,   rather   arbitrarily ,   so   that   up   is   now   off   instead   of   high .   i   know   this   sounds   petty ,   but   that   change   removed   the   automaticity   of   my   hand   movements   completely   and   i   couldn   t   see   a   good   reason   to   change   it .   it   probably   won   t   be   a   problem   for   you   if   you   didn   t   have   the   earlier   model .   the   drawback   to   the   original ,   which   is   still   a   drawback   on   the   current   model ,   is   that   it   has   so   much   power   even   in   the   low   setting   that   when   i   m   back   brushing   i   don   t   have   good   control   over   the   hair .   on   the   earlier   model   i   felt   this   was   still   workable   and   if   you   want   lots   of   blow   power   this   model   definitely   fits   the   bill .   i   ended   up   coming   across   a   babyliss   pro   porcelain   ceramic   that   i   could   try   before   buying ,   and   even   though   it   cost   more   i   bought   it   anyway   and   am   keeping   this   one   as   my   spare .   it   has   the   longer   cord ,   heat   and   blower   controls   and   while   it   has   plenty   of   power   it   doesn   t   blow   quite   as   hard   on   the   low   blower   setting .   since   i   was   having   to   re   learn   the   controls   on   the   t   studio   anyway ,   i   figured   i   might   as   well   get   a   longer   cord   out   of   the   deal .
best   buy   for   19.99   this   is   one   of   the   best   buys   out   there .   wall   mounted   the   cord   and   dryer   are   out   of   the   way   and   off   the   counter .   only   1600   watts   but   dries   better   then   our   bigger   old   one .   small ,   compact   and   you   can   take   it   with   you   when   traveling .
hair   dryer   works   great !   dries   my   hair   with   no   problem   and   my   hair   isn   t   as   frizzy   as   it   usually   is   when   i   blow   dry   it .   haven   t   had   any   problems   with   it   after   the   month   i   ve   had   it .  
great   hair   dryer   with   some   surprising   benefits   i   was   able   to   get   this   directly   from   amazon   for   20 .   i   give   it   5   stars   because   i   think   it   is   a   great   hair   dryer   overall   for   my   purposes ,   and   excellent   also   for   the   price .   i   don   t   use   this   for   travel   but   really   like   the   retractable   cord .   actually   i   don   t   bother   retracting   it ,   but   like   the   fact   that   i   can   keep   just   a   relatively   short   but   usable   length   of   cord   out   all   the   time ,   which   doesn   t   clutter   up   the   counter .   with   every   other   hair   dryer   i   have   ever   had   the   cord   was   way   too   long   and   got   in   the   way .   this   hair   dryer   wouldn   t   be   my   first   choice   for   travel ,   by   the   way ,   because   it   is   a   bit   big   and   heavy   as   compared   to   other   travel   hair   dryers .   at   the   maximum   speed   the   airflow   is   probably   less   than   most   other   dryers ,   but   is   sufficient   for   me .   another   potential   negative   for   some   people   might   be   the   larger   than   normal   handle   circumference ,   but   you   get   used   to   it ,   and   for   me   this   size   is   actually   perfect .   another   surprise   regarding   this   hair   dryer   is   that   my   hair   is   more   shiny   now ,   it   must   be   the   ceramic   or   ionic   thing .   being   ceramic   it   is   supposed   to   have   more   even   heat ,   which   is   less   likely   to   damage   your   hair .   whatever   is   causing   this   effect ,   i   like   it ,   and   was   noticeable   right   away .   lastly   i   am   guessing   this   will   last   a   while ,   given   the   5   year   warranty .   i   previously   was   using   another   20   hair   dryer   purchased   at   a   local   store ,   and   they   lasted   an   average   of   6   months   before   breaking .   this   one   seems   like   it   will   last ,   and   i   won   t   have   any   issues   with   the   cord   retraction   mechanism   possibly   wearing   out   since   i   never   change   the   cord   length .
good   dryer   for   the   money   purchased   this   dryer   after   reading   several   positive   reviews .   i   have   thick ,   curly   hair   that   i   dry   straight   with   a   paddle   brush .   my   hair   is   definitely   softer   and   smoother   i   also   use   a   leave   in   conditioner ,   glossing   gel   and   heat   protecting   spray   .   this   dryer   has   cut   the   time   it   takes   to   dry   my   hair   from   45   mins .   to   25   30   mins .   depending   on   how   damp   my   hair   is   when   i   start   the   only   reason   i   did   not   give   it   a   5   star   rating   is   because   after   the   first   two   weeks   of   using   the   concentrator   tool   on   a   daily   basis   it   no   longer   fits   snug   on   the   dryer .   it   doesn   t   come   off   during   use   but   it   does   rotate   around   and   i   am   constantly   repositioning   it   which   is   a   bit   annoying .   i   ve   only   had   it   for   a   few   months   so   i   can   t   comment   on   it   s   lifespan .   for   the   cost ,   i   wouldn   t   hesitate   to   purchase   another   one   if   the   need   arises .
would   not   buy   again   we   bought   this   hair   dryer   in   oct .   of   2009   and   it   stopped   working   in   may   of   2011 ,   up   to   that   point   it   had   worked   ok .   it   is   small   and   loud   and   did   not   dry   as   well   as   a   normal   size   hair   dryer .   we   would   not   buy   this   product   again .
my   favorite   hair   dryer   this   is   my   second   t3   dryer .   i   have   super   duper   thick   hair   and   i   can   blow   my   hair   in   1   2   of   the   time   of   any   other   hair   dryer .   it   s   fabulous !
elchim   hair   dryer   i   have   purchased   3   of   these   hair   dryers   and   the   last   2   have   not   been   satisfactory !   my   daughter   has   the   original   one   and   it   s   still   going .   i   however ,   purchased   one   the   same   time   she   did   and   it   just   wasn   t   putting   out   the   amount   of   air   it   did   in   the   past .   so   i   replaced   it   with   another   one   and   it   s   only   been   months   and   it   doesn   t   get   as   hot   as   it   used   to .   very   frustrating   to   pay   so   much   for   a   dryer   and   not   have   it   perform .
hair   got   this   for   my   daughter   for   christmas   who   lives   in   another   state   and   she   loves   it ... thanks   for   all   your   good   products .
completely   satisfied   we   wanted   a   wall   mounted   dryer   that   would   fit   a   narrow   space   and   give   us   the   power   for   drying   male   and   female   hair .   this   was   perfect ,   and   it   looks   good ,   too .   only   suggestion   would   be   to   add   a   cool   setting   along   with   its   high   and   low   heat   setting .   we   would   recommend   this   dryer   for   space   savings ,   convenience ,   and   good   looks .
it   works   without   complaints   i   argued   with   my   lady   about   buying   this   hair   dryer .   i   told   her   there   were   others ,   others   less   expensive ,   that   would   do   the   job .   it   is   after   all   just   drying   hair .   after   buying   and   trashing   a   conair   i   finally   bought   her   this   turbo   power   dryer .   the   complants   stopped ,   the   dryer   still   works   and   i   am   her   hero .   the   rewards   were   worth   the   investment .
just   what   i   was   looking   for .   this   hairdryer   was   exactly   what   i   was   looking   for   a   simple   design   that   blows   forcefully .   it   works   quickly   and   my   hair   looks   smooth   when   i   am   done .   the   hottest   setting   gets   a   little   too   hot   if   you   leave   the   dryer   pointed   at   your   scalp   for   more   than   a   few   seconds ,   but   that   s   really   a   pro   because   it   gets   good   and   hot .   it   has   three   heat   settings   to   adjust   for   comfort .
does   the   job !   i   definitely   have   not   had   the   negative   opinion   on   this   dryer   as   other   customers   have   had .   my   natural   hair   has   very   tightly   coiled   curls ,   so   a   normal   dryer   without   a   comb   attachment   only   can   do   so   much .   i   put   the   dryer   on   medium   and   blow   dried   my   hair   in   sections ,   and   it   dried   my   hair   so   fast ,   and   straightened   it   well !   now ,   i   don   t   have   to   deal   with   the   hassle   of   not   being   able   to   comb   through   my   hair   easily .   my   only   dislike   about   the   dryer   is   that   it   is   kind   of   on   the   larger   side ,   and   i   wish   the   attachments   were   so   big   long ,   but   aside   from   that ,   it   works   well   for   me ,   and   saves   me   time   and   frustration !   plus ,   you   can   t   be   the   price !
really   bad   product   after   reading   mixed   reviews   on   this   product   i   decided   to   take   a   chance   since   the   price   seemed   good .   upon   reciept   i   plugged   it   in   and   the   element   overheated   immediately .   the   fan   did   not   work   and   smoke   started   coming   out   of   it .   needless   to   say ,   after   a   long   cool   down   it   went   back   in   the   box   and   was   returned .   amazon   was   great   refunding   my   money   as   i   certainly   didn   t   want   a   replacement .   how   it   got   a   ul   rating   i   ll   never   know .   i   suggest   spending   a   few   more   bucks   and   getting   a   quality   item .
dries   hair   real   quick   i   suggest   you   don   t   waste   your   cash   on   those   expensive   hair   dryers   when   you   can   buy   this   one .   it   comes   in   the   ceramic   tourmaline   design   that   is   popular   now ,   but   more   importantly ,   this   dryer   s   wattage   is   much   higher   than   most   hair   dryers   out   there   and   i   ve   looked !   .   the   higher   the   wattage ,   the   more   air   it   can   move   around ... and   that   means   faster   dry   times .   i   ve   only   used   this   a   couple   of   times ,   so   i   don   t   know   how   long   it   will   last .   so   far ,   so   good .
a   great   traveler !   this   compact   styler   is   fabulous .   it   folds   up   nicely   so   it   takes   up   very   little   space .   it   has   traveled   throughout   europe   and   the   mediterranean   with   us   and   has   never   been   a   disappointment .
hair   dryer   i   got   the   first   one   good   so   i   order   the   second   one . i   m   happy   with   it . it   s   very   organized . my   kid   love   it   too .
less   clutter   this   is   great .   used   them   in   hotels   in   the   past .   convenient ,   always   know   where   it   is   and   it   works   great .
great   blow   dryer !   i   absolutely   love   this   hair   dryer .   it   makes   my   hair   so   shiny   and   soft ,   and   it   feels   incredibly   smooth .   with   other   hair   dryers ,   my   hair   would   look   fried ,   frizzy ,   and   extremely   coarse ,   no   matter   what   products   i   used .   not   with   this   one !   it   has   a   decent   amount   of   settings   available   temperature   settings   are   hot   and   warm   and   speed   settings   are   low   and   high .   the   cool   shot   button   is   great   for   locking   in   the   shine   and   shape   in   my   hairstyle .   it   s   easy   to   use   this   hair   dryer ,   and   it   s   not   so   heavy ,   which   is   nice .
impressed !   i   am   seriously   impressed .   next   to   laundry ,   blow   drying   my   hair   is   my   least   favorite   thing   to   do .   i   was   looking   for   something   that   would   blow   dry   my   hair   fast .   i   have   very   fine   hair ,   longer   than   shoulder   length .   the   first   day   i   used   this   blow   dryer   i   had   it   on   medium   heat   and   it   took   10   minutes .   that   is   how   long   my   old   blow   dryer   took ,   but   my   hair   looked   much   healthier   than   with   other   blow   dryers .   the   next   day   i   used   it ,   i   set   it   to   hot   and   it   took   only   5   minutes !   it   still   looked   great ,   just   as   healthy !   my   hair   is   always   breaking   and   when   i   blow   dry ,   normally   the   damage   is   very   apparent .   with   this   blow   dryer   my   hair   looks   smooth   and   shiny !   i   love   this   blow   dryer .   i   highly   recommended   it ! !
if   you   need   one   i   don   t   really   like   hair   dryers   because   of   the   noise   factor   and   the   energy   use ,   however   sometimes   i   need   one .   i   used   this   one   at   my   place   of   employment   i   teach   water   classes   and   found   it   does   the   job .   it   is   small   enough   to   travel   easily .
just   the   right   speed   and   temperature   i   already   owned   this   blow   dryer ,   but   purchased   a   second   one   for   travel .   i   really   like   this   dryer   for   it   s   ease   of   use ,   temperature   and   air   settings .   i   like   that   the   operating   buttons   are   a   slide   up   and   down .   this   is   a   great   feature   since   you   don   t   accidentally   turn   the   blow   dryer   off   or   change   the   settings   while   you   are   drying   your   hair ,   like   other   dryers   with   elevated   buttons .   i   have   a   lot   of   hair   and   it   s   thick   and   this   blow   dryer ,   drys   it   very   quickly .   the   heat   is   not   overly   hot ,   it   s   just   right !   the   lower   settings   are   perfect   for   styling .   the   dryer   is   also   light   weight .   the   price   is   lower   than   anywhere   else   and   it   arrived   quickly   and   no   shipping !
excellent   purchase   experience .   i   ordered   and   received   my   merchandise   exactly   as   promised .   no   muse   and   no   fuse .   just   a   perfect   buying   experience .   i   would   recommend   this   vendor .
great !   wow   so   lightweight .   it   s   unbelievably   efficient .   if   it   only   had   a   cool   setting   it   would   be   perfect .   br   still   it   comes   close .   great   price .
life   is   too   short   this   is   an   awesome   dryer !   my   hair   stylist   recommended   it   as   it   is   the   same   line   used   in   her   salon .   very   effective   and   cuts   down   the   time   required   for   drying   in   half .   could   never   go   back   now   that   i   know   what   a   better   dryer   feels   like .
strongly   recommend   this   dryer   definitely   lives   up   to   its   claims .   as   an   african   american   who   has   natural   hair ,   i   was   looking   for   a   product   that   would   not   dry   out   my   hair .   the   technology   of   this   dryer   not   only   dries   my   hair   quickly ,   but   also   leaves   it   hydrated   with   lots   of   moisture .   i   use   this   for   my   daughter   s   hair   as   well ,   who   has   thick ,   coarse   hair .   this   dryer   also   provides   moisture   and   helps   with   the   manageability   of   her   hair .   i   strongly   recommend   this   product .
great   hair   dryer   i   first   found   this   hair   dryer   while   staying   at   mariott   hotel   and   loved   it .   i   always   bring   my   own   with   me   on   trips   but   this   time   i   never   used   it .   great   power   yet   small   and   with   the   retractable   cord   very   easy   to   store .
way   too   small   in   size   this   thing   is   way   to   small   to   be   useful .   if   it   were   a   portable ,   perhaps ,   but   this   is   a   wall   mount !   it   s   like   a   mini   hand   dryer .   returned   it   immediately   after   receiving   it .
great   hair   dryer !   this   is   a   great   little   hair   dryer .   i   wanted   a   hair   dryer   to   use   for   both   home   travel   and   the   size   is   perfect .
did   not   like   this   dryer   at   all !   i   bought   this   dryer   about   a   year   ago   at   target   becuase   i   was   looking   for   a   dryer   with   a   diffuser .   the   first   time   i   tried   it ,   it   was   very   difficult   to   turn   on   becuase   of   the   flat   switches ,   which   are   pretty   stiff ,   and   the   texture   they   have   on   them   doesn   t   help   you   grip   them   at   all .   and   it   takes   forever   to   dry   your   hair   with   it   becuase   it   doesn   t   seem   to   get   all   that   hot .   the   folding   handle   and   retractable   cord   work   just   fine ,   very   nice   for   storage ,   and   yes   the   cord   doesn   t   really   fully   retract   after   the   first   time   you   use   it ,   you   re   left   with   about   2   inches   of   cord   sticking   out .   i   definitely   would   not   recommend   this   hair   dryer .   the   only   reason   i   can   t   bring   myself   to   throw   it   out   is   because   it   technically   still   works   and   i   ll   at   least   have   some   hair   dryer   in   case   my   good   one   breaks .
pretty   disappointing   i   used   this   type   of   dryer   at   my   brother   s   house   and   recall   it   feeling   powerful   and   pretty   hot ,   even   at   a   low   setting   exactly   what   i   was   looking   for   in   a   new   dryer .   then   i   ordered   one   for   myself   and   got   a   fairly   crappy   dryer   that   didn   t   get   warm   enough   at   a   low   speed   setting   and   didn   t   feel   powerful   at   all ...   my   only   impression   is   disappointment .   i   would   not   recommend   this   dryer   for   anyone   looking   for   a   quality   dryer .
not   good   for   fine   hair   i   have   super   long   fine   hair   and   this   didn   t   do   it   for   me .   it   actually   made   my   hair   feel   sticky ,   for   lack   of   a   better   word .   it   is   much   louder   than   any   other   dryer   i   ve   used   and   it   didn   t   come   with   the   concentrator   as   advertised ...   i   ll   be   sending   it   back .
virgin   hair   dryer   purchaser ... love   it !   after   years   of   having   a   long   magnificent   mane ... i   decided   that   perhaps   the   bare   minimum   for   the   curls   wasn   t   enough .   i   love   this   hair   dryer ... i   have   nearly   more   long ,   curly   hair   than   shakira   herself ... and   this   dryer   does   the   job   very   well   on   the   low   setting   and   quickly !   i   recommend   the   tresemme   flawless   curls   defining   gel   if   you   have   thick   curly   hair   and   need   a   great   dryer   with   a   fantastic   diffuser !   the   salon   quality   at   an   affordable   price   with   a   solid   diffuser   that   wouldn   t   lose   grip   on   the   dryer   is   what   i   sought ,   and   it   s   exactly   what   i   got !
best   hairdryer   ever ! ! ! !   this   is   a   great   hairdryer .   i   have   a   full   sized   one   for   home   and   it   dries   my   hair   in   less   than   2   minutes   and   i   have   long   hair .   it   leaves   hair   smooth   and   silky   and   has   not   damaged   it   at   all .   i   bought   this   one   to   put   in   my   gym   bag   and   i   was   worried   that   it   wouldn   t   work   as   well   as   the   full   sized   version .   i   highly   recommend   this   hair   dryer !
hard   hat   dryer   1061   i   liked   the   dryer ,   i   have   thick   hair   so   it   usually   takes   forever   to   dry .   the   only   complaint   i   have ,   i   wish   the   hard   hat   could   be   used   to   lower   the   dryer   rather   than   the   arm   its   attached   to .
good   buy   this   is   the   second   conair   silver   bird   hair   dryer   that   i   have   purchased .   i   like   it   very   much ,   except   that   its   a   bit   heavy .   it   works   great   and   is   powerful   enough   to   dry   any   hair   type .
great   for   the   price   great   blowdryer   for   the   price ,   has   three   settings ,   is   definitley   an   improvement   over   my   old   dryer .   im   not   sure   if   this   gets   as   hot   as   i   would   like ,   but   for   the   price ,   i   am   very   satisfied .
hair   dryer   this   product   should   have   come   with   a   warning .   even   on   the   low   setting ,   one   can   get   a   third   degree   burn   from   the   heat .
love   it !   getting   another   for   my   mom   sister !   love   how   lightweight   compact   this   blow   dryer   is !   air   concentration   is   great   due   to   style   shape   of   the   nozzle !   easy   to   travel   with   drys   great !   it   is   more   powerful   drys   better   than   other   higher   watt   blow   dryers   i   ve   owned   in   the   past .   would   highly   recommend   this   product   already   have   !
the   best !   i   had   one   of   them   for   more   than   14   years , but   because   it   was   quite   old   start   acting   funny .   still   work ,   but   sometimes   didn   t   want   to   turn   off .   so ,   i   bought   an   expensive   one   from   a   retail   store   and   it   was   junk ,   i   change   that   blow   dryer   twice   in   a   year .   then   i   decide   to   look   here   to   see   if   i   find   my   turbo   dryer   and   lucky   enough   i   did .   i   love   this   blow   dryer   is   the   best .   i   have   long   hair   and   i   like   my   hair   super   straight   and   the   turbo   1500   do   the   magic   super   easy .
horrible   noise   i   don   t   personally   use   this   unit ,   but   my   girlfriend   does   every   morning ,   and   it   causes   a   huge   degradation   of   my   quality   of   life   in   the   mornings .   it   initially   doesn   t   sound   all   that   loud ,   but   over   time   the   high   pitch   squeal   that   it   makes   will   start   to   drive   you   nuts .   i   don   t   think   she   necessarily   hears   it   as   the   sound   exits   through   the   back   of   the   unit   away   from   her ,   and   i   bear   the   brunt   of   the   unpleasant   noise .   anyway   i   cannot   recommend   having   one   of   these   in   your   home   if   you   live   with   other   people .   i   figured   it   s   worth   warning   other   people ,   so   i   made   a   quick   stop   to   comment   before   shopping   for   a   replacement   so   i   can   get   back   to   relaxed   mornings .
awesome   blower !   i   ordered   this   on   amazon   from   elephant   deals .   i   received   it   quickly .   the   blower   is   fantastic .   it   has   a   steady ,   hot   flow .   it   doesn   t   leave   me   with   flyaways ,   and   i   don   t   have   to   use   a   flat   iron   when   i   m   done .   it   is   quick   and   efficient .   i   highly   recommend   this   blower .
lives   up   to   expectations   as   i   had   minimal   space   on   our   bathroom   counter   i   needed   a   hair   dryer   that   could   hang   out   of   the   way .   i   was   able   to   attach   it   to   the   inside   of   the   cabinet   door   below .   thus   it   is   out   of   sight   when   not   in   use   and   very   available   when   needed .   as   far   as   the   function   of   the   dryer ,   it   lives   up   to   my   expectations .
great   wall   hairdryer   this   replaced   my   old   wall   hairdryer .   i   love   the   design   and   the   night   light   is   very   nice   to   have .   very   quiet   when   running   and   i   have   the   option   of   changing   from   1200w   to   1600w .   i   would   recommend   this   hairdryer .
hottools   salon   dryer   not   up   to   par   the   hot   tools   salon   dryer   does   not   have   enough   power   to   actually   dry   your   hair .   the   dome   doesn   t   fit   around   your   head   or   my   head   like   it   does   at   the   salon .   the   combination   of   the   size   of   the   device   as   well   as   the   lack   of   heat   that   it   blows   out ,   make   this   a   bad   purchase .   i   do   not   recommend   and   i   will   be   returning   it .
love   this   dryer   i   have   had   my   dryer   for   over   a   year   now   and   have   had   no   problems   with   it .   it   works   as   well   now   as   it   did   when   i   received   it .   it   is   not   too   noisy   and   it   is   light   weight   enough   for   me   i   hate   a   heavy   dryer   .   it   is   a   full   size   dryer   ,   not   a   travel   size ,   and   it   dries   my   hair   quickly .   i   like   that   it   has   2   blow   settings   and   3   heat   settings .   it   is   easy   to   change   settings   while   drying .   i   use   it   everyday .... so   it   has   had   a   real   workout ..
shorted   out   after   4   years   4   months .   i   purchased   this   blackbird   in   december   of   2006   and   now   in   april   of   2011   smoke   started   coming   out   of   the   on   off   switch ,   so   i   got   a   good   4   years   out   of   it .   in   this   day   and   age   when   this   product   like   others   offer   no   warranty   time   at   all   i   quess   thats   pretty   good .
could   do   better   in   this   price   range   i   ve   had   this   hair   dryer   for   a   while   and   the   biggest   issue   i   have   with   it   is   that   regardless   of   the   heat   setting ,   it   dries   out   my   hair .   badly .   also ,   the   attachments   have   a   tendency   to   fall   off   which   is   a   problem   when   you   re   mid   drying   and   it   s   too   hot   to   put   back   on .   i   m   finally   getting   around   to   replacing   it   so   that   my   hair   stops   getting   damaged !
great   dryer   for   the   money   overall ,   love   the   dryer .   i   do   wish   there   was   a   hook   for   hanging   and   ultimately   would   love   to   see   a   medium   heat   setting .   the   dryer   really   does   make   my   hair   shine !   good   deal   for   the   cost   and   the   retractable   cord   is   a   a   lifesaver .
poor   wall   mount   system   i   would   not   recommend   this   item ,   the   wall   mounting   system   is   poor .   the   screws   utilized   to   mount   dryer   to   the   wall   bracket   failed   on   the   first   turn .   additionally ,   the   night   light   stopped   working   after   1   day .
thank   you   allure   i   went   thru   a   couple   dryers   before   finally   finding   this   one .   i   wanted   quiet ,   cord   reel ,   high   power ,   and   high   heat .   what   i   did   not   want   is   hot   pink   i   hate   pink .   what   swayed   me   was   that   it   won   an   award   from   allure   magazine   as   being   the   best .   thank   you   allure .   didn   t   realize   how   difficult   it   is   to   get   a   dryer   that   would   meet   all   my   requirements .   totally   excellent   dryer .   just   wish   they   would   make   it   in   a   neutral   color   like   silver   or   black .
not   worth   the   money .   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   when   i   decided   to   replace   my   still   working ,   but   not   doing   the   best   job ,   conair .   i   am   a   sucker   for   anything   different ,   and   this   fit   the   bill .   i   washed   my   hair   right   after   i   bought   it   so   i   could   check   it   out .   after   using   it   all   i   could   think   of   were   these   three   words   no   me   gusta .   i   didn   t   even   finish   drying   my   hair   with   it ,   my   conair   takes   me   5   minutes   tops   to   dry   my   thick ,   shoulder   length   hair .   i   was   on   20   minutes   with   this   one   and   i   had   had   enough .   also ,   it   kept   sucking   my   hair   into   the   vents   which   was   rather   painful .   this   hair   dryer   is   severely   lacking   oomph .   it   takes   me   less   time   to   dry   my   hair   with   my   old   conair   and   style   separately   then   it   would   have   taken   me   to   style   and   dry   with   this   thing .   i   am   returning   it   tomorrow   and   i   ll   buy   a   regular   blow   dryer .   once   again ,   no   me   gusta .
bepoke   t3   tourmaline   special   edition   this   is   my   third   t3 .   the   special   edition   comes   with   a   shorter   cord .   this   is   fine   for   home   use   in   fact ,   it   might   be   better   not   having   and   8   ft   cord .   this   blow   dryer   is   the   best   i   have   ever   used   and   the   price   is   less   that   inferior   dryers .
not   good   let   me   start   by   saying   i   replaced   this   dryer   within   2   weeks   of   use   because   i   could   see   the   damage   to   my   hair .   the   only   reason   i   gave   it   2   stars   instead   of   1   is   because   it   does   dry   fairly   quickly .   it   is   much   louder   that   my   last   dryer .   the   power   switch   is   difficult   to   move .   some   mornings   it   wouldn   t   turn   on   until   i   put   the   retractable   cord   in   and   out   a   few   times .   the   worst   downfall   is   the   damage   to   my   hair   though .   after   2   weeks   of   use ,   i   started   to   notice   split   ends   and   dry   fly   aways .   not   good   at   all .... do   not   buy .
this   hairdryer   is   amazing !   my   hair   is   so   soft   and   it   was   so   worth   the   money .   i   recommend   it   for   anyone   also   great   gift   idea   update   i   have   had   this   item   since   2011   and   its   still   going   strong !
enjoying   it   so   far   nice   quality ,   you   get   what   you   pay   for .   it   s   efficient   and   the   temperature   options   as   nice .   i   use   the   diffuser   all   the   time   for   my   curly   hair   to   avoid   frizzing   and   it   locks   on   nicely .   also ,   the   diffuser   is   nicely   shaped   so   you   can   get   it   right   on   your   scalp   because   it   is   curved ,   and   it   won   t   fall   off   all   the   time   like   it   might   with   another   brand .   make   sure   you   don   t   click   the   blue   button   unless   you   want   it   locked   on   the   cold   temperature   i   almost   thought   i   had   a   defective   product   because   i   didn   t   know   i   had   clicked   it   by   accident .   otherwise   it   s   working   great   so   far .

perfect !   my   10   year   old   conair   just   died   so   i   bought   this   model .   so   far   it   has   been   perfect .   the   airflow   is   great .   i   love   the   temperature   settings   with   the   cool   shot .   i   mainly   use   the   straightening   attachment   which   is   perfect .   this   works   just   as   well   as   the   150   ones   at   the   salon .
can   t   live   without   it .   i   have   owned   a   t3   hairdryer   for   over   7   years   now .   the   first   model   i   owned   was   the   evolution   model   300   retail   and   used   it   for   5   years .   i   still   have   it   and   it   works .   i   replaced   it   with   the   feather   weight   model   only   because   i   had   back   surgery   and   the   evolution   was   a   little   heavy   to   hold   over   the   top   of   my   head   for   any   length   of   time ,   so   i   switched .   the   feather   weight   is   an   excellent   hairdryer   my   hair   is   extremely   thick   and   curly .   this   dryer   dries   it   from   completely   wet   to   dry ,   smooth   and   straight   in   12   minutes   and   i   have   a   lot   of   hair .   i   recommend   using   the   attachment   to   concentrate   the   airflow   exactly   where   you   want   it .   i   only   take   the   attachment   off   when   i   want   to   simply   blow   the   water   out   of   my   hair   before   styling   it   then   i   put   the   attachment   back   on .   don   t   hesitate   especially   if   you   have   unruly ,   curly ,   thick   hair   that   takes   a   long   time   to   dry .   this   one   shortens   the   time ,   smooths   the   hair   shaft ,   and   straightens   great .   i   also   use   john   frieda   products   especially   the   hairspray   for   curly   hair   as   well   the   hairspray   will   keep   your   hair   straight   for   one   day   and   that   is   a   true   fact !
travel   perfect   if   you   travel   and   would   like   to   style   your   hair   at   your   destination   then   the   infinitipro   by   conair   1875   is   for   you .   the   foldable   handle   is   perhaps   the   best   invention   since   the   invention   of   the   blow   dryer   itself .   when   folded   it   fits   into   its   own   carrier   bag .   that   bag   fits   easily   in   any   suitcase   or   briefcase   or   purse   if   you   carry   one   .   the   portability   of   this   styler   should   not   fool   you   as   you   have   a   full   1875   watts .   that   s   a   lot   of   power   to   blow   and   to   heat !   i   would   highly   recommend   this   styler .   oh ,   and   i   forgot   to   mention   that   the   color   looks   great !
solid   basic   hair   dryer   this   is   a   basic   hair   dryer .   the   feature   differentiates   it   from   other   competitors   is   the   twist   folding   handle .   the   power   is   1875   watt .   it   is   quite   decent ,   but   most   of   the   hair   dryers   have   that   same   power .   it   may   be   because   the   same   ac   motor   is   sued .   it   has   two   heat   settings   with   a   button   to   blow   air   only .   the   ceramic   technology   is   also   in   other   hair   dryers .   all   in   all ,   this   is   a   basic   solid   hair   dryer .   if   you   are   not   crazy   about   the   folding   handle ,   you   can   go   for   the   competitors   at   a   slightly   lower   price .
best   hair   dryer   ever !   this   hair   dryer   shaved   1   1   2   hours   off   my   hair   straightening   time .   i   have   curly   or   better   yet   coily   hair   and   this   hair   dryer   with   the   comb   attachment   goes   through   it   like   butter !   i   highly   recommend   this   hair   dryer !
powerful   yet   compact !   this   hair   dryer   is   powerful .   it   dries   hair   much   faster   than   my   old   trusty   dryer .   the   swivel   handle   can   be   folded   so   that   the   whole   thing   can   go   into   a   small   tote   for   travel   or   storage .   besides   the   standard   high   and   low   settings ,   it   has   a   cool   shot   button   to   just   dry   hair   without   heat .   it   is   very   well   built   and   has   a   very   high   quality   feel   to   it .   no   wonder   it   is   backed   by   a   4   year   warranty !   besides   a   tote   bag ,   it   comes   with   snap   on   concentrator   for   special   styling   needs .   the   metallic   apple   green   color   is   just   too   hot .   with   its   modern   style   setting   look ,   it   is   just   adorable .   love   it !
really   nice   hair   dryer   this   is   my   second   andis   hair   dryer .   i   had   the   first   one   over   six   years   but   it   was   starting   to   wear   out .   i   wanted   to   stay   with   this   brand   and   this   one   is   even   better .   lightweight   and   easy   to   hold .   i   like   the   three   heat   settings   which   the   older   one   did   not   have .   more   important ,   styling   is   better   and   my   hair   really   does   feel   silkier   and   looks   shinier .   i   recommend   this   product .
remington   ac2015   tstudio   salon   collection   pearl   ceramic   hair   dryer   this   review   is   for   the   remington   ac2015   tstudio   salon   collection   pearl   ceramic   hair   dryer .   the   packaging   of   this   product   was   nicely   done   and   not   too   wasteful ,   but   adequate   enough   to   get   the   contents   delivered   without   being   broken   or   damaged .   the   product   was   easy   to   remove   from   the   packaging ,   and   the   instructions   for   use   were   very   straightforward   and   well   written .   the   temperature   controls   and   blower   settings   were   intuitive ,   and   the   balance   of   heating   and   air   movement   seems   to   be   very   suitable .   overall ,   i   was   very   pleased   with   the   quality   of   this   product .
powerful   and   quieter   than   most .   when   turned   on   this   blow   dryer   sounds   different   than   any   other   i   have   previously   owned .   it   sound   stronger ,   with   a   quieter   engine   hum .   the   color   is   very   cool   and   i   like   the   turn   and   fold   handle .   the   cord   is   durable   and   the   settings   are   nice .   the   warm   setting   is   just   right   and   i   like   the   cool   down   set   style   setting .   it   is   full   size ,   but   not   overly   big   and   thus   it   is   easy   to   handle   and   not   tiresome   to   use .   highly   recommend   this   blow   dryer !
disappointing   i   had   high   expectations   for   this   hair   dryer   and   i   am   deceived .   i   bought   it   to   replace   my   babyliss   hair   dryer   dropped   it   too   many   times ...   and   preferred   the   babyliss .   this   fhi   hair   dryer   is   a   bit   heavy ,   and   it   didn   t   make   my   hair   shiny   and   soft   at   all .   it   didn   t   even   dry   my   hair   faster   than   babyliss ,   but   i   have   to   say   i   didn   t   try   it   on   at   the   highest   setting ,   cause   it   looked   to   me   wayyyyy   too   hot   for   my   hair   to   handle   without   major   damage .   i   guess   i   ll   get   used   to   it ,   but   i   wouldn   t   recommend   someone   else   to   buy   it ,   not   worth   the   price .
dont   buy   do   not   buy   this   dryer   it   will   stop   working   in   3   months   i   used   this   dry   proberbly   3   times   in   3   months   and   it   just   stop   working   and   you   have   to   have   the   recipt   to   return   it   is   just   not   worth   it   plus   the   heat   come   from   one   direction   and   you   have   to   move   you   head   so   that   ever   were   can   dry   skip   it   theirs   a   reason   its   priced   so   cheap
lightweight ,   good   power   i   ve   used   a   blow   dryer   practically   every   day   for   the   past   30   years   so   i   consider   myself   a   bit   of   an   expert .   this   is   one   of   the   best   blow   dryers   i   ve   used .   it   s   light   but   powerful   and   does   a   great   job .   highly   recommended .
very   nice   i   like   the   hair   dryer .   it   dries   very   well   and   the   design   is   very   modern   and   updated .   it   is   adjustable   and   it   get   really   hot   with   and   it   has   a   ionic   straightener   that   helps   your   hair   dry   you   hair   straight .
great   but   bullky   it   could   be   me ,   but   i   am   used   to   a   much   smaller   hair   dryer .   this   felt   just   a   little   bulky   for   me .   also   the   attachment   seems   useless .   a   comb   would   have   been   far   more   appropriate .   with   that   said ,   it   works   like   a   charm !   the   temperature   switch   could   have   been   better   placed   as   well ,   it   wobbles   for   some   odd   reason   and   the   cooling   button   is   directly   were   you   would   place   you   hand .   just   seems   weird .   but   the   heat   is   great !   i   have   very   thick   hair ,   this   dryer   got   the   job   done .   for   the   price   you   cant   beat   it !
very   dangerous   i   purchased   this   dryer   about   6   months   ago ,   and   today   when   i   was   using   it   it   started   shooting   out   sparks .   i   looked   it   up   on   google   and   this   has   happened   to   a   lot   of   people .   it   s   even   started   shooting   out   flames   and   caused   house   fires   when   it   s   just   plugged   in   and   not   even   turned   on .   just   don   t   buy   it ,   its   dangerous .
exactly   what   i   was   looking   for   after   having   used   a   wall   mount   sunbeam   hairdryer   on   vacation   last   summer ,   i   really   wanted   one   for   my   bathroom .   after   researching   many   available   on   amazon   and   other   websites ,   i   chose   the   andis   model   because   it   offered   the   nighlight   and   a   place   for   the   cord .   i   ve   been   using   it   now   for   two   months .   since   it   was   going   to   take   up   a   permanent   spot   in   my   outlet ,   it   having   a   nightlight   was   dead   useful .   i   read   other   reviews   saying   that   the   nightlight   was   way   too   bright .   my   husband   and   i   disagree .   we   love   the   amount   of   light   put   out   by   the   hairdryer .   it   is   signficantly   brighter   than   our   old   nightlight   which   means   you   can   get   up   in   the   middle   of   the   night   to   use   the   bathroom   and   never   have   to   turn   on   the   overhead   light .   isn   t   that   the   point   of   a   nightlight   maybe   the   people   who   dislike   the   amount   of   light   have   it   in   a   master   bath   and   don   t   close   the   door   to   the   bathroom   and   it   bothers   them   when   they   sleep   my   solution   would   be   to   shut   the   bathroom   door   in   that   case !   sorry   that   this   turned   into   a   review   of   the   nightlight   feature !   the   hairdryer   gives   you   as   1400   or   1600   watt   option   and   i   use   it   on   the   1600   because   i   have   massively   thick   hair .   it   dries   my   hair   quickly   and   is   not   obnoxiously   loud .   i   like   that   it   has   a   cord   keeper   and   keeps   everything   tidy   in   my   teeny   bathroom .   my   husband   had   the   hairdryer   mounted   on   the   wall   in   less   than   10   minutes   and   that   includes   my   running   up   and   down   the   stairs   for   the   right   screwdriver .   all   in   all ,   an   excellent   buy   and   i   would   purchase   it   again .
dryes   quickly   but   super   loud !   bought   this   for   my   mom   to   try   it   out   because   her   150   dryer   went   out   after   9years   and   she   said   it   dryes   almost   as   quickly   as   her   old   one   but   is   super   loud !   and   does   not   leave   hair   feeling   or   looking   as   smooth   and   shiny   as   her   old   one .   you   get   what   you   pay   for .
great   hair   dryer   my   first   jerdon   hair   dryer   lasted   10   years   and   we   used   it   every   day .   i   bought   another   brand ,   and   it   lasted   less   than   a   year .   i   just   purchased   another   jerdon   hair   dryer   and   i   see   why   i   bought   it   in   the   first   place .   it   is   a   terrific   hair   dryer !   i   will   buy   no   other .
dries   quickly   but   is   loud   got   this   jerdon   from   amazon   to   replace   an   oster   with   the   same   wattage .   this   dryer   seems   to   dry   my   hair   a   lot   faster ,   but ...... when   doing   the   sides ,   it   sounds   like   a   jet   airplane .   it   is   very   noisy ,   but   you   don   t   have   to   have   it   on   as   long ,   so   i   guess   it   evens   out   the   pros   and   the   cons .   i   would   recommend   this   to   a   friend ,   but ,   i   would   advise   them   about   the   loudness   of   the   dryer .   it   is   a   good   dryer   for   the   cost   and   i   am   not   sorry   i   bought   it .
awesome   i   first   saw   this   product   at   my   hairdresser   s   salon   while   she   was   blowing   drying   my   daughter   s   hair .   this   product   was   wonderful .   it   made   her   hair   soft   and   light   and   dried   her   hair   within   minutes .   it   also   straightens   the   hair   which   my   daughter   loves   as   her   hair   is   natural .   i   also   tried   it   on   my   relaxed   hair   and   it   did   the   same   thing .   awesome   product .
doesn   t   do   what   it   says   the   retractible   cord   and   the   ionic   technology   were   the   selling   points   for   me .   the   box   reads   provides   maximum   hair   conditioning   ions   for   smooth ,   frizz   free   hair .   not   true .   my   hair   is   curly   and   the   ionic   technology   usually   does   the   trick   on   managing   dryer   frizz .   however ,   this   is   not   the   case   with   this   hair   dryer .   i   have   come   to   the   conclusion   that   the   concentrator   attachment   is   the   problem .   it   has   holes   on   both   sides   that   allow   escape   of   air ,   and   i   can   t   think   of   any   other   reason   than   this   to   explain   the   frizz .   i   bought   a   conair   ionic   as   well ,   with   the   same   type   of   concentrator ,   causing   the   same   issue   with   my   hair .   my   previous   dryer   gave   me   the   results   that   i   like ,   and   there   were   no   holes   in   the   concentrator .   the   hunt   continues ...
terrible   product   i   bought   this   product   based   on   customer   reviews .   it   would   impossible   to   overstate   the   poor   quality   of   this   product .   doesn   t   dry   hair   effectively .   hood   is   so   high   you   need   to   sit   on   a   stool .   the   mechanism   for   adjusting   the   height   is   extremely   difficult   to   use ... and   still   doesn   t   get   it   low   enough   to   not   have   to   sit   on   a   stool   or   very   high   chair .   there   are   no   air   drying   vents   on   the   sides   of   the   hood .   top   of   the   head   gets   all   the   heat .   poor   investment .   we   had   to   return .
ionic   heat   this   product   does   justice   to   those   who   have   thick ,   full   hair   to   even   silky   fine   hair .   i   have   used   several   blow   dryers   and   this   one   has   help   protect   breakage ,   it   s   easy   to   use   and   to   store ,   and   eliminates   me   from   oiling   or   heating   my   hair   as   much   without   it   s   ionic   ceramic   support .   the   heat   and   wattage   combined   helps   keep   my   hair   shiny ,   healthy   and   straight .   less   use   of   flat   iron   and   pressing   comb !   i   m   a   satisfied   customer !  
not   happy   i   ordered   the   t3bespoke   labs   hair   dryer   in   2010   within   one   year   dryer   stopped   working   contacted   discount   jungle   and   was   told   to   email   dryer   back   for   replacement   had   to   call   several   times   and   was   told   my   dryer   would   be   mailed   out   shortly   or   was   on   the   way   one   call   was   answered   with   it   is   no   longer   under   warrenty   broken   dryer   mailed   back   to   me   with   no   explanation   i   am   not   happy   with   this   company   and   would   not   order   from   them   again   i   am   now   finding   out   they   are   an   unauthorized   dealer   for   the   hairdryer
loved   it ,   then   it   died .   had   for   less   than   a   month   before   it   died .   loved   the   size ,   retractable   cord ,   folding   ability .   it   s   a   bit   heavy   for   a   travel   dryer ,   but   i   didn   t   buy   it   for   that .... just   it   s   compact   size   and   retractable   cord .   it   just   stopped   working   less   than   a   month   after   receiving ! ! ! !
loud ,   shrill ,   unbearable   to   use ...   i   got   this   to   replace   another   conair   dryer   that   i   loved .   i   wish   they   would   stick   with   their   old   way   of   doing   things   instead   of   improving .   it   isn   t   as   kind   to   my   hair   while   drying   and   is   too   painful   to   my   ears .   am   returning   it .
great   travel   styler   my   wife   with   her   beautiful   long   hair   always   uses   a   blow   dryer   after   washing   it .   so   this   works   perfect   for   the   always   have   with   you   styler .   it   works   great ,   looks   great   and   the   handle   folds   up   nicely   to   make   it   compact .   the   lint   catcher   is   detachable   to   easily   clean   off   the   lint   and   it   also   comes   with   a   bag   which   helps   keep   the   cord   with   the   unit .   excellent   styler   and   works   great   on   my   short   hair ,   too !
easy   to   install   i   ve   only   had   the   product   a   short   time   and   purchased   it   to   install   in   my   guest   bathroom .   i   had   a   guest   visiting   from   england   for   three   weeks   and   she   loved   it !   she   said   it   was   better   than   most   she   has   encountered   in   1st   class   hotels .   i   m   surprised   how   quiet   it   is .
almost   not   quite   i   wanted   something   basic ,   relatively   inexpensive ,   reasonably   well   made ,   and   sturdy   that   would   dry   and   style   my   hair   quickly .   that   is   almost   exactly   what   i   got .   my   only   real   issues   with   the   dryer   is   the   flimsy   switch   and   lint   trap   cover .   the   switch   doesn   t   click   into   a   new   setting   crisply .   you   have   to   go   slowly   and   gently   with   the   switch   control   in   order   to   get   any   setting   other   than   off   or   the   highest   heat   fan   position .   the   lint   trap   cover   just   pops   off   and   takes   some   careful   fussing   around   to   replace   securely .   sometimes   even   if   you   think   you   have   it   back   on   correctly   it   will   pop   back   off   a   few   seconds   later .
junk   i   bought   the   silver   colored   version   of   this   at   target   about   5   months   ago .   i   was   happy   with   it   until   last   week .   i   straightened   the   collasable   handle   and   heard   a   cracking   sound .   the   handle   would   no   longer   stay   straight   when   i   used   the   machine .   like   some   of   the   other   reviewers   i   found ,   upon   opening   up   the   device ,   that   the   very   cheap   plastic   piece   that   kept   the   handle   in   the   locked   position   had   broken .   there   was   no   way   to   fix   it   and   it   wasn   t   worth   the   hassle   and   expense   to   mail   it   in   for   repair .   so   i   bought   a   different   brand   last   night .   i   m   very   unhappy   with   this   product .
frizzy   hair   now   straight !   i   have   pretty   frizzy   hair ,   i   get   it   chemically   straightened ,   but   still ,   when   i   blow   dry   it ,   it   s   frizzy   i   need   to   flat   iron   it .   i   was   amazed   by   this   hair   dryer !   i   used   the   comb   attachment   after   drying   my   hair   it   looked   like   it   had   already   been   flat   ironed ! ! !   it   was   straight   shiny .   i   would   highly   recommend   this   hair   dryer   to   anyone   with   curly   hair   that   wants   it   straight !
a   goo   replacement   i   had   a   conair   from   years   ago   that   was   on   its   way   out   so   i   decided   to   buy   another   one .   it   is   very   efficient   and   powerful   and   i   love   the   cord   keeper   feature .   i   thought   the   opening   was   a   little   larger ,   but   other   than   that ,   so   far   so   good .
not   the   usual   hotel   hair   dryer   i   ordered   the   andis   based   on   the   two   speeds ,   cord   holder ,   and   night   light .   after   installing ,   i   wanted   the   higher   1600   w   and   you   need   a   screwdriver   to   change   the   speeds .   this   is   very   inconvenient .   after   finishing   the   change   and   using ,   the   cord   stretched   out   and   didn   t   return   to   it   s   compact   size , leading   me   to   think   that   s   why   they   may   have   put   the   little   knob   on   the   side .   the   night   light   is   a   nice   feature .   i   am   disappointed   with   the   look   of   the   stretched   out   cord .   i   will ,   leave   the   dryer   on   the   high   speed   as   it   makes   no   sense   to   keep   changing   the   intensity .   yes ,   it   s   quiet .   priced   reasonably .
it   s   exactly   what   i   was   expecting   easy   to   install ,   easy   to   use .   the   noise ,   some   people   complain   about ,   comes   with   the   size   how   do   you   expect   to   blow   1600w   through   such   small   opening .   it   suits   my   needs .   i   m   giving   4   just   because   it   s   too   early   to   make   any   conclusions   regarding   quality .
guard   your   ears !   i   purchased   two   of   these   dryers ,   one   for   my   daughter   at   college   and   one   for   at   home .   mine   got   everyday   use ,   and   it   lasted   almost   18   months .   i   liked   its   small   size ,   making   it   easy   to   store   and   nice   to   pack   when   traveling ,   but   it   was   very   loud !   i   m   sure   that   my   hearing   suffered   from   it   s   screaming   airflow .   it   was   working   fine   until   a   couple   of   days   ago   when   something   blew   to   pieces   inside   and   it   shattered   to   a   stop .   my   daughter   s   is   still   working ,   but   it   only   get   used   once   and   a   while   for   travel .   br   i   would   not   recommend   this   dryer .   my   previous   dryer ,   a   conair ,   lasted   over   7   years   with   daily   use .   sometimes   even   drying   our   long   haired   dog .   br   i   purchased   a   new ,   full   sized   conair   121wft   turbo   in   hot   pink ,   yesterday .   it   is   so   quiet   and   the   grip   is   very   comfortable .   i   love   it   so   far .   br   i   would   never   go   back   to   that   ear   shattering   remington   again .
great   dual   voltage   hairdryer   i   have   not   yet   taken   it   abroad   to   try   the   other   voltage ,   but   will   in   about   2   weeks .   that   is   why   i   got   it ,   but   it   does   work   well   here ,   not   too   noisy   and   it   s   a   nice   size .
the   best   hair   dryer   ever !   this   is   a   great   product .   i   have   long ,   thick ,   curly ,   red   hair ,   and   it   works   wonders .   sometimes   i   want   straight   hair ,   so   i   ll   brush   and   dry   my   hair   at   the   same   time   for   the   straight   hair ,   and   it   works   great !   this   hair   dryer   dries   my   hair   in   10   min   flat ,   sometimes   in   5   minutes   depending   on   the   day .   i   also   love   the   cord   that   goes   into   the   dryer   itself .   so   awesome   and   convenient ! !   you   must   buy   this   hair   dryer ,   it   will   change   your   life !  
works   like   a   champ ...   a   heavyweight   though !   the   controls   are   pretty   straight   forward ,   no   different   than   most   other   hairdryers .   has   off ,   high ,   and   low   switch   along   with   a   cool   shot   that   surpresses   the   heat   for   cool   drying .   works   really   well   and   heats   nicely .   i   have   short   hair   so   it   only   took   a   minute   to   dry .   i   had   other   family   members   with   long   hair   give   it   a   shot   and   all   agreed   it   was   top   notch .   really   like   the   metallic   apple   color   too ,   makes   a   boring   hairdryer   look   like   a   pretty   cool   appliance .   the   negative   has   to   do   with   the   weight .   this   is   not   what   i   would   consider   a   travel   hairdryer .   one   other   reviewer   mentions   it   weighs   over   2   lbs   and   they   thought   that   was   light ...   i   totally   disagree .   if   you   travel   a   lot   you   know   that   2   lbs   added   to   your   suitcase   can   make   a   big   difference .   even   lugging   this   thing   to   the   gym   everyday   would   be   a   work   out .   it   does   come   with   a   travel   pouch   and   a   nice   feature   of   easily   twisting   and   untwisting   the   handle   does   make   it   a   little   more   compact ,   but   it   is   still   rather   bulky   to   stick   in   a   gym   bag   or   carry   on   suitcase .   i   highly   recommend   this   unit   for   home   use ,   for   travel ,   i   d   suggest   you   find   a   more   compact   lightweight   unit   and   skip   this   one .
pricey   but   worth   every   cent !   i   was   skeptical   about   paying   this   much   for   a   hair   dryer ... but   a   friend   of   mine   highly   recommended   it .. so   i   gave   it   a   go .   from   my   frist   drying   experience   i   noticed   a   huge   difference   in   my   hair !   it   is   super   quiet ... did   dry   my   hair   faster ,   with   less   force   and   no   tangling !   i   love   how   light   it   is ... and   how   shiney   it   made   my   hair !   i   got   a   load   of   compliments   that   first   day !   worth   the   cash !
not   too   bad   for   the   price   i   was   not   expecting   too   much   since   this   is   your   basic   hair   dryer .   the   price   was   good   for   the   item .   it   has   pretty   good   power ,   but   the   temperature   on   low   and   medium   settings   is   not   too   hot .   this   does   not   bother   me ,   but   some   may   like   a   warmer   temperature   on   the   lower   power   settings .
good   investment   after   several   uses   i   am   pleased   with   performance   my   hairstylist   recommended   i   buy   an   ionizer   hairdryer   because   it   does   not   dry   out   hair   as   much   as   others .   i   invested   a   couple   hours   researching   on   line   and   reviewing   the   products   here   at   amazon .   in   the   end ,   i   selected   the   conair   ion   shine   because   it   was   1875   watts ,   was   an   ionizer ,   was   priced   affordably ,   and   the   design   seemed   good .   br   br   now   that   i   have   received   the   item   and   have   had   some   time   to   use   it ,   here   are   my   ratings   br   storability   2.5   stars   there   is   a   hanging   loop ,   but   the   cord   is   heavy   and   awkward .   the   unit   is   heavy   enough   that   whatever   hook   one   would   hang   it   from   would   have   to   be   substantially   mounted   so   it   would   not   pull   out   of   the   wall .   wall   mounting   is   not   an   option   for   me   .   also ,   after   only   two   uses ,   the   cord   has   already   begun   to   twist ,   which   is   a   negative .   br   value   4.5   stars   i   knew   the   amazon   price   was   reasonable ,   even   lower   than   my   local   discount   stores .   after   i   purchased   this   item ,   i   found   the   same   model   at   big   lots   for   a   dollar   more   and   in   different   colors .   br   performance   5   stars   dries   hair   quickly   without   using   high   heat   temps .   unit   comes   with   a   few   attachments .   the   diffuser   is   really   large   and   awkward   to   store .   the   unit   has   a   hinged   filter   that   opens   easily   for   cleaning .   the   removable   filter   is   the   standard   small   piece   of   material   that   i   have   seen   in   other   high   tech   fan   devices ,   including   the   high   end   smarttechnologies   smart   board   in   my   classroom .   i   m   figuring   the   filter   material   is   pretty   standard .   in   my   previous   hair   dryer ,   the   fan   did   not   have   a   removable   filter   for   cleaning   eventually   the   old   fan   clogged   so   horribly   despite   my   attempts   to   brush   it   out   that   it   slowed   down   and   eventually   killed   the   unit .   br   br   other   note   if   a   younger   child   will   be   using   the   unit ,   she   may   find   the   unit   feels   heavy   or   hard   to   hold   after   a   while .   i   suggest   looking   for   one   of   the   smaller ,   portable   units   for   tweens .

srong   blow   but   not   enough   heat   c   grade   this   hair   dryer   has   the   makings   of   being   a   great   one .   it   has   a   great   blow ,   but   it   takes   forever   to   heat   up .   after   10   minutes   of   use ,   the   heat   was   still   lacking ,   leaving   my   hair   damp .   i   d   give   this   one   a   pass   and   not   worth   the   money .   nice   color   though .   br   br   katiebabs
still   excellent   after   years   of   use   this   is   an   excellent   dryer !   it   is   dependable   and   delivers   the   temperatures   i   expect ,   but   the   main   reason   i   chose   this   model   is   that   the   classic   squirrel   cage   blower   produces   great   air   flow .   i   was   never   satisfied   with   the   wimpy   blowers   on   most   of   the   other   styles .   i   bought   two   of   these   from   amazon   a   few   years   ago .   two ,   because   i   thought   such   an   inexpensive   dryer   might   not   last   long   very   long   and   buying   the   pair   was   a   better   bargain   because   the   order   qualified   for   free   shipping .   the   second   one   is   still   in   the   box   awaiting   its   turn   the   first   one   hasn   t   failed   yet .   i   see   several   comments   here   about   travel .   while   this   dryer   is   more   compact   than   many   of   the   bulky   styling   dryers ,   it   is   neither   dual   voltage   switchable   nor   universal   voltage   auto   converting   ,   so   pack   a   converter   if   you   carry   it   overseas .   i   use   a   smaller ,   folding ,   dual   voltage   model   for   travel   then   find   that   all   the   hotels   have   built   ins   anyway   .
only   lasted   2   months !   we   purchased   this   item   january   3 ,   2011   for   my   daughter   s   bathroom .   we   installed   it   the   following   week .   she   uses   a   hairdryer   infrequently ,   about   once   or   twice   a   week .   she   informed   us   tonight   that   the   nightlight   stopped   working   last   week   and   when   she   uses   the   hairdryer   it   smells   like   plastic   melting .   sure   enough ,   i   just   checked   it   out .   no   nightlight   plastic   burning   smell   when   turned   on .   our   return   period   window   for   amazon   is   now   expired .   i   just   wrote   andis   an   email   explaining   what   happened   and   will   be   waiting   for   a   response .   i   will   update   what   if   anything   customer   service   does   about   this   situation .   until   then ,   i   am   giving   this   item   one   star .

not   small   but   cute   and   effective   i   don   t   understand   why   the   packaging   says   ac   motor   and   the   blurb   says   dc   however   it   works   great .   it   does   have   a   large   ish   plug   which   i   assume   is   a   transformer   from   ac   to   dc .   i   love   the   color   which   is   more   intense   than   in   the   picture   think   granny   smith   apple .   i   thought   it   would   be   smaller   than   it   is   since   it   is   sort   of   billed   as   a   travel   dryer .   the   handle   does   an   easy   twist   to   fold   so   it   fits   in   the   accompanying   bag .   i   don   t   mind   the   size   as   it   is   powerful   enough   to   easily   dry   my   longish   and   very   thick   hair   and   most   travel   dryers   are   pretty   feeble .   what   more   can   i   ask   it   says   it   will   last   longer   than   most   dryers   which   is   great .   it   only   has   a   few   settings   hi   and   low   plus   a   cool   shot   override   button   all   i   ever   use   anyway .
basic   hair   dryer   love   the   metallic   green ,   and   the   dryer   ample   job .   the   cold   shot   is   also   a   helpful   feature .   however ,   i   was   expecting   a   much   different   hair   dryer .   the   cord   does   not   retract   into   the   handle   as   advertised .   also ,   the   dryer   is   much   larger   and   heavier   than   i   hoped   it   would   be .   it   also   would   would   have   been   nice   to   have   the   diffuser   attachment   to   create   funkier   hair   styles .   the   travel   bag   is   well   made .   truthfully ,   it   s   too   big   and   heavy   for   me   to   use   it   for   travel .
wall   mount   hair   dryer   i   ve   always   thought   that   the   wall   mounted   hair   dryers   in   hotel   rooms   were   a   great   idea .   they   don   t   take   up   space   on   your   bathroom   counter ,   you   don   t   have   to   wrap   the   cord   around   and   around   your   hair   dryer   which   can   eventually   lead   to   internal   wire   damage   ,   and   you   don   t   have   to   find   a   separate   place   to   store   it .   i   never   thought   of   actually   owning   one   in   my   own   home   until   i   visited   my   sister   a   few   years   ago ,   and   she   had   this   one   mounted   on   her   guest   bathroom   wall .   it   worked   great ,   and   i   knew   right   then   that   i   needed   one   of   these .   i   wrote   down   the   model   number   and   went   online   to   buy   one   as   soon   as   i   returned   home .   my   husband   was   more   than   happy   to   install   this   a   couple   of   screws   since   it   meant   no   more   hair   dryers   laying   on   the   bathroom   sink .   we   both   liked   it   so   much   that   he   even   suggested   that   i   go   ahead   and   buy   another   one   and   have   it   on   hand   for   when   the   first   one   wore   out .   my   granddaughter   told   me   the   other   day   that   she   needs   one   of   these .   guess   i   know   what   she   s   getting   for   christmas   this   year .
excellent   product ! ! !   i   love   being   able   to   just   sit   under   the   dryer   and   read   while   i   deep   condition   my   hair .   not   too   hot ,   and   it   covers   my   entire   head .   fast   shipping   and   good   pricing   for   hot   tools ! !
no   issues   with   delivery ,   no   issues   with   use   bought   this   for   my   daughter .   delivered   as   promised .   so   far   about   1   month   later   working   fine .   she   is   extremely   happy   with   the   product .   the   only   minor   issue   i   see   is   that   there   is   no   base   to   secure   it   on   the   wall .   it   does   have   a   loop ,   so   i   had   to   install   a   small   hook   on   the   wall   to   hang   it   from .
not   good   for   people   with   arthritis   or   smaller   hands   this   dryer   works   great ,   folds   up   nicely ,   the   only   thing   is ...   the   handle ,   it   is   to   big   around ,   and   it   is   to   smooth ,   i   had   a   hard   time   hanging   on   to   it . if   it   had   some   ridges   that   might   have   helped .   and   it   was   hard   trying   to   hold   the   cool   button   down   while   trying   to   set   my   hair .
really   light   for   travel   as   one   who   likes   to   travel   light ,   i   was   impressed   by   how   light   this   hairdryer   is .   it   is   a   bit   less   powerful   than   i   m   used   to   but   i   m   willing   to   take   that   trade   off .
ok   dryer ,   but   doesn   t   dry   any   faster   than   non   ion   dryers .   i   ve   read   some   reviews   on   here   that   this   dryer   is   burning   people   s   hair   off .   perhaps   in   an   attempt   to   correct   this ,   revlon   scaled   back   the   heat   output   significantly .   i   say   this   because   my   dryer   doesn   t   seem   to   get   nearly   as   hot   as   my   old ,   non   ion   dryer .   i   used   to   have   a   small ,   folding   travel   dryer .   it   burned   out   and   i   replaced   it   with   this .   my   hair   doesn   t   dry   any   more   quickly   even   though   the   thing   is   easily   twice   as   large   and   has   ion   technology .   also ,   my   old   travel   dryer   easily   got   hotter   than   this   one .   the   wind   power   isn   t   as   strong ,   either ,   even   on   the   highest   setting .   i   kind   of   like   this   because   my   hair   doesn   t   blow   everywhere   when   i   m   using   my   round   brush .   but   it   seems   like   the   high   setting   should   be   the   medium   setting .   anyway ,   ok   dryer .   nothing   to   write   home   about .
do   not   buy   warranty   issues   this   product   comes   with   a   one   year   warranty   from   the   merchant   as   opposed   to   a   four   year   warranty   from   the   manufacturer .   there   is   no   serial   number   attached   to   the   power   cord   so   you   can   t   register   for   warranty .   also   our   product   made   a   distinctive   sound   that   we   did   not   have   when   we   bought   our   first   hair   dryer   from   the   manufacturer   directly   5   years   ago ...   lesson   learned ,   wanted   to   try   to   save   on   the   purchase   price ,   lost   on   the   quality   and   warranty .   attempting   to   return   the   product .   i   would   advise   not   to   buy   this   product   from   this   merchant .
works   wonderfully   i   have   had   this   for   more   than   a   few   months   now ,   and   can   say   it   works   wonderfully .   i   have   not   noticed ,   personally ,   and   huge   difference   because   of   the   tourmaline   ions ,   but   that   isn   t   to   say   that   there   isn   t   any .   i   have   pretty   normal   hair ,   and   it   has   stayed   pretty   normal .   i   will   say   that   this   system   seems   to   dry   my   hair   a   bit   faster   and   it   does   not   get   that   brittle   feel   to   it   when   i   actually   use   it   to   style   my   hair   as   well .   good   product ,   good   price .   not   a   miracle   worker ,   but   reliability   is   sometimes   more   important   than   miracles  
great   hair   dryer   quiet !   this   hair   dryer   was   recommended   by   my   hair   stylist .   it   would   cost   200   at   a   retail   store .   she   suggested   i   check   on   amazon   for   a   better   price .   i   got   the   hair   dryer   for   half   the   retail   price .   the   ionic   ceramic   tourmaline   dryer   is   less   damaging   to   hair .   the   best   thing   is   that   it   s   quiet   for   a   blow   dryer   ...   more   of   a   hum   than   a   high   pitch   whistle   of   some   blow   dryers .

didn   t   last   6   months   i   bought   this   jerdon   wall   mount   hair   dryer   to   save   space   and   for   company   convenience .   it   was   mounted   in   an   upstairs   bathroom   and   lightly   used .   the   jerdon   hair   dryer   was   purchased   in   august   2010   and   quit   working   in   march   2011 .   it   s   not   a   good   idea   to   purchase   electrical   items   on   amazon ...... after   60   days   no   return !   if   i   had   paid   a   little   more   and   bought   locally ,   i   would   have   gotten   my   money   back   or   another   item .   sometimes   when   you   think   you   are   saving   money ,   you   re   not .   i   lost   all   the   way   around .   i   will   not   purchase   electrical   items   from   amazon   in   the   future .   bad   idea !
good   purchase   great   quality   i   use   it   a   lot ,   i   am   a   stylist   and   use   this   with   my   really   curly   hair   clients   and   it   never   disapoint   me .   great   price ,   great   quality ,   great   buy .
wall   hairdryer   good   size ,   nice   to   be   out   of   the   way   and   on   the   wall .   unfortunately ,   it   stopped   working   9   months   after   i   bought   it .   i   was   sent   a   replacement   and   hopefully ,   this   one   will   work   longer !
worth   it ..   i   have   been   using   this   product   for   nearly   a   month   now .   from   a   guy   perspective   i   think   this   product   is   really   great .   i   use   this   product   since   my   hair   is   quite   long   and   for   some   personal   reason   i   don   t   like   to   dry   my   hair   using   my   towel .   anyway ,   the   best   thing   about   this   hair   dryer   is   that   it   dries   my   hair   really   fast   and   also   produce   low   noise .   well ,   if   you   use   the   high   air   mode ,   the   noise   is   quite   loud   but   much   tolerable   than   other   products   i   have   used .   basically   i   just   used   the   low   air   mode   since   the   noise   is   low   and   it   isn   t   too   hot .   furthermore ,   when   you   first   use   this   product ,   it   will   have   a   burning   metal   smell   like   soldering   smell   .   however ,   after   3   4   times   of   use   the   smell   will   be   gone .   the   smell   won   t   stick   on   your   hair   though ,   so   it   isn   t   a   big   deal .   this   hair   dryer   is   light   which   i   think   is   a   plus .
not   hot   enough   made   my   hair   stiff   ok ,   beautiful   color ,   stylish ,   not   heavy   seems   long   lasting   probably   a   good   dryer   for   the   right   person .   unfortunately   i   will   have   to   return   it .   this   dryer   takes   a   very   long   time   to   dry   the   hair ,   it   is   not   hot   or   powerful   enough   this   should   be   best   for   fine   hair .   it   is   kind   of   uncomfortable   to   hold   as   well ,   i   feel   sad   since   i   have   to   return   it   but   it   is   not   right   for   me ,   love   the   pink   color   but   what   can   you   do  
do   not   buy   this   hair   dryer !   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   to   replace   another   conair   i   had   for   many   years .   after   one   year   i   am   going   back   to   my   old   one .   there   is   no   way   to   clean   the   vents   on   this   one   and   it   heats   up   hot .   it   burned   the   top   of   my   ear   the   other   day .   the   retractable   cord   is   a   nice   idea ,   but   if   it   retracts   too   fast   you   end   up   with   bruises   from   it   hitting   you   in   the   arm .   look   for   the   conair   dryers   that   have   vents   that   can   be   cleaned   and   they   will   last   you   a   good   long   time .   then   only   good   thing   about   it   is   it   travels   well .
the   best   hair   dryer   at   the   lowest   price   i   purchased   the   fhi   heat   nano   salon   pro   2000   six   months   ago ,   and   it   was   love   at   first   blowdry .   during   high   school   and   college ,   i   owned   a   series   of   inexpensive ,   low   quality   hair   dryers .   yes ,   after   half   an   hour   or   more   and   some   expletives ,   they   did   dry   my   hair ,   but   it   was   always   flat   and   without   shine .   i   blamed   my   hair ,   rather   than   the   hair   dryers .   br   br   at   the   warm   heat   setting   and   high   fan   setting ,   this   fhi   hair   dryer   gives   me   soft ,   voluminous   waves   in   less   than   fifteen   minutes .   i   never   knew   my   hair   could   look   so   beautiful   and   healthy !   i   blow   dry   it   immediately   after   every   morning   shower ,   and   i   use   asin   b004461zl4   sedu   anti   frizz   polishing   treatment   with   argan   oil ,   6.8   oz .   bottle   .   br   br   oh ,   and   i   almost   forgot !   the   first   time   i   turned   it   on ,   i   thought   i   had   received   a   defective   model   like   some   of   the   other   reviewers .   but   i   had   accidentally   pressed   the   blue   cold   shot   button   found   on   the   inside   of   the   hair   dryer   handle .   br   br   update   after   one   year   i   still   love   this   hair   dryer ,   and   it   s   working   just   as   well   as   the   day   i   purchased   it .
i   like   it   love   the   look   and   feel   of   this   hair   dryer .   a   little   heavier   than   i   thought   it   would   be   but   much   quieter   than   my   old   conair   and   i   am   pleased   with   the   results .   folds   and   packs   well   for   travel   and   i   like   the   retractable   cord .   would   recommend   it .
best   hair   dryer   bought   this   model   a   few   years   ago   and   i   really   like   it   because   the   high   setting   speed   is   just   right   for   styling   your   hair ... some   other   dryers   i   have   blow   too   fast   on   the   high   setting .   this   model   s   high   setting   is   a   good   speed   and   allows   you   to   dry   your   hair   without   it   blowing   all   over   the   place .   also   it   is   light   and   well   balanced   so   holding   it   while   drying   is   very   comfortable .   i   recently   bought   2   more   in   case   the   manufacturer   decides   to   stop   production .
nice   hair   dryer   this   is   a   nice   hair   dryer .   it   s   up   there   with   some   of   the   100   dryers   i   have   purchased .   it   isn   t   whisper   quiet ,   but   it   dries   hair   fairly   quickly .   i   love   that   it   has   four   different   heat   settings .   i   have   long ,   super   thick   hair ,   so   i   need   a   strong   dryer ,   and   this   definitely   does   the   job .
warrantee   period   apparently   reduced .   some   reviews   here   refer   to   a   5   year   warrantee .   no   doubt   true   at   the   time ,   but   instructions   now   say   one   year   and   ...   return   shipping   fee .
little   is   big   i   have   limited   space   in   my   apartment .. every   inch   counts .   that   doesn   t   mean   that   i   don   t   want   the   best ,   and   i   have   it   in   this   teeny   tiny   dryer .   tucks   into   one   of   my   baskets   when   not   in   use ,   but   when   in   use ,   works   like   a   charm .
wow !   my   hair   type   is   naturally   wavy ,   thick ,   and   frizz   prone .   with   this   hairdryer ,   my   hair   is   not   frizzy !   yay !   it   s   super   powerful ,   and   dries   my   hair   quicker   than   my   old   hairdryer .   this   hairdryer   is   so   great ,   it   makes   the   need   for   my   straightener   optional .   i   have   the   argan   heat   straightener ,   and   love   it ,   too .   they   are   the   perfect   pair   to   get   silky ,   shiny   hair .   i   also   like   that   my   hair   feels   soft   with   this .
comb   attachment   the   comb   attachment   consistly   flies   when   trying   to   dry   hair .   the   design   is   flawed   as   that   the   comb   does   not   stay   securely   when   using   the   dryer .   thought   that   is   the   comb   attachment   came   with   the   dryer   it   would   fit   securely !
buying   my   third !   i   loved   my   first   oster   wall   mount   hair   dryer   it   lasted   8   years   before   i   had   to   replace   it   with   the   same   model .   no .   2   just   died   after   7   years   dependable   service   the   plastic   fins   on   the   fan   became   brittle   and   snapped   off .   there   s   no   use   trying   to   improve   on   such   a   reliable   product ,   so   i   m   ordering   no .   3 .   the   current   price   is   only   slightly   higher   than   what   i   paid   for   the   other   two .
cute   hairdryer !   i   love   this   hairdryer ,   but   for   some   people ,   they   may   not   be   completely   ecstatic   with   the   settings   of   this   hairdryer .   with   this   hairdryer ,   you   cannot   really   control   the   temperature   of   the   air ,   only   how   intense   the   air   flows   from   the   dryer .   the   only   way   to   change   the   temperature   of   the   air   is   to   press   the   blue   button   on   the   hair   dryer   to   make   the   air   cooler .   other   than   that   side   note ,   i   love   the   color   of   the   hairdryer   and   how   quickly   it   dries   my   hair   my   hair   is   long   and   it   takes   about   15   minutes   to   blow   dry   my   hair   .
nice   profile   was   very   pleased   with   this   purchase .   the   profile   is   slim   and   looks   well   to   hang   on   wall .   it   has   different   speeds   with   pleases   me .   very   happy   to   have   purchased   this   as   a   replacement   for   one   i   had   for   years .   jerdon   1600w   wall   mount   hair   dryer
great   for   vacation   rentals   the   hair   dryer   is   very   easy   to   install .   you   first   mount   a   flat   metal   plate   to   the   wall   and   then   the   base   unit   attaches   to   that   plate .   we   bought   these   for   a   vacation   rental   and   appreciate   the   fact   that   the   power   cord   is   attached   to   the   base   unit   and   not   the   hair   dryer   itself .   while   this   may   not   be   convenient   or   preferred   for   home   use ,   in   a   vacation   rental   it   keeps   them   in   one   place .
powerful   for   a   travel   hair   dryer   yes ,   it   s   almost   a   full   size   hair   dryer   but   it   does   fold   and   the   cord   retracts .   more   importantly   it   s   powerful   ...   more   than   other   so   called   travel   hair   dryers   with   the   same   wattage   1875 !   and   the   cold   shot   doesn   t   slow   down   to   the   point   of   almost   being   off ,   like   other   travel   hair   dryers ! ! !   annoying .   but   not   on   this   one .   of   course   i   d   prefer   a   lighter   dryer   with   the   same   features   but   until   then   this   one   fits   the   bill .   i   d   rather   lug   something   a   little   heavy   that   s   going   to   get   me   out   the   door   fast   and   enjoying   my   vacation !   at   this   price ,   i   ll   be   perfectly   happy   if   it   only   lasts   me   thru   my   upcoming   10   day   vacation .   good   price .
value   shopper   powerful   hairdryer .   it   doesn   t   have   a   cool   setting ,   so   if   that   is   a   concern   check   out   the   other   andis   dryers .   love   the   bright   night   light ,   it   is   a   soft   white !
does   not   dry   my   hair   the   concept   seemed   perfect   combing   and   drying   your   hair   at   the   same   time .   the   problem   is   that   it   simply   does   not   dry   my   hair .   not   even   at   the   highest   setting .   very   disappointing .
nice   dryer   for   thin ,   fine   textured   hair   i   bought   this   dryer   to   replace   a   virtually   identical   but   much   older   vidal   sassoon   hair   dryer   the   vs781   , which   had   finally   stopped   working   after   probably   a   decade .   the   thing   i   liked   most   about   the   older   dryer ,   and   which   i   like   about   this   one   which   is   basically   the   same   dryer   with   a   new   color   and   model   number   ,   is   that   it   doesn   t   get   excessively   hot   even   on   the   highest   setting ,   and   doesn   t   blow   as   hard   as   most   other   dryers .   for   someone   with   thick   hair   this   might   be   a   real   problem ,   but   i   ve   got   very   thin ,   fine ,   slightly   frizzy   hair   that   doesn   t   benefit   from   a   strong   airflow .   most   hair   dryers ,   even   on   lower   speeds ,   dry   sections   of   my   hair   so   rapidly   that   i   don   t   have   a   proper   chance   to   style   them   with   a   brush ,   and   the   rest   of   my   rather   sparse   hair   gets   whipped   around   as   if   in   a   tornado .   that   doesn   t   happen   with   this   vidal   sassoon   model .   the   oval   shaped   barrel   seems   to   also   help   concentrate   the   airflow .   i   also   like   the   fact   that   this   dryer   has   three   heat   settings   and   two   speed   settings   which   can   be   selected   independently .   with   some   dryers   high   speed   is   paired   with   high   heat   whether   you   want   it   or   not .   the   ionic   setting   on   this   dryer   does   make   a   difference   and   makes   my   hair   a   tad   smoother   however   it   also   tends   to   make   it   more   limp .   so   as   a   rule ,   i   use   the   dryer   with   the   ion   setting   in   the   off   position   except   when   drying   the   ends   of   my   shoulder   length   hair .   probably   someone   with   thick ,   coarse   hair   wouldn   t   have   this   issue .   i   ve   had   this   dryer   for   only   about   5   weeks ,   so   it   s   too   early   to   comment   on   whether   it   s   built   to   last   i   was   definitely   lucky   to   get   so   many   years   out   of   my   older   model .   this   model   might   not   be   just   right   for   every   head   of   hair ,   but   for   mine ,   it   s   perfect .   i   hope   vidal   sassoon   continues   making   this   type   of   dryer   for   a   long   time .
about   the   220   v   settings   note   i   do   not   own   this   hair   dryer ,   but   to   add   a   review   i   had   to   add   a   star   rating .   i   used   the   average   of   4   stars   to   keep   the   rating   unchanged .   br   br   please   note   that   a   lot   of   these   hair   dryers   do   nothing   more   than   mechanically   lock   out   the   on   off   switch   from   using   the   hi   temp   setting   when   set   for   220   volt   input   for   foreign   countries .   that   is   very   typical .   br   br   please   also   note   that   the   low   heat   mode   at   220   volts   does   not   work   the   same   as   110   volts .   from   an   electrical   point   of   reference ,   doubling   the   voltage   yields   a   four   fold   increase   in   power   wattage   .   if   the   low   heat   mode   at   110   volts   usa   value   is   400   watts ,   then   using   this   dryer   in   low   heat   mode   at   220   volts   eg ,   europe   would   generate   1600   watts .   that   s   the   way   the   power   equation   works .   that   s   how   my   current   unit   worked   when   we   vacationed   in   europe .   low   heat   mode   at   220   volts   generates   high   heat   and   a   fast   fan   speed .   br   br   what   you   lose   is   the   low   power   curling   and   shaping   mode   when   using   these   dryers   at   220   volts .   there   is   no   400   watt   option   in   the   220   volt   setting .   br   br   if   you   want   both   high   and   low   heat   modes ,   buy   a   transformer   to   convert   220   to   110   volts   and   be   sure   it   is   big   enough ,   power   wise ,   to   handle   the   110   volt   high   heat   wattage   .   the   cost ,   beyond   the   purchase   price   of   the   transformer ,   is   the   added   transformer   weight   in   your   travel   luggage .   br   br   i   hope   this   clarifies   how   these   type   hair   dryers   work   in   europe ....   a   retired   electrical   engineer .   br   br   ps   going   from   usa   60   hertz   a . k . a .   60   cycles   to   european   50   hertz   makes   no   difference   for   this   appliance .   br   br   pps   none   of   the   220   v   countries   use   our   110   v   two   prong   or   three   prong   wall   plug .   even   if   you   don   t   buy   the   transformer ,   br   you   will   need   a   plug   converter   kit   to   plug   this   hair   dryer   into   the   220   v   wall   outlet   found   with   the   luggage   in   most   department   stores   or   on   br   amazon   under   plug   converter   but   be   sure   to   get   the   220   to   110   version   and   not   the   110   to   220   for   europeans   visiting   usa   .
nothing   negative   to   say ...   i   gave   this   dryer   to   my   sister ,   who   raved   about   it   and   said   it   was   the   best   hair   dryer   she   d   ever   used .   here   is   the   review   she   wrote   for   me   the   remington   pearl   ceramic   hair   dryer   comes   with   a   full   line   of   useful   features ...   among   its   better   aspects ,   the   dryer   is   attractive ,   lightweight ,   and   marvellously   quiet .   it   has   a   cool   shot   as   well   as   three   heat   settings   which   get   warm   enough   to   dry   hair   quickly ,   without   frying   it .   the   dryer   comes   with   an   attached   hook   from   which   it   can   be   hung ,   as   well   as   a   diffuser   and   a   concentrator .   the   result   is   sleek ,   straight ,   or   wavy   hair   depending   on   which   attachment   you   use .   i   highly   recommend   this   dryer .   i   can   find   nothing   negative   to   say   about   it .   so ...   there   ya   go !
great   dryer   for   a   reasonable   price   i   had   first   seen   used   this   hairdryer   at   a   hampton   inn   and   was   impressed   with   how   well   it   performed   quiet ,   powerful ,   and   solid .   not   too   heavy ,   with   a   grippy   handle .   so ... i   bought   one   for   myself   and   love   it !
it   dries .   i   had   my   last   hair   dryer   for   8   years ,   it   finally   burnt   out   on   me .   it   was   also   a   conair ,   and   so   i   thought   i   would   stick   with   what   i   knew .   br   br   i   have   really   thin   hair ,   that   dries   if   a   breeze   blows   through   the   apartment .   i   just   need   a   simple   hairdryer ,   easy   to   use ,   with   a   cord   that   retracts .   this   dryer   does   the   trick .   br   br   my   only   complaint   is   the   on   off   and   low   med   high   heat   buttons .   they   arent   raised ,   they   only   have   bumps   so   that   your   fingers   ahve   to   either   press   down   hard   and   hope   the   friction   works ,   or   you   use   a   nail   to   force   them   up .   many   times   my   hands   have   been   oily   from   lotion ,   or   even   dry   as   the   desert   and   they   wont   move .   its   a   little   frustrating .
great   for   price   it   works   great   for   the   price ,   it   s   not   loud   at   all   compared   to   a   small   portable   one   i   upgraded   from   .   the   only   qualms   that   i   have   is   that   there   s   no   separate   set   of   buttons   for   heat   settings .   basically   the   higher   speed   setting   is   also   the   hottest   and   vice   a   versa   for   the   the   lowest .
not   worth   the   money .   i   received   the   hair   dryer   nov   15   and   by   the   end   of   january   high   had   totally   quit   working .   by   the   time   i   was   able   to   get   on   line   the   end   of   february   because   of   personal   issues   to   find   out   how   to   return   it ,   it   was   too   late   to   get   free   shipping   and   a   full   refund ,   so   guess   i   m   stuck   with   it .
love   it ! ! !   absolutely   love   this   dryer !   i   have   really   thick   coarse   hair   and   have   always   had   to   flat   iron   my   hair   after   drying   but   not   anymore ! ! !   15   minutes   and   i   am   ready   to   go ! ! !   no   flat   iron   necessary ! ! !
it   s   good ,   not   great ... just   good   i   received   this   hair   dryer   yesterday   and   used   it   today   for   the   first   time ...   what   i   liked   i   was   really   drawn   to   the   price   and   i   still   feel   that   it   a   great   value .   it   has   two   settings   the   low   is   nice   and   cool   and   the   high   is   warm   but   not   too   hot .   i   like   this   because   i   try   to   use   as   little   heat   as   possible .   it   has   a   lot   of   holes   in   the   hood   so   it   drys   your   hair   very   quickly .   it   s   not   as   loud   as   i   thought   it   would   be .   what   i   didn   t   like   and   might   also   bother   other   users   i   don   t   use   rollers ,   but   for   anyone   who   does ,   this   hood   might   be   a   bit   small .   i   m   5   10   and   the   height   is   perfect   for   me ,   so   if   you   are   shorter   that   might   be   an   issue .   i   used   it   at   my   kitchen   table .   there   aren   t   enough   holes   around   the   back   so   about   3   4   way   through   you   have   to   turn   around   with   your   body   facing   the   machine .   that   s   ultimately   my   biggest   dislike   about   the   machine .   overall   i   m   happy   with   the   item   and   i   d   order   it   again .   hope   this   helps !
pure   junk   not   the   real   sp62   when   i   bought   this ,   a   real   sp62   was   shown   in   the   picture .   what   i   received   is   the   one   now   shown   in   a   replacement   picture .   it   is   narrower ,   with   several   fewer   blades   than   a   real   sp62   and   does   not   function   nearly   as   well .   don   t   wast   your   money   on   this   piece   of   junk ,   it   makes   the   shaver   not   worth   using .
helmet   hair   i   tried   this   product   last   night .   let   my   hair   dry   naturally .   went   to   bed .   barely   brushed   it   this   a . m .   went   snowboarding   with   full   head   face   mask   and   helmet   it   was   cold ! !   hair   was   only   mildly   messy   when   i   removed   helmet .   ran   a   brush   through   it   and   it .   looks .   awesome !   like   i   just   washed   it   and   had   a   blowout .   it   s   soft ,   bouncy   and   shiny .   i   never   write   beauty   reviews ,   and   it   s   even   rarer   that   i   will   spend   over   20   on   a   hair   product .   this   is   worth   it .   really   unbelievable .
great   seller .   great   item .   i   had   to   get   a   second   one   because   i   was   taking   it   to   my   dad   s   and   bringing   it   back   for   my   husband .   love   these   things .   if   you   want   a   close   trim   without   having   to   break   out   the   old   sharp   razor   that   usually   makes   you   bleed   ,   this   is   your   trimmer .   i   use   this   on   my   dad   s   face .   he   has   a   very   stiff   beard .
tangle   teaser   i   like   the   tangle   teaser   brush .   it   does   detangle   hair   more   gently   than   a   comb   or   denman   brush .   i   dont   feel   like   my   hair   is   thoroughly   brushed   afterwards .   i   think   becasue   the   teeth   give   so   easily ..   i   do   use   it   a   lot   though   and   would   recommend   it   to   be   added   to   anyones   grooming   routine .   but   i   still   feel   as   though   another   brush   or   comb   would   be   needed   to   complete   the   grooming .
smells   good ,   works   good ,   looks   good   it   smells   good ,   is   a   nice   texture   not   too   thick ,   not   runny   ,   and   doesn   t   weigh   down   my   long ,   fine   hair .   i   rub   a   bit   on   the   split   ends   on   any   stray   hairs   a   great   grooming   creme .   a   little   goes   a   long   way .   cool   pink   pump   container ,   too .
claiborne   by   liz   bought   this   for   my   brother   for   christmas .   he   really   likes   it .   it   is   now   discontinued   but   he   said   that   curves   is   the   same   fragrance
the   best   shampoo   and   conditioner   what   can   i   say ,   moroccan   oil   products   are   awesome ! ! !   unlike   other   products   that   claim   they   repair   your   hair   but   only   act   as   a   bandage ,   moroccan   oil   products   actually   repair   your   hair   and   improve   the   look   and   feel .   they   also   smell   amazing .
love   it   its   awesome ! !   you   just   have   to   dab   a   little   bit   on   your   eyelid   and   rub   it   in   with   your   finger .   i   would   recommend   it   to   anyone  
fierce   i   bought   this   aftershave   in   california   a   few   years   ago   while   on   holiday , im   from   scotland . and   when   iwear   it   everyone   comments   on   it , guys   and   girls , if   im   in   a   bar   or   club , people   always   ask   me   what   im   wearing   and   how   good   it   smells . i   don   t   wear   anything   else   now . thank   goodness   a   f   opened   a   store   in   the   uk . its   an   aftershave   u   can   wear   anytime . love   it
love   this   stuff !   i   picked   this   lotion   up   at   wal   mart   one   spring   in   the   summer   tanning   products   section .   i   loved   the   smell   and   it   made   my   skin   soft   without   being   greasy .   i   ve   never   peeled   while   using   this   lotion .   when   i   ran   out ,   i   was   very   disappointed   that   this   was   apparently   a   one   time   stock   for   wal   mart .   i   checked   over   and   over   again   to   no   avail .   imagine   my   surprise   when   i   found   it   in   the   christmas   tree   shop   and   for   less   money !   i   immediately   bought   four   bottles .   i   cannot   remember   the   exact   price ,   but   i   believe   it   is   cheaper   in   christmas   tree   shops   than   it   is   here   on   amazon .   lots   of   natural   ingredients   too ,   which   is   a   plus   for   me   as   i   have   atopic   skin .   great   product !
amazing   i   been   using   this   face   wash   for   last   3   years   now   and   all   i   can   say   is   this   face   wash   does   wonders ,   it   cleared   away   all   my   acne ,   all   my   scars   that   were   left   by   the   acne ,   and   made   my   skin   way   softer ,   of   course   this   wasnt   only   because   the   face   wash ,   i   had   to   put   on   facial   lotion   as   well   for   the   acne   to   really   go   away   but   this   face   wash   does   what   it   does   and   not   heavy   on   your   skin   compare   to   many   other   acne   facial   wash   i   tried
darker   than   expected ,   but   still   nice   from   the   bottle   and   the   rave   reviews   i   expected   a   nice   deep   purple   maroon   color ,   but   the   polish   is   thin ,   so   unless   you   can   get   it   on   perfectly   you   need   more   coats ,   and   this   causes   it   to   be   extremely   dark .   it   s   still   nice ,   but   i   feel   like   i   have   black   nail   polish   on .   in   low   light   it   even   seems   like   it   is   black .   i   don   t   love   it   as   much   as   some   people   must ,   because   i   don   t   think   i   would   buy   this   again .
lola   gift   set   by   marc   jacobs   this   lovely   boxed   gift   set   arrived   on   time   was   a   gift   and   was   greatly   appreciated   by   the   recipient .   the   box   is   actually   pretty   enough   to   keep   treassured   trinkets   in   or   letters   or   whatever .   the   fragrance   is   very   pleasant .   very   nice
great   price !   this   is   a   great   price   for   this   product !   if   your   hair   needs   some   tlc   from   the   dry ,   winter   air ,   this   is   a   great   shampoo .
great   but   not   included   everything   this   product   works   great ,   tried   many   different   hair   removal   techniques   and   this   one   being   one   of   the   best   i   found .   only   complaints   i   have   for   this   item   is   that   i   only   received   the   four   larger   discs   and   not   any   of   the   smaller   discs .
lasted   less   than   1   year   i   had   submitted   a   review   in   february   after   owning   this   iron   for   about   10   months .   now   that   i   have   owned   it   a   year   and   no   longer   have   a   warranty   it   has   quit   working .   it   is   a   great   iron ,   but   only   plan   to   have   it   for   a   year .   if   you   are   only   interested   in   a   short   time   using   a   great   iron ,   and   then   spending   the   100   dollars   again ,   then   get   this   iron .   i   was   very   disappointed   when   it   broke ,   as   i   thought   i   d   get   2   3   years   out   of   it .   it   is   made   really   lightweight ... so   i   guess   it   should   not   have   surprised   me .   i   just   hate   spending   more   money   so   soon .   i   am   going   to   send   it   to   the   company   and   see   if   they   will   help   me .   save   your   receipt .   i   typically   always   do ,   but   for   some   reason   i   can   t   find   this   one .   ugh
love   it !   i   made   shea   custard   with   this   gel   i   got   the   recipe   off   of   curly   nikki   forum   ,   my   hair   loved   it !   i   got   great   curl   definition   with   none   of   the   hardness   that   comes   from   using   gel   alone .
pleasantly   surprised   i   ve   never   used   a   pumice   stone   before   so   when   i   purchased   this   one   and   used   it   for   the   first   time .   i   was   pleasantly   surprised   at   how   it   worked .   my   tootsies   were   soft   on   the   bottom   like   they   hadn   t   been   all   winter .   br   br   i   m   so   glad   i   purchased   this .   plus ,   the   little   string   allows   me   to   hang   it   with   my   loofah .
great   for   the   price   i   ve   had   this   shaver   for   over   two   months   now .   being   in   my   early   60   s ,   i   ve   been   shaving   a   long   time .   having   had   many   shavers   in   my   life   i   d   rate   this   one   as   a   good   shaver .   i   ve   had   other   panasonic   shavers   that   did   work   better ,   but   cost   much   much   more .   for   me   the   bottom   line   is   this   is   a   good   shaver   at   a   great   price .
it   works   i   bought   this   kit   for   the   screwdriver ,   and   while   it   is   small ,   it   does   work .   the   kit   comes   packaged   in   a   sturdy   plastic   box .   overall ,   it   works .
moisturiezer   i   think   this   product   is   ok ,   but   overpriced   and   there   is   more   of   the   bottle   than   there   is   of   the   moisturizer .   peter   thomas   roth   should   start   lowering   his   prices   for   his   products .   i   can   buy   more   products   cheaper   than   his   from   kohls   that   also   do   wonders   for   my   skin   and   they   at   least ,   allow   the   consumer   to   use   their   discounts   on   every   item   including   perfumes   and   make   up .....
not   that   different   really !   i   have   very   naturally   healthy   and   shiny ,   very   straight   dark   hair ,   like   that   of   the   native   amercans .   my   hair   holds   a   curl   very   well .   i   already   owned   2   different   kinds   of   ceramic   wavers   and   was   looking   for   a   more   natural   and   less   kinky   kind   of   wave .   this   waver   is   ok ,   but   not   really   what   i   expected .   in   my   opinion   it   is   not   much   different   than   the   other   wavers   that   are   not   described   as   deep   wavers .   i   do   hold   hot   tools   brand   in   high   regard   from   owning   their   products   for   numerous   years .   i   would   definitely   take   this   deep   waver   over   the   other   regular   wavers ,   but   wish   i   wouldn   t   have   invested   more   money   into   the   same   kind   of   thing ,   more   or   less .   i   also   do   not   like   the   dial   adjustment   used   to   set   the   temp   on   this   because   it   is   loose   and   changes   on   its   own .   i   taped   mine   down   so   that   it   wouldn   t   accidentally   set   to   a   higher   temp   and   burn   my   hair .   hope   this   is   helpful .

no   shredding !   if   you   are   like   me ,   the   cheap   cotton   rounds   shred   when   using   them   leaving   annoying   pieces   of   cotton   all   over   your   hand   and   face .   i   ve   always   paid   more   for   premium   rounds   less   likely   to   shred   and   they   are   becoming   harder   to   find   in   the   stores   in   my   area .   these   don   t   shred   and   have   the   choice   of   an   exfoliating   side   or   soft   side .   search   carefully   at   amazon . com   to   find   the   lowest   cost .   i   got   mine   for   19.99   for   a   box   of   8   tubes   and   free   shipping   when   i   added   another   free   shipping   product   that   i   also   wanted .   i   m   happy   to   store   these   until   i   use   them   given   the   quality   and   price   i   paid .
better   for   the   summer   bought   it   on   sale   because   it   said   for   normal   to   dry   skin ,   and   i   have   dry   skin .   it   s   too   thin   to   be   a   real   dry   skin   lotion   i   think   it   might   be   okay   for   the   summertime ,   but   for   my   winter   thirsty   skin   i   definitely   need   something   creamier .   too   bad ,   because   i   love   the   smell .   it   s   a   soft ,   citrusy   smell   that   s   not   too   overpowering   but   still   wakes   you   up   and   makes   you   feel   happier   in   the   morning .
great ! !   the   3   jars   are   a   much   better   deal   and   love   the   foam ! !   after   4   months   hair   growing   in   really   good ! ! !
it   really   does   feel   velvety   after   washing   your   hands   with   this   soap .   even   though   i   rinse   my   hands   thoroughly ,   they   sill   feel   really   soft   and   velvety   after   drying .   in   the   couple   weeks   since   switching   to   this   soap   my   hands   have   never   felt   better .   i   have   somewhat   dry   skin   and   most   soaps   really   irritate   my   skin   and   i   try   to   rinse   well   to   prevent   itchiness .   i   ve   found   that   not   only   do   i   not   have   to   rinse   very   long   but   i   rarely   get   itchy   anymore   and   i   love   the   smell   of   tea   tree   oils ,   which   was   what   persuaded   me   to   get   this   to   begin   with .
wonderful .   steamy .   affordable .   sets   up   in   few   mins .   excellent   sets   up   very   easily   and   quickly .   no   tools   needed .   literally   just   a   few   minutes .   i   put   in   a   bar   stool   to   sit   on   and   a   towel   over   the   vent   holes .   as   others   have   said ,   the   towel   over   the   fresh   air   hole   is   needed   in   order   to   keep   the   steam   in .   i   don   t   know   why   people   complain   about   the   air   vent   holes .   for   2   bucks   you   can   buy   a   towel   for   them   or   for   2000   you   can   buy   a   different   style   of   steam   sauna .   seriously   folks ,   buy   a   towel .   add   a   little   aromatherapy   salts   and   it   is   bliss !   hard   to   find   this   kind   of   bliss   for   a   mere   200   bucks .   i   get   mine   almost   painfully   hot   in   30   mins   then   lower   the   temp ,   get   in ,   and   reset   the   timer .   the   picture   displayed   is   a   little   off   as   the   door   opens   from   one   side   and   not   down   the   middle   as   pictured .   no   worries   though .   it   s   nice .   i   would   buy   it   again .
used   for   years   i   started   using   spf   moisturizer   in   my   early   20   s .   part   of   the   way   in   i   remembered   my   grandmother   used   the   original   oil   of   olay   and   i   switched   to   this   brand .   it   is   much   more   expensive   than   the   one   i   used   to   use   but   worth   the   switch .   i   used   the   lotion   wrongly   assuming   it   was   cream ,   but   the   cream   lasts   longer   and   my   skin   is   noticeably   more   supple   and   moisturized   upon   use .   my   little   sister   also   in   her   20   s   has   caught   on   and   begun   to   use   it   as   well .   nothing   substitutes   taking   care   of   your   body   from   the   inside   so   your   outside   looks   great ,   but   i   swear   by   this   moisturizer   and   it   has   not   failed   me   for   years   and   hopefully   for   many   years   to   come .
perfect   i   have   owned   a   makeup   mirror   for   many   years   and   this   one   is   better   than   the   other   two   i   have   owned .   this   is   one   is   more   stable   no   matter   what   position   you   have   it   sitting   in .
not   so   much   i   have   combination   skin   which   has   become   more   dry   this   winter   so   i   was   looking   for   extra   moisture .   i   did   not   like   this   moisturizer .   i   found   it   to   be   too   fragrant   and   left   my   skin   feeling   more   dry .   i   also   felt   that   it   left   an   uncomfortable   residue   on   my   face .   i   really   like   facial   products   that   feel   clean   and   natural .   this   did   not   for   me .
don   t   trust   the   picture !   this   toothpaste   does   not   have   fluoride !   i   made   the   mistake   of   trusting   that   the   picture   on   this   product   page   was   actually   a   picture   of   what   i   would   get .   it   clearly   says   that   it   is   sls   free   fluoride   toothpaste .   the   toothpaste   i   received   is   sls   free ,   but   does   not   have   fluoride .   i   m   in   the   process   of   returning   it .
superb   sunscreen   have   used   this   sunscreen   for   several   years   and   know   that   it   is   a   superb   product .   i   especially   like   the   fact   that   it   is   fragrance   free   and   can   be   used   under   makeup   easily .
works   great !   but   beware   i   ve   been   using   for   over   a   month   now   and   i   see   a   huge   differance ! it   has   made   my   lashes   almost   twice   as   long   and   about   1   3   thicker   but   not   any   darker   natural   blonde   my   lashes   are   white   .   now   for   the   beware   part   do   not   buy   from   directsupercenter ! ! !   i   got   my   package   very   late .   box   came   totally   crushed   i   had   wanted   to   give   the   first   one   i   bought   to   a   friend   as   a   gift   but   being   late   and   crushed   i   could   not .   also   i   looked   and   the   rapidlash   it   self   had   been   opened   and   tampered   with   after   being   listed   as   new !
a   nice   gift   for   cancer   patients   my   hair   stylist   recommended   this   product ,   and   had   me   start   on   it   before   i   started   chemo ,   during   it ,   and   after   it   was   over .   even   though   it   was   tough   and   sad   to   put   on   my   scalp   during   the   process ,   having   no   hair ,   i   m   glad   i   did .   it   sort   of   gave   me   reassurance   that   yes ,   someday   i   would   have   hair   again .   after   a   year   of   having   to   wear   a   hot   wig ,   when   my   hair   did   come   back ,   it   came   back   very   strong   and   full ! ! !   i   m   not   real   big   on   the   minty   smell ,   but   i   definitely   would   recommend   the   product ,   and   gave   it   to   a   friend   that   was   going   to   be   going   through   chemo   too .
unbelievable   there   is   no   way   not   to   recommend   this   product .   since   the   first   time   i   used   i   felt   the   difference   in   my   hair   it   s   softer   and   brighter .   sometimes   with   other   conditioners ,   hair   tends   to   fell ,   but   you   won   t   feel   this   with   sos   reparacion .
you   get   what   you   pay   for   very   uncomfortable ,   i   can   t   have   it   on   for   more   than   5   minutes .   i   bought   it   because   it   was   cheap ,   but   i   guess   you   get   what   you   paid   for   a   cheap   product   with   cheap   quality
a   light   and   effective   cream   for   face   and   body   this   cream   is   amazing !   it   is   light ,   absorbs   quickly ,   and   doesn   t   have   a   dramatic   scent .   it   has   been   very   effective   for   my   skin   during   the   winter   months   when   i   typically   struggle   to   keep   my   skin   moisturized .   this   is   especially   true   for   my   face .   i   usually   struggle   with   dry   patches   on   my   face   in   the   winter   that   only   look   highlighted   by   makeup   and   i   hadn   t   found   a   moisturizer   that   ridded   it   completely .   this   was   the   one .   i   use   it   morning   and   night   and   haven   t   had   an   issue   with   dry   patches ,   at   all .   my   powder   makeup   glides   on   easily   afterward   and   the   cream   does   not   feel   heavy   or   oily .   wonderful   stuff .   i   also   use   it   as   a   body   lotion   equally   as   great   results .   highly   recommend   this   to   anyone   who   wants   a   good   cream   that   doesn   t   have   to   be   continuously   reapplied .   added   bonus   the   price   is   great   through   subscribe   and   save !
didn   t   recieve   i   have   not   recieved   this   product   so   i   can   t   give   an   accurate   review .   i   would   like   someone   to   contact   me ,   it   s   been   over   a   month   since   i   ordered   this   product .
hands   down   best   detangler ...   this   is   the   only   detangler   i   have   found   anywhere   that   will   work   on   both   my   daughter   s   hair   and   not   leave   it   greasy .   they   are   now   13   and   9   and   very   picky   about   how   their   hair   looks   all   of   the   time .   i   can   even   dilute   it   half   with   water   and   it   still   does   an   outstanding   job   of   keeping   snarls   and   frizzies   under   control   every   day .   only   down   side   is   that   there   are   no   local   stores   that   carry   this   product   any   more ...
east   feet   not   so   easy   i   thought   this   sounded   like   a   great   idea   but   was   disappointed .   the   brissels   need   to   be   softer   and   they   bent   after   the   very   first   very   brief   use .   i   doesn   t   stay   in   place   when   moving   foot   back   n   forth .   i   tried   to   lodge   it   in   a   corner   but   of   course   when   you   move   your   foot   backwards   it   will   not   stay   in   place . just   a   note   i   did   not   purchase   at   amazon .
vintage .   get   it   while   you   can !   as   a   scent   o   phile ,   this   was   a   classic   that   just   had   to   be   tested   for   my   collection .   visit   basenotes   dot   net   to   read   about   the   legacy   of   this   fragrance .   if   you   like   creed   s   version   of   original   vetiver ,   but   find   it   a   bit   too   clean   and   light   for   a   vetiver ,   you   really   must   try   guerlain   s   formulation .   this   set   is   not   the   newest   recipe ,   but   the   previous   one   from   the   90s .   apparently   the   newer   version   is   a   bit   brighter ,   but   not   nearly   as   rich .   br   br   this   starts   clean   with   a   hint   of   lemon   and   grass   clippings ,   but   quickly   dries   down   to   an   earthy   and   slightly   mineralic   cedar .   final   dry   down   is   to   a   rich   and   exceptionally   warm   woody   oak   moss   with   a   powdery   overlay .   soapy   clean   permeates   throughout   the   entire   range   of   the   scent .   this   is   mature ,   masculine   and   a   barbershop   clean   classic .   makes   creed   s   version   seem   flat   and   incredibly   overpriced .   br   br   the   edt   miniature   is   splash   only   no   spray   .   the   aftershave   lotion   smells   even   warmer   than   the   edt ,   due   to   high   oil   content   and   no   alcohol .   the   bath   gel   shampoo   is   a   bit   chemical   smelling   at   first ,   but   complements   the   cologne   well   enough .
to   get   dark   ash   blonde   this   color   is   darker   and   more   ash .   br   it   will   really   eliminate   brassy   and   gold   tones ,   if   you   ve   had   your   hair   lightened   and   are   dissatisfied   with   brassiness .   br   if   you   don   t   like   the   result ,   it   s   simple   to   wash   out .   it   is   a   temporary   to   semi   permanent   color .   br   i   love   it ,
disappointed ! !   i   read   all   of   the   other   reviews   for   this   iron   and   thought   it   would   be   great .   i   have   used   a   chi   for   about   8   years   now   both   the   wide   and   the   regular   1   .   this   iron   did   not   compare   to   the   chi .   even   on   a   high   heat   setting ,   although   it   straightened   my   hair   it   did   not   get   rid   of   all   of   the   frizz   like   the   chi   does .   also ,   i   only   have   to   pass   over   my   hair   2   times   with   the   chi ,   whereas   with   this   iron   i   had   to   go   over   it   4   times   or   more   and   still   did   not   get   the   same   results .   this   iron   was   also   a   lot   more   difficult   despite   other   reviews   to   glide   through   the   hair   compared   to   the   chi ,   so   it   took   a   lot   longer   to   do   my   hair   with   it   between   more   passes   and   slower   gliding .   this   iron   was   no   better   than   a   discount   store   bought   40   iron   to   me .   very   disappointed !
good   performer   for   the   price   this   dryer   packs   a   lot   of   punch   for   a   small   footprint .   light   small   enough   to   travel .   haven   t   tried   the   220v   option   yet .
quick   and   easy   conair   is   a   great   brand   for   hair   dryers .   my   previous   one   was   still   going   after   8   years   but   figured   it   was   just   time   for   an   upgrade !   this   hair   dryer   is   great   heats   up   quickly ,   dries   hair   fast   and   really   does   have   a   comfortable   grip .   the   cool   air   button   gets   cold   fast   too ,   and   it   s   not   very   loud ,   even   on   high .   great   quality   product   for   the   price !
junk   i   purchased   this   product   and   within   one   week   there   was   no   warm   hot   air   at   all .   only   cold   air .   save   your   money .
awesome !   i   purchased   this   dryer   on   sale   at   cvs .   i   love   the   cord   keeper .   i   just   hold   onto   the   cord   while   it   s   retracting .   the   removable   filter   is   much   better   than   other   dryers   i   ve   used ,   because   there   is   a   plastic   piece   that   keeps   lint   from   actually   getting   into   the   dryer .   this   dryer   is   much   more   powerful   and   lighter   then   any   other   dryer   i   ve   ever   used .   i   have   very   thick   coarse   hair .   with   other   dryers   it   took   me   45   minutes   to   over   and   hour   to   blow   dry   my   hair .   this   one   dries   my   hair   in   15   30   minutes .   it   leaves   my   hair   looking   and   feeling   fabulous .   it   gives   my   hair   more   volume   and   straightens   my   hair   better   than   my   other   dryers .   i   still   have   to   use   a   flatiron ,   but   it   only   takes   one   pressing   on   each   section   instead   of   several   to   get   it   to   lay   flat .   i   strongly   recommend   this   product .
received   wrong   product   ordered   2   of   the   3500 ,   but   received   the   3200 ,   which   was   a   lower   model ,   lower   priced ,   by   mistake .   somehow ,   i   don   t   believe   that .   i   feel   as   if   they   were   trying   to   see   if   i   would   notice   the   difference .   then   when   i   asked   for   an   exchange ,   they   said   they   didn   t   have   any   more   of   the   3500s .   sounds   fishy   to   me !
awesome   hair   dryer   i   tested   this   hair   dryer   at   a   ritz   carlton   and   loved   it   didn   t   even   unpack   my   own .   i   ordered   one   upon   my   return   and   have   been   using   it   daily   for   over   a   month .   my   short ,   permed   hair   stays   shiny   and   does   not   dry   out .   this   dryer   is   fantastic !   the   retracting   cord   works   smoothly ,   too .
don   t   buy   it !   i   have   had   three   t3   hair   dryers .   i   really   liked   the   lightweight   aspect   but   the   heat   control   stopped   working   on   all   of   them   including   the   travel   version .   it   is   impossible   to   use   any   of   them   because   the   the   high   heat   gets   so   hot   now   that   it   burns   my   hair .   if   i   put   it   on   a   lower   setting   the   air   is   just   less   forceful .   the   worst   part   is   that   i   contacted   the   company   and   they   didn   t   even   respond .   i   will   never   buy   anything   from   this   company   again .
powerful   very   nice   hairdryer .   it   is   a   little   heavy ,   but   you   get   used   to   it   after   a   while .   gives   a   lot   of   power ,   so   your   hair   dries   quickly .   concentrator   is   included ,   so   it   helps   prevent   frizz .   my   hair   does   get   a   little   frizzy   after   this ,   but   it   is   not   as   bad   as   with   other   hair   dryers .   there   are   3   settings   and   a   cool   shot   button .
power   handling   bought   this   after   using   one   elsewhere   has   good   weight ,   good   power ,   dries   fast ,   not   too   loud .   only   down   side ,   the   director   nozzle   falls   off   easily .   otherwise ,   a   very   good   by .   ne
hair   dryer   this   is   a   replacement   wall   mounted   hair   dryer .   i   had   one   exactly   like   it   that   i   mounted   in   my   bathroom   13   years   ago   when   we   moved   into   our   new   home .   it   is   extremely   handy   and   up   out   of   the   way .   i   never   have   to   deal   with   tangly   cords   or   plugging   it   in .   it   s   powerful   and   efficient .   if   it   weren   t   awesome ,   i   wouldn   t   have   bought   my   second   one .   you   won   t   be   disappointed .
excellent   this   is   an   excellent   value .   i   ve   owned   several   remington   products   and   have   rarely   been   disappointed .   this   is   no   exception .   it   works   nearly   as   well   as   my   very   expensive   chi   hair   dryer ,   but   for   a   lot   less   money .   it   also   comes   with   attachments ,   which   my   expensive   on   did   not .   i   wouldn   t   go   so   far   as   to   say   this   is   salon   quality ,   but   for   people   who   don   t   want   to   pay   for   salon   quality   equipment ,   but   want   to   get   salon   quality   results ,   this   will   be   an   excellent   addition   to   their   tool   set .
excellent   quality   the   fit   and   finish   of   this   product   is   excellent ,   it   has   a   high   quality   blower   fan   and   the   exterior   material   as   commented   by   a   previous   reviewer   is   designed   to   avoid   scratching   on   the   counter .   br   br   my   girlfriend   loves   this   dryer   because   it   is   powerful   and   she   has   a   lot   of   hair   which   is   difficult   to   completely   dry   and   straighten ,   although   she   did   mention   that   on   the   lower   heat   setting   it   avoids   overheating .   br   br   this   dryer   has   a   4   year   warranty   so   what   else   can   you   say ,   it   is   a   high   quality   dryer .
conair   s   customer   service   kindof   stinks .   i   had   a   hairdryer   for   over   10   years   when   i   decided   it   was   time   to   let   it   go   and   buy   a   new   one .   i   bought   the   conair   223x   cord   reel   dryer   in   august   2010   at   a   large   chain   drugstore   for   about   35 .   it   worked   fine   and   i   had   no   complaints .   i   liked   the   sassy   color   and   the   retractable   cord   feature .   i   have   super   thick   hair   that   can   frizz   in   humid   weather .   i   didn   t   see   any   improvement   in   frizz   when   using   the   dryer .   i   guess   it   dried   my   hair   quickly ,   but   i   don   t   remember   noticing   that   it   dried   it   any   faster   than   my   pervious   hair   dryer .   today   i   went   to   dry   my   hair   and   the   dryer   wouldn   t   work .   i   pushed   the   reset   button   on   the   plug   and   it   wouldn   t   reset .   i   pushed   the   reset   button   on   my   outlet   and   it   was   working .   i   tested   my   outlet   with   other   things   and   the   outlet   was   working .   the   tag   on   the   plug   said   i   should   refer   to   the   user   manual .   i   found   it   on   conair   s   website   but   it   was   not   helpful   they   actually   had   the   wrong   user   manual   uploaded   to   the   hairdryer   .   so   i   called   the   number   on   the   site ,   and   a   polite   gentleman   answered   in   less   than   one   ring .   i   explained   the   problem ,   he   asked   me   a   few   questions ,   and   then   looked   up   the   warranty .   the   item   is   under   warranty   for   3   years ,   so   i   am   eligible   for   a   new   dryer .   however ,   i   have   to   ship   it   to   conair   s   headquarters   in   arizona ,   i   have   to   enclose   a   note   explaining   the   problem ,   along   with   the   service   he   generated   for   me ,   and   then   i   have   to   enclose   a   check   or   money   order   for   3   dollars   to   cover   shipping   and   handling   of   a   new   dryer   to   my   home .   i   m   really   disappointed   that   after   only   6   short   months   of   very   occasional   use   i   was   only   drying   my   hair   maybe   4   times   a   month   the   dryer   has   stopped   working .   i   m   also   disappointed   that   i   have   to   go   through   a   rigamarole   to   have   the   dryer   replaced .   with   today   s   technology ,   they   could   easily   email   me   a   voucher   for   a   new   dryer .   they   could   also   send   me   a   prepaid   shipping   label   and   not   charge   me   shipping   and   handling   for   a   new   dryer .   maybe   i   just   got   a   clunker ,   lots   of   folks   like   the   dryer .   just   hope   nothing   goes   wrong   with   it ,   or   you   ll   be   spending   ten   bucks   to   replace   a   25   dollar   dryer !
the   best   ok   here   goes .   i   will   explain   why   this   hair   dryer   is   amazing   not   the   circumstances .   my   two   daughters   with   hair   down   to   their   but   dry   their   hair   in   my   wife   i   s   master   bedroom   bath .   they   get   up   in   the   morning   about   1.5   hours   before   we   do ,   to   go   to   school .   for   years   the   last   hour   of   our   sleep   was   inturupted   and   we   might   as   well   have   gotten   up   with   them .   this   dryer   makes   70   less   noise   drys   their   hair   in   way   way   less   than   half   the   time .   the   air   velocity   heat   is   not   matched   by   anything   out   there .   trust   me   i   have   bought   them   all ,   looking   for   some   peace   quiet   in   the   morning .   the   velocity   alone   is   triple   that   of   any   i   have   ever   seen   and   the   fact   that   at   this   air   output   you   can   still   melt   plastic   within   1   inch   .   they   drop   this   thing   every   day ,   yes   i   hear   it   even   over   the   use   noise   and   it   take   a   beating .   i   love   this   hair   dryer   even   though   i   used   it   only   1   time   it   dried   my   short   medium   length   hair   in   less   than   1.5   minutes .   with   the   other   dryers ,   twenty   plus   minutes   each   to   dry   my   girls   hair   now   twenty   minutes   maybe   total .   i   love   this   dryer   and   i   only   used   it   once .
don   t   expect   too   much   of   modern   hair   dryers   i   ve   used   hard   hood   hair   dryers   since   the   1960s .   this   hot   tools   pro   1061   is   so   light   weight   and   cheaply   made   it   hardly   stays   on   the   table .   the   only   two   settings   are   high   which   almost   burns   your   scalp   and   low   which   takes   way   too   long   to   dry   your   hair   .   also   it   s   very   difficult   to   dry   the   lower   back   of   the   hair .   i   feel   it   s   disappointing .
this   product   is   hot !   i   rarely   ever   write   customer   reviews ,   but   this   one   seemed   to   warrant   it .   here   goes   if   you   want   a   hair   dryer   that   burns   off   your   hair   and   can   potentially   make   you   bald ,   this   hair   dryer   is   for   you !   for   a   waste   of   18   21   american ,   you   too   can   be   a   21   year   old   female   with   symptoms   of   female   pattern   baldness ! ! ! !   wow !   this   little   hottie   also   turns   healthy ,   beautiful   hair   into   crispy ,   damaged   sh   even   when   you   hold   the   damned   thing   6   inches   away   from   your   head !   but   wait ,   there   s   more !   wait   just   a   few   years   until   this   baby   shoots   out   sparks   from   both   ends   of   the   body   at   6   a . m .   one   fine   monday   morning   like   it   did   for   me   this   morning   ,   and   risk   both   burning   off   massive   chunks   of   your   hair   and   severely   burning   your   right   hand   causing   a   facial   deformity   via   an   electical   spark !   yes !   the   lesson   of   the   day   is   do   not   buy   this   hair   dryer   piece   of   sh   or   any   helen   of   troy   product   if   you   would   prefer   to   keep   a   normal   looking   hair   visage   self .   their   products   are   d   a   n   g   e   r   o   u   s   c   r   a   p .
the   best   dryer   i   have   fine   dry   frizzy   hair ,   not   straight   not   wavy .   i   used   cheap   dryers   before   and   was   very   skeptical   that   any   expensive   dryer   can   make   any   difference .   but   i   was   wrong ,   this   dryer   does   make   a   difference .   with   fhi   heat   nano   it   takes   me   just   under   5   minutes   to   dry   my   hair   and   as   result   my   hair   looks   great   it   gives   volume   with   no   gels   or   mousses   ,   remove   frizz   and   make   it   straight   with   no   iron   .   highly   recommend   this   product .
nice   hairdryer   i   was   always   a   wash   and   wear   kinda   gal .   but   recently   i   had   my   hair   straightened   and   the   beautician   suggested   to   blow   dry   out   after   washing .   she   told   me   the   elchim   professional   2001   was   the   best   and   they   last   for   a   long   time .   she   had   many   years   on   her   dryer   and   it   is   used   lots   everyday .   that   sounded   like   the   best   option   for   me .   if   i   was   going   to   invest ,   i   wanted   it   to   be   good   and   have   a   long   happy   life .   it   seems   to   be   well   balanced   and   has   lots   of   power .   my   thick   hair   is   dry   in   10   minutes .   i   am   very   satisfied   with   my   purchase   and   no   regrets .   the   product   was   delivered   quickly .   i   was   suprised   that   the   dryer   was   in   a   box   with   no   packing   to   secure   it   inside .   i   thought   that   was   odd .   i   am   sure   that   it   was   bounced   around   from   the   wearhouse   and   across   the   nation   by   all   who   touched   it .   that   part   did   concern .   i   hope   it   did   not   affect   the   life   of   my   product .   time   will   tell .   but   so   far   so   good .
worked   for   awhile   i   loved   it ... while   it   worked .   it   lasted   about   six   months   before   it   just   ...   died .   first   it   quit   working   on   high   and   then   it   quit   working   all   together .   i   really   like   having   a   mounted   hair   dryer   in   my   small   space   so   i   ll   be   looking   for   a   new   one .   it   simply   won   t   be   another   one   of   these .
not   as   strong   as   i   would   like ,   and   a   bit   overhyped   by   magazines   i   know   this   was   voted   best   hairdryer ! ! !   by   like   5   beauty   magazines ,   and   it   does   seem   to   dry   hair   pretty   efficiently ,   but   this   review   applies   to   guys   with   short   hair   that   need   to   use   a   hair   dryer   to   shape   their   hair   into   styles   such   as   mohawks   or   fauxhawks   .   this   is   useful   for   you   stylish   gents   who   are   not   just   looking   for   a   device   to   merely   dry   hair .   br   br   i   find   that   the   high   setting   air   current   is   not   strong   enough   to   really   get   your   hair   into   staying   straight   upwards   if   you   re   going   for   a   mohawk   or   even   a   pompadour   and   keep   it   there   the   way   some   of   the   stronger   hairdryers   can   .   especially   if   you   have   a   thicker   hair   structure   wavy ,   curly   ,   or   your   hair   falls   naturally   in   a   certain   way   but   you   want   it   to   be   styled   in   an   opposite   direction .   using   more   hair   product   helps   a   little ,   but   a   stronger   air   current   will   work   better   even   though   it   is   more   damaging   for   your   hair   scalp ,   so   use   carefully   and   wisely   br   br   i   figured   there   are   enough   men   out   there   looking   for   just   this   function ,   so   i   figured   i   d   help   you   all   out .
worst   purchase   in   a   long   time .   this   dryer   is   deafeningly   loud ,   heavy   and   unwieldy ,   and   none   of   the   attachments   fit .   it   s   a   terrible   piece   of   machinery .   don   t   waste   your   money .
great   hair   dryer !   serves   the   purpose   excdellent .   easy   hand   held   position   compared   to   other   dryer   are   awkward   to   hold .   i   definitely   would   recommend   this   dryer   and   seller   to   a   friend .
great   product !   powerful !   i   am   glad   that   i   bought   this   product . its   powerful   and   if   you   want   you   can   reduce   the   power   as   you   wish . its   the   perfect   thing   i   was   looking   for .
boo ! !   a   real   quitter !   i   decided   to   go   ahead   and   buy   from   amazon   since   the   5   star   ratings   far   exceeded   the   negatives .   got   it   about   15   months   ago ,   and   totally   loved   it .   it   was   light   and   quiet   and   fast .   i   have   medium   length ,   super   thick ,   baby   fine ,   curly   hair .   about   a   month   ago ,   it   started   getting   louder .   then   it   just   stopped .   i   opened   it   up   and   one   of   the   blades   had   broken   inside .   i   have   never   dropped   this ,   and   it   always   goes   back   in   the   drawer ... i   even   wrap   and   secure   the   cord   every   time .   i   took   out   the   partially   broken   piece ,   and   used   it   for   a   couple   more   weeks .   however ,   its   even   louder   now ,   like   a   jet   engine   and   vibrates   ferociously .   never   again !   i   thought   i   was   buying   a   great   hair   dryer   that   would   last   me   for   years .   haha !
fried   my   fine   hair   i   need   to   replace   this   dryer .   i   have   somewhat   fine   hair ,   and   this   dryer   is   frying   it   on   the   ends .   i   m   going   to   purchase   a   revlon   tourmaline   dryer   again .   i   had   one   previously ,   which   worked   great ,   but   died   after   a   few   years   of   use .   guess   i   was   caught   up   in   how   cute   this   one   is .   if   you   have   fine   hair ,   stay   away .
very   happy   with   this   purchase   i   decided   to   buy   this   hair   dryer   after   sifting   through   consumer   reports   and   customer   reviews .   i   couldn   t   be   happier   to   have   the   quality   of   this   dryer   at   the   price   i   paid .   i   have   very   thick ,   longer   hair   that   used   to   take   me   10   15   minutes   to   get   completely   dry   in   the   past .   i   have   never   used   this   new   dryer   for   longer   than   5   minutes   because   it   dries   so   quickly   without   leaving   that   singed ,   damaged   feel   i   used   to   get   with   my   old   dryer .   the   ceramic   ionic   features   must   be   doing   their   jobs   because   it   really   lives   up   to   the   description .   love   the   retractable   cord .   i   m   very   impressed !
love   this   hairdryer   i   ve   had   this   hairdryer   now   for   about   3   4   weeks .   just   love   the   low   heat   setting   temperature   remains   comfortably   low   even   when   increasing   the   speed   to   high .   it   is   fairly   light   and   quieter   than   others   i   ve   had .
fast   dryer !   this   drys   my   long   hair   in   no   time   at   all .   i   only   use   the   medium   setting   because   the   full   blast   air   actually   blows   it   around   so   much   it   gets   tangled .   overall   it   has   a   very   nice   design ,   works   really   well ,   and   i   m   glad   i   bought   it .
a   lot   of   thick   curly   hair   i   used   this   product   once   and   i   want   to   take   it   back .   i   set   my   hair   in   medium   sized   rollers   and   i   found   that   i   couldn   t   fit   my   entire   head   under   the   dryer .   and   it   was   incredibly   loud .   i   must   say   that   i   like   the   fact   that   the   dryer   got   hot   enough   to   dry   my   hair   that   could   fit   in   ,   but   not   hot   enough   to   cause   damage .   in   order   to   get   back   of   my   hair   some   air   time ,   i   had   to   turn   facing   the   dryer   and   tilt   my   head   down ,   obviously   that   wasn   t   too   comfortable .   if   i   can   get   rid   of   this   dryer   i   will ,   but   if   not   i   will   live   with   it .   next   time   i   will   go   for   a   hood   dryer   with   a   more   circular   design ,   instead   of   the   cone   style   that   this   one   has ,   im   sure   that   ll   help   me   to   get   my   whole   head   in .
fantastic   i   know   it   s   an   obnoxious   color   but   the   bottom   line   is ,   it   works   amazingly   well .   it   s   powerful   but   not   super   loud   for   a   hair   dryer ,   at   least   ,   i   can   get   my   long   hair   dry   and   straight   in   about   8   10   minutes   on   warm   temperature   medium   strength   i   d   rather   take   a   couple   extra   minutes   than   do   extra   damage   to   my   hair   ,   and   the   settings   are   user   friendly .   before   i   bought   it ,   i   didn   t   care   so   much   about   the   retractable   cord   but   now   that   i   ve   had   it   for   a   while ,   i   don   t   think   i   could   ever   go   back !   it   s   an   incredibly   convenient   feature ,   especially   living   in   a   tiny   nyc   apartment .   i   highly   recommend   this   product .
pretty   good   i   am   a   hair   stylist   and   i   was   looking   for   a   lightweight   hair   dryer .   this   is   an   ok   hair   dryer .   it   dries   pretty   good .   a   couple   things   i   dislike   are   that   it   s   very   loud   and   the   attachment   does   not   stay   on   well .   i   will   not   use   this   dryer   on   clients   but   i   will   for   home   use .
dryer   great , , , ,   conair ,   not   so   great   i   have   no   problems   with   the   hair   dryer   itself ,   however ,   one   can   t   register   the   warranty   because   the   company   s   drop   down   menu   does   not   list   the   year   2011 .   i   sent   conair   two   emails   regarding   the   year   problem   and   neither   was   answered .   when   i   finally   was   able   to   contact   someone   on   the   phone   i   was   told   that   yes ,   the   year   was   a   problem ,   but   the   company   didn   t   have   any   answer   for   fixing   it ,   including   not   being   able   to   take   my   information   over   the   phone .   also   told   me   that   they   are   having   problems   with   the   company   which   handles   their   emails   and   none   get   answered .   perhaps   i   expected   too   much   from   conair .   next   time   i   will   seek   out   another   brand .   also   feel   that   if   one   can   not   register   a   product   for   the   warranty ,   then   amazon   should   think   twice   before   dealing   with   that   company .
junk ,   zero   stars   i   recieved   this   hair   dryer   last   night   and   this   morning   it   does   not   work .   the   heating   element   came   on ,   but   no   air .
hair   dryer   a   long   time   ago ,   this   dryer   was   in   a   favorite   hotel   chain .   i   loved   being   able   to   push   it   back   onto   the   wall   without   stopping   to   turn   it   off   first .   today ,   there   is   more   room   on   the   counter   with   the   dryer   safe   on   the   wall .   the   cord   stays   out   of   the   sink ,   too !
remington   d   2012   hair   dryer   a   bit   heavier   than   most   and   cost   a   little   more   but   but   it   is   a   whole   bunch   better   than   the   cheaper   ones .   definitely   a   good   product
hairdryer   this   product   is   awesome .   i   did   not   realize   how   bad   my   old   dryer   was   until   i   started   using   this   one .   i   can   dry   my   very   thick ,   curly   hair   in   no   time   and   control   any   frizz .
burns ! ! ! !   i   had   this   hair   dryer   for   only   3   months   before   my   hair   started   smoking   and   i   got   burns   on   my   hands   from   the   dryer .   i   will   be   emailing   revlon   immediately .   do   not   buy   dangerous ! ! ! ! !
great   product   i   love   this   blowdryer .   i   have   a   lot   of   thick   hair   and   this   blowdryer   cuts   my   drying   time   in   half !   it   s   great !   it   s   quieter   than   other   blowdryers .   i   have   used   the   diffuser ,   and   like   it   but   i   haven   t   yet   used   the   other   don   t   know   what   s   it   s   called   .
jerdon   wall   mount   hair   dryer   i   am   really   enjoying   the   hair   dryer   and   enjoy   the   wall   mount   so   it   hangs   out   of   the   way   nicely .
ok   for   short   thin   hair   i   have   thick   hair   that   is   a   few   inches   past   my   shoulders .   i   dry   my   hair   on   the   high   hot   setting .   i   used   this   for   the   first   time   yesterday   and   the   dryer   shut   off   halfway   through   the   drying   process .   i   know   it   is   because   of   the   safety   feature   that   turns   it   off   once   it   is   too   hot .   i   pushed   the   button   on   the   plug   to   reset   the   dyrer   and   it   turned   back   on   for   a   few   more   seconds   of   drying   then   shut   off .   i   turned   the   heat   setting   down   to   warm   and   was   able   to   finish   drying   my   hair .   i   do   not   recommend   this   for   anyone   that   has   thick   hair   that   takes   a   while   to   dry   like   mine .   it   does   dry   sections   quickly ,   but   not   quickly   enough   for   my   hair   type .
great   hair   dryer   first   used   this   product   at   a   hotel   in   vegas .   bought   one   for   home   and   love   it .   leaves   hair   smooth   and   retractable   cord   makes   for   easy   storage .
great   product   dryer   is   lightweight   and   delivers   a   lot   of   heat .   dries   and   smoothes   hair   quickly .   cuts   down   drying   time   down   in   half .   wont   go   back   to   standard   dryers .
great   hair   dryer   for   the   price .....   i   used   this   hair   dryer   while   staying   at   a   marriott   hotel   and   loved   it .   my   hair   dries   in   a   much   shorter   amout   of   time   and   comes   out   soft   without   the   frizz .   the   folding   handle   and   retractable   cord   make   it   easy   to   transport   and   store .   i   ordered   an   ionic   hair   dryer   from   my   hairdresser   which   was   three   times   more   expensive ,   didn   t   work   nearly   as   well ,   and   broke   within   a   year .   my   daughter   in   law   used   it   recently   and   couldn   t   believe   how   quickly   her   hair   dried ......
great   dryer   this   is   a   great   hair   dryer   but   it   dosen   t   dry   your   hair   any   faster   than   any   other   dryer   it   s   just   hype ,   so   if   you   looking   for   a   shorter   drying   time   then   look   somewhere   else ,   but   this   dryer   does   make   your   hair   super   soft ,   softer   than   any   other   dryer   that   i   ve   used   and   i   ve   tried   several   brands ,   over   all   i   would   buy   it   again .
this   is   great   ok ,   i   am   not   a   hair   stylist ,   for   that   matter   in   a   few   years   drying   my   hair   will   be   an   act   of   remembrance .   that   being   said ,   my   wife ,   the   primary   user   of   this ,   loves   this .   the   dual   heat   and   fan   controls   allows   her   to   get   just   the   right   touch .   from   my   perspective ,   this   is   well   built .   heavier   that   the   usual   hair   dryer   and   with   an   easily   removable   rear   grate   that   will   prevent   the   fan   from   burning   out   over   prolonged   use .   you   will   get   many   years   out   of   this   great   dryer !
a   superb ,   solidly   constructed   hair   dryer   this   hair   dryer   is   the   most   powerful   i   ve   ever   used .   it   actually   kicks   when   you   start   it ,   that   s   how   much   air   rushes   out   of   the   nozzle .   the   warm   air   drying   field   because   of   the   dryer   s   unusual   strength   is   wider   and   more   focused   than   any   other   that   i   ve   tried .   the   controls   are   remarkably   easy   to   use .   they   require   hardly   any   pressure ,   seeming   to   respond   instantly   when   pressed .   ergonomically   the   remington   ac2015   is   well   designed ,   fitting   in   my   hand   quite   comfortably .   other   hair   dryers   are   often   indifferently   designed ,   their   weight   soon   tiring   your   hands   and   arms   requiring   constant   switching   between   left   and   right   hands .   this   dryer   stayed   in   my   right   hand   without   cramping   or   fatigue ,   which   i   really   appreciate .   br   br   the   three   heat   settings   and   two   speeds   are   perfect   for   the   subtle   changes   your   hair   undergoes   during   the   drying   process .   there   s   a   big   difference   between   the   extremely   wet   hair   you   confront   when   first   leaving   the   shower   and   the   dryer ,   more   responsive   hair   you   have   after   a   couple   of   minutes   of   drying .   with   the   different   heat   settings   and   two   speeds   coupled   with   the   dryer   s   strength   i   manage   to   avoid   some   of   the   heat   damage   that   i   used   to   inflict   on   my   hair .   back   then ,   i   was   forced   to   crank   up   my   inferior   dryer   in   order   to   get   better   and   quicker   drying .   heat   damaged ,   overly   dry   even   dessicated   hair   is   unmanageable   and   very   unsightly .   i   am   thankful   those   days   appear   to   be   gone   for   good .   the   attachments   are   easy   to   add   and   use   though   i   never   need   them ,   finding   the   dryer   in   its   native   state   to   be   best   for   my   hair .   the   dryer   runs   quietly   and   without   sparking ,   something   that   can   be   worrisome   when   your   hands   are   moist .   there   s   a   four   year   warranty   which   indicates   the   confidence   the   manufacturer   has   in   this   well   made   dryer .   the   remington   ac2015   is   an   excellent   professional   grade   dryer   that   is   easy   to   recommend .
it   is   still   working   it   is   still   working ,   i   like   that .   i   ordered   it   up   sometime   ago   for   the   mrs .   she   s   has   made   no   complaints   which   pleases   me   so   conair   has   done   good   with   this   one .
professional   style ,   but   not   quality .   decent   value .   it   s   styled   like   a   profession   hair   dryer ,   but   it   s   not .   it   s   not   as   solidly   manufactured ,   especially   the   buttons .   the   high   heat   setting   is   slightly   too   hot ,   and   the   low   airflow   setting   seems   weak .   br   br   this   is   a   fine   mid   range   dryer   and   a   good   value   for   the   price ,   but   you   will   likely   have   to   pay   over   100   for   a   true   professional   dryer .   br   br   my   comparison   dryer   is   the   elchim   professional   2001 .   that   is   a   real   professional   dryer .
buy   from   a   place   that   you   can   exchange   easily   i   purchased   this   as   a   christmas   present   and   how   embarrassing   was   it   when   the   person   i   purchased   it   for   said ,   well ,   i   loved   it   until   i   used   it   the   third   time   and   when   i   went   to   take   off   the   concentrator   the   whole   front   of   the   blow   dryer   fell   apart .   i   guess   we   ll   see   how   highly   rated   this   seller   really   is .   he   hasn   t   responded   to   my   email   still !
fast   and   quiet   this   hair   dryer   works   fast   to   dry   hair .   it   s   quiet   in   operation   even   on   high   speed .   br   br   the   body   of   the   dryer   is   smooth   feeling ,   kind   of   soft   almost .   not   like   a   hard   shiny   plastic   feels .   it   s   a   nice   touch .   br   br   there   is   a   removable   intake   filter   allowing   a   clean   fan .   br   br   the   cord   is   long   enough   to   use   the   dryer   comfortably .   br   br   there   is   plenty   of   power   and   heat   to   dry   even   the   longest   hair   quickly .   the   added   pearl   ceramics   is   supposed   to   help   with   prevent   hair   damage .   we   ll   see .   br   br   you   could   pay   more   for   a   hair   dryer ,   but   why  
nano   blow   dryer   i   love   this   blow   dryer !   what   a   great   purchase ... you   won   t   be   disappointed .   it   makes   my   hair   shiny   and   smooth   after   using   this   blow   dryer   and   dries   fast   too .   i   highly   recommend !
five   stars   loved   it
disappointing   i   had   the   same   problem   as   other   reviews .   after   the   first   use ,   the   dryer   stopped   blowing   hot   air .   such   a   disappointment .   especially   since   the   one   time   i   used   it ,   it   did   an   amazing   job .
great   hairdryer ,   slightly   heavy ,   but   quiet   i   finally   realized   just   how   much   my   tiny   travel   hairdryer   was   damaging   my   hair   so   i   started   searching   for   a   new   one .   i   picked   this   one ,   and   i   am   very   happy   with   it   so   far .   i   use   a   small   amount   of   leave   in   conditioner   and   a   few   drops   of   a   defrizz   product   and   my   hair   turns   out   great !   the   dryer   has   a   nice   array   of   settings   i   usually   put   it   on   the   hottest   setting   because   the   others   don   t   seem   warm   enough .   the   cool   setting   works   well ,   too .   the   dryer   is   fairly   quiet ,   too ,   even   at   high   settings ,   which   is   a   huge   change   from   my   travel   dryer .   the   one   drawback   i   ve   found   so   far   is   the   weight   of   this   dryer .   my   travel   dryer   was   of   course   very   light   and   compact   so   it   s   been   an   adjustment   getting   used   to   the   size   and   weight   of   this   one .   my   arm   gets   a   little   tired   as   i   m   finishing ,   but   it   s   not   a   big   problem .   definitely   a   good   purchase !
my   old   conair   is   better   the   description   is   misleading   relative   to   heat   air   settings .   there   are   2   air   speeds   and   2   heat   settings   plus   a   no   heat   button   vs .   3   air   heat   settings .   the   air   speed ,   and   not   much   of   it ,   is   the   same   on   high   and   medium   the   heat   changes .   on   low ,   the   heat   is   the   same   as   medium   but   the   air   flow   decreases .   i   have   medium   long   hair   and   was   looking   for   a   dryer   with   three   distinct   settings .   this   doesn   t   have   them .   my   old   and   working   conair   has   only   two   settings   and   is   more   effective   than   this .   at   1875   watts ,   the   air   flow   on   this   is   sad .   perhaps   that   s   intentional   and   i   just   fail   to   understand   why   high   isn   t   very   high .   the   cool   air   button   on   the   back   is   marginally   inconvenient .   regardless ,   here   s   one   to   avoid   and   i   m   going   to   try   to   return   the   one   i   got .
js   i   needed   it   right   away   and   bought   at   target .   this   is   just   as   in   the   review   i   saw   at   amazon . com ,   not   loud ,   not   heavy   compare   to   other   ones   and   after   using   this   my   hair   became   shinier .   but   one   thing   negative ,   the   diffuser   is   too   bulky   and   useless   for   short   hair .
lasted   6   weeks ,   but   quickly   replaced   puchased   november   2010 .   i   liked   this   hair   dryer   but   it   blew   after   6   weeks .   however ,   i   contacted   the   company   and   they   replaced   it   within   about   a   week   at   no   cost .
just   what   i   was   looking   for   very   happy   with   my   new   hair   dryer   great   for   easy   drying   natural   curls .   the   dryer   arrived   quickly   and   in   perfect   condition .
warning ! ! !   fire   may   shoot   out   of   cord   handle   connection   during   use   while   my   wife   was   using   the   elchim   professional   type   2001   1500   1800w   hair   dryer   to   dry   her   hair ,   flames   yes   that   s   right   flames ,   not   sparks   shot   out   of   the   base   of   the   handle   at   the   point   where   the   power   cord   enters .   this   was   totally   unexpected   since   the   wire   and   handle   showed   no   visible   signs   of   damage .   thankfully ,   my   wife   was   not   injured .   however ,   please   be   aware   that   this   may   occur   with   this   dryer   and   could   cause   serious   injury   to   someone .   my   wife   has   had   the   dryer   for   3   or   4   years   and   has   not   abused   it .   i   emailed   elchim   to   advise   them   of   the   problem   and   asked   if   they   would   like   to   test   the   dryer   to   see   what   may   have   caused   it .   i   told   them   i   would   be   happy   to   send   it   to   them   if   they   sent   me   a   prepaid   shipping   label .   after   receiving   no   response ,   i   sent   a   follow   up   email .   still   no   response .   my   only   intention   is   to   alert   buyers   users   of   this   potential   danger   so   that   no   one   gets   hurt .
really   weak .   wouldnt   recommend   i   bought   this   hairdryer   as   an   extra   but   for   an   1875   watt   blowdryer   this   hairdryer   is   weak ! !   the   medium   and   high   settings   blow   equivalent   air .   maybe   i   just   got   a   defective   one .   i   have   a   conair   one   that   is   much   better .
andis   rc   2   hairdryer   not   made   for   the   long   haul   this   product   has   some   nice   features .   i   have   purchased   two   of   them   for   different   bathrooms   in   my   home .   i   was   surprised   when   the   first   one   i   bought   died   after   barely   passing   the   two   year   mark .   i   may   buy   another   one   just   because   i   like   this   dryer   but   i   definitely   know   what   to   expect   now .
i   m   not   picky   about   this   i   have   had   only   two   blow   dryers   in   my   life ,   so   i   m   not   an   expert   on   this .   i   just   know   it   works ,   it   s   hot   enough   for   me .   there   are   three   settings   for   the   heat   low ,   medium ,   and   high .   i   also   like   the   flat   head   it   comes   with .   i   hope   it   could   have   come   with   a   fold   able   option   cause   this   blow   dryer   does   take   up   some   space .   it   s   a   pretty   awkward   shape   to   be   stored   in   my   cabinet .   the   cord   also   isn   t   retractable ,   like   my   old   one ,   which   lasted   for   over   ten   years .   the   cord   is   short ,   but   if   you   re   just   using   it   inside   the   restroom   and   not   walking   around   the   house   with   it ,   it   should   be   fine .   i   don   t   understand   what   s   the   function   of   that   extra   button   with   the   snow   design   on   it  
great   so   far !   i   just   got   this   hair   dryer   a   few   days   ago   to   replace   one   that   randomly   stopped   working .   i   love   this   product   so   far   it   is   very   sturdy   without   being   too   heavy .   the   cord   reel   is   a   great   feature   and   makes   storage   very   easy .   the   hair   dryer   itself   works   great .   compared   to   my   last   one ,   this   dries   so   fast !   the   temperature   settings   are   also   very   nice   with   the   hot   not   being   too   hot ,   and   the   cool   is   actually   cool .   i   hope   this   dryer   performs   as   well   in   the   future   as   it   has   so   far !
greatest   blowdryer   this   is   by   far   the   best   blowdryer   i   have   ever   used .   i   ve   been   using   conair   s   yellowbird   for   33   years ,   since   i   was   13 .   after   using   the   blackbird ,   i   am   equally   impressed   if   not   more   .   my   25   year   old   daughter   is   now   a   big   fan   as   well .   i   highly   recommend   these   blowdryers ... as   i   said ,   by   far   the   best !
a   good   hair ,   day   every   day ....   i   bought   this   as   a   replacement   for   my   daughter   s   old   compact   hairdryer .   i   haven   t   used   it   myself   but   based   on   what   she   said   it   is   small ,   light ,   cute ,   not   obnoxiously   loud ,   doesn   t   get   too   hot ,   and   doesn   t   suck   her   hair   into   the   intake   like   her   old   one   did .   the   first   day   she   used   it ,   she   came   downstairs   and   said ,   either   i   m   having   a   fabulously   lucky   hair   day ,   or   this   hairdryer   is   as   awesome   as   it   s   supposed   to   be !   we   are   pleased   with   the   purchase   and   would   buy   this   item   again .
read ,   eat   popcorn   and   blow   dry   your   hair   all   at   once !   my   12   yr   old   daughter   has   long ,   very   thick   hair   and   her   arms   get   tired   when   she   blow   dries   it .   this   allows   her   to   read ,   enjoy   a   snack   and   blow   dry   her   hair   all   at   once .   it   isn   t   as   fast   as   a   hand   held   dryer   but   if   she   s   reading ,   the   longer   the   better .   it   has   air   holes   all   over   the   inside   and   works   great   for   her   thick   hair .   the   ends   of   her   hair   that   stick   out   of   the   bottom   take   a   little   longer   but   it   s   worth   it .   i   m   thinking   of   trying   it   out ...   it   was   a   little   difficult   trying   to   find   a   place   to   set   it   and   a   chair   that   was   just   the   right   height .   she   just   keeps   it   set   up   all   the   time   and   it   s   become   a   permanent   fixture   in   her   room .   definitely   worth   it .
this   hair   dryer   is   amazing !   before   purchasing   this   hair   dryer   i   read   pretty   much   all   of   the   reviews   on   the   earlier   edition .   the   ratings   were   high ,   so   i   decided   to   get   the   latest   edition   and   try   it   out .   i   wasn   t   sure   if   the   dryer   would   work   wonders   with   my   hair   type .   as   an   african   american   female   with   natural   hair ,   finding   a   blow   dryer   that   straightens   as   well   as   dries   quickly   is   always   a   process .   but   using   the   andis   is   like   a   breath   of   fresh   air !   it   takes   me   about   10   15   to   dry   my   hair   with   the   comb   extension .   and   yay   for   the   comb   extension !   i   am   so   happy   with   my   purchase   i   have   been   telling   everyone   i   know   to   get   it  
nice   but   slow   it   is   a   nice   unit .   compact   and   easy   to   use   but   it   takes   a   long   time   to   dry   my   hair .
works   great ,   night   light   is   bright   after   a   few   weeks   of   using   this   wall   mount   hair   dryer ,   i   am   impressed .   works   great ,   very   functional ,   nice   looking .   some   side   comments   are   that   the   night   light   is   very   bright   and   there   doesn   t   seem   to   be   an   option   to   turn   it   off .   also ,   it   holds   very   tight   in   the   mount   and   you   have   to   pull   it   rather   firmly   to   get   it   out .   everytime   i   do   this ,   the   base   looks   like   it   wants   to   come   out   of   the   wall ,   time   will   only   tell   it   will   probably   loosen   up   over   more   use .
too   loud !   i   ve   owned   many   cheap   dryers   30   40   and   a   few   pricier   ones   60   80   .   i   took   a   leap   and   paid   more   for   what   i   hoped   would   be   the   perfect   dryer .   it   does   the   job ,   has   a   nice ,   compact   size ,   great   cord   length ,   but   the   dryer   is   so   loud !   i   still   use   the   dryer ,   but   after   my   5   year   old   complained ,   i   stopped   using   it   on   her   hair .   it   is   simply   too   loud ... actually   look   forward   to   it   breaking   so   i   can   feel   justified   to   purchase   a   quieter   replacement .
four   times   was   not   a   charm   i   bought   this   hairdryer   under   the   impression   that   i   was   getting   some   magnificent   piece   of   equipment .   at   200 ,   this   magnificent   piece   of   equipment   starting   whistling   at   me   within   days   of   using   it .   i   went   back   to   the   store ,   and   they   kindly   exchanged   it .   about   one   week   later ,   it   began   whistling   again .   i   went   back   to   the   store   and   they   exchanged   it   for   me .   the   third   hairdryer   i   received   didn   t   whistle   until   about   a   month   of   using   it .   because   this   hairdryer   got   so   many   great   reviews ,   i   was   willing   to   exchange   it   one   more   time ,   and   so ,   i   got   my   fourth   hairdryer   in   2008 .   it   worked   great   up   until   about   four   days   ago   when   i   smelled   something   that   smelled   like   it   was   burning .   that   alarmed   me ,   but   i   ignored   it .   then   two   days   later ,   i   heard   something   pop   inside   my   hairdryer .   after   that ,   there   was   a   piece   of   something   rattling   around   inside   of   it !   i   finally   had   had   enough ,   so   today ,   i   returned   my   hairdryer   and   got   my   money   back .   my   husband   did   some   research ,   and   we   found   a   great   35   hairdryer   that   works   just   as   well ,   if   not   better ,   than   the   200   piece   of   crap   that   i   had   to   return   multiple   times .
ionic   hairdryer   my   old   dryer   broke   and   i   was   not   sure   what   kind   of   product   i   wanted   to   get .   it   turned   out   the   sedu   revolution   pro   is   the   answer .   it   feels   like   a   real   professional   dryer !   would   recommend   to   anyone !
works   well   i   have   a   bad   neck   and   muscle   spasm   in   my   left   trapizius   so   it   s   difficult   to   lift   my   left   arm .   the   blo   and   glo   holds   my   hair   dryer   so   i   can   use   my   right   arm   to   style   my   hair .   i   only   wish   that   it   could   be   left   up   permantently   on   my   mirror   with   my   blow   dryer   in   it ,   but   it   can   t .   it   has   to   be   removed   after   each   use   or   it   will   fall   down   on   its   own   it   happened   the   first   time   i   used   it .   i   didn   t   know   i   couldnt   leave   it   up   even   though   the   directions   say   to   take   it   down   after   each   use   i   didn   t   read   that   far   my   bad   .   so ,   other   than   the   hassle   of   taking   it   down   each   time   i   am   happy   with   this   product .
just   as   great   as   a   t3   bespoke   featherweight   at   1   6   the   price   i   bought   this   hairdryer   to   replace   my   200   hairdryer   that   crapped   out   on   me   four   times .   i   have   only   used   it   twice ,   but   i   am   very   happy   with   it .   i   don   t   notice   any   difference   between   the   performance   of   the   two .
the   best   blow   dryer   ever   my   mother   gave   me   this   dryer   around   15   years   ago ,   and   still   working   i   m   buying   the   same   one   since   the   electric   cord   is   acting   up .   no   questions   about   it   is   the   best   one ! !
lasted   exactly   one   year   read   the   other   reviews ... i   wish   i   had   spent   more   time   reading   them !   this   hair   dryer   lasted   1   year   to   the   day   almost .   while   it   worked ,   it   was   very   nice ....   though   the   retractable   cord   feature   stopped   working   shortly   after   purchase .   but   i   did   like   the   concept   a   folding   handle   with   a   retractable   cord .   too   bad   the   quality   is   so   poor .   strongly   advise   do   not   buy   this   blow   dryer .   there   are   too   many   reviews   like   this   one .
it   s   a   little   weak   not   sure   if   it   s   because   of   the   attachment ,   but   even   on   the   highest   setting   this   dryer   just   isn   t   that   powerful .   i   have   a   really   short   pixie   cut   and   it   s   taking   me   almost   twice   as   long   to   dry   as   my   old   cheap   y   dryer ... humm .
great   full   function   dryer   this   dryer   offers   all   the   options   you   need   and   delivers   the   good   solid   service   in   an   almost   professional   manner .   i   find   it   easy   to   use   and   very   effective   and   easy   to   move   around .   three   speeds   and   heat   levels   give   you   every   option   plus   it   has   an   ionic   mode   as   well .   for   the   money   a   very   good   purchase .
conair   hair   blower   like   this   hair   blower ,   however   i   was   not   too   happy   went   i   saw   it   at   walgreens   for   25   on   sale   as   compared   with   your   price   of   38
5   minute   blow   dry   i   have   used   the   elchim   professional   2001   for   several   years .   my   son   s   girlfriend   needed   a   hair   dryer   and   tried   mine .   she   was   amazed   as   to   how   quickly   the   elcim   dried   her   long   thick   hair .   she   had   to   have   this   hair   dryer   for   christmas   and   is   loving   the   ease   of   use .
very   unreliable   the   jerdan   dryer   has   given   us   a   broken   switch   after   just   a   couple   months   of   use   has   done   this   with   3   different   dryers   ,   i   would   not   recomend   this   dryer   to   any   one   go   for   the   sumbeam   oster   a   much   better   product
excellent   so   far ,   i   have   been   pleased   with   the   purchase .   if   that   changes ,   i   will   come   back   and   adjust   my   review .
best   blowdryer !   i   am   a   hair   stylist   at   a   busy   salon   and   i   don   t   know   what   i   would   do   without   my   t3   bespoke   dryer .   it   blows   very   hot   but   not   too   hard   so   it   dries   the   hair   without   making   it   frizz .   the   only   negative   is   that   they   re   not   made   of   the   best   quality   parts .   i   had   my   last   one   for   2   years   which   is   the   length   of   the   warranty   before   it   broke   which   for   me   is   a   good   run .   for   an   at   home   use   would   last   longer .
horrible   this   dryer   is   heavy   and   loud ,   i   would   not   recommend   it   to   anybody .   i   was   in   a   hurry   for   a   new   dryer   so   i   bought   it   at   retail   store   for   59.00 .   sooooo   not   worth   it .   and ,   the   air   is   not   hot   at   all .   it   blows   cool   air   on   the   hot   setting .   also ,   the   buttons   on   the   side   turn   the   dryer   off   while   drying .   they   were   put   in   an   awkward   spot .   hate   it !   and   no ,   i   m   not   the   one   to   sit   and   write   reviews   unless   i   feel   very   strongly   about   something .   and   this ,   i   feel   that   everyone   should   know   so   they   don   t   waste   their   money   like   i   did .
love   this   hair   dryer !   i   was   in   desperate   need   of   a   new   hair   dryer .   i   read   several   different   reviews   on   amazon . com   and   decided   to   go   with   the   remington   d   2012 .   i   am   very   happy   with   my   decision !   i   have   been   using   the   hair   dyer   now   for   a   few   weeks   now   and   have   definitely   noticed   a   difference   in   my   hair .   the   dryer   leaves   my   hair   feeling   really   soft   and   super   shiny .   it   would   be   great   if   it   was   a   little   lighter   weight   wise   but   i   would   not   say   it   is   heavy   at   all .
good   little   hairdryer   pros   quiet ,   small   and   portable ,   cute ,   works   well .   cons   needs   a   setting   that   blows   just   air   and   not   heat .
twin   turbo   bought   the   tun   turbo   to   replace   my   elchim   blowdryer   that   in   had   for   years .   purchased   the   twin   turbo   based   on   the   reviews   and   that   it   is   lighter   weight   then   the   elchim   with   the   same   power .   i   received   my   new   twin   turbo   and   i   am   pleased   with   the   wright   ,   power   and   attachments   i   am   not   pleased   with   the   fact   that   the   of   the   blowdryer   does   not   have   a   guard   like   the   chi   or   the   elchim   have   that   protects   your   hair   from   being   sucked   into   the   motor .   ouch   and   it   burns   your   hair .   basically   you   need   to   be   super   careful   and   not   rush   when   using   this   dryer   or   your   hair   will   be   ruined .
won   t   last   4   months ..   i   loved   this   dryer   for   its   small ,   compact   size   and   remarkably   fast   drying   speeding ..   so   much   so   that   i   bought   one   after   the   other ,   after   the   other ,   when   my   first   one   burned   out .   i   suspected   it   was   because   of   the   dual   voltage   aspect ,   taking   its   toll   on   the   little   guy   while   i   was   in   the   uk   and   europe .   however ,   i   started   noticing   a   pattern   when   i   bought   my   third   andis   33805   dryer   in   the   usa .   with   fairly   normal   use   once   a   day   at   the   most   and   careful   care ,   this   dryer   still   didn   t   last   a   few   months   before   it   started   getting   too   warm ,   lost   its   turbo   power ,   sparked   and   ultimately   fried .   i   guess   you   get   what   you   pay   for   and   i   m   not   ready   to   shell   out   for   andis   turbo   4 ,   despite   my   previous   love   affair .
worked   great   but   didn   t   last   this   hairdryer   was   my   favorite   one   until   it   mysteriously   stopped   working   one   day   for   no   reason .   when   it   did   work ,   it   dried   my   hair   thick   wavy   in   about   5   minutes !   i   also   loved   the   retractable   cord .   when   unfolded ,   this   is   a   full   size   hairdryer   and   it   is   weighty   which   i   liked   about   it .   however ,   it   won   t   turn   on   less   than   1   year   after   i   got   it .   i   have   had   previous   hair   dryers   for   years   with   no   problems .   this   is   not   an   expensive   hair   dryer   so   it   was   great   while   it   lasted .   i   am   giving   it   two   stars   because   it   didn   t   last .   while   it   worked ,   i   d   give   it   a   5  
misleading   color   description   i   ordered   the   elchim   professional   2001   1800   watt   classic   hair   dryer   color   may   vary   expecting   a   product   somewhat   looking   as   described   perhaps   in   different   shades   of   red   and   black .   the   hair   dryer   came   in   black   which   i   did   not   like .   it   was   returned   and   the   return   hair   dryer   was   also   black .   since   color   coordination   is   an   important   factor   in   our   tiny   bathroom   i   was   really   disappointed   with   the   product .   i   returned   both   packages   and   will   purchase   another   red   hair   dryer .   i   thought   the   color   description   was   misleading .   i   have   not   tried   the   product   so   i   do   not   know   about   its   quality .
why   didn   t   i   buy   two   this   is   just   what   a   hair   dryer   should   be .   out   of   the   way   when   not   in   use ,   easy   and   powerful .   i   just   bought   three   more ,   one   for   work   i   am   a   barber   one   for   my   other   bathroom   and   a   spare .
works   great   i   just   bought   this   dryer   a   couple   weeks   ago ,   i   really   like   it .   it   dries   my   hair   quickly   and   it   does   not   leave   my   hair   frizzy .   the   only   thing   i   would   change   is   the   on   off   button .   i   hit   that   often   causing   it   to   shut   off .
oh   how   bad   this   dryer   is   .... let   me   count   the   ways !   it   s   too   heavy ,   it   wiggles   when   you   dry   because   of   the   folding   handle ,   the   retractable   cord   is   too   short ,   it   s   noisy ,   the   buttons   are   insanely   hard   to   turn   on ,   the   cool   shot   button   is   too   easily   pushed   by   mistake   and   it   s   toooooooo   heavy !   when   you   have   long   hair   you   feel   like   you   have   been   lifting   weights   with   one   arm   for   20   minutes .   ouchie ......   do   not   buy   it !   the   people   are   revlon   need   to   go   back   to   the   drawing   board   with   this   one .

smoke   i   got   this   blower   dryer   for   christmas   after   i   had   picked   it   out   and   had   it   on   my   wish   list .   i   decided   to   make   sure   it   worked   before   i   threw   away   all   the   packaging .   as   soon   as   i   turned   it   on   there   was   a   funny   burning   smell .   i   ran   it   for   about   30   seconds   on   high   and   turned   it   off   and   smoke   came   out   of   the   barrel .   i   waited   about   five   minutes   and   tried   it   again ,   same   thing   happened .
muy   bueno   en   realidad   todo   llego   bien   y   es   un   muy   buen   equipo   lo   recomiendo   fue   una   entrega   r   pida   recomiendo   al   vendedor
disappointed   very   disappointed   with   this   product .   it   is   so   heavy   when   i   suction   cupped   it   to   my   mirror ,   i   thought   my   door   to   my   medicine   cabinet   where   my   mirror   is   located   was   going   to   break   off   its   hinges .   then ,   it   falls   off   when   i   try   to   put   my   hair   dryer   in   it .   my   dryer   fell   in   the   sink   and   broke .   it   also   does   not   fit   my   vidal   sassoon   flat   hair   dryer .   the   arm   is   very   rigid   and   does   not   allow   for   repositioning   the   dryer .   last ,   it   is   very   hard   to   store   as   it   is   so   big   and   bulky .   not   using   it   anymore .   too   inconvenient !
my   hairdryer   for   life   i   rarely   leave   reviews ,   but   i   have   used   my   new   hairdryer   4   times   now   and   i   am   amazed .   the   power ,   the   smooth   sounds ,   the   quality   and   results   are   amazing .   my   hair   came   out   so   smooth   i   thought   that   perhaps   i   put   too   much   product   in   my   hair ,   and   i   almost   thought   that   the   product   made   my   hair   a   tad   oily .   nope   that   s   just   the   natural   shine .   wow .   my   husband   did   a   great   job   when   he   overheard   me   shopping   at   bed   and   beyond   one   day   and   i   was   admiring   the   expensive   hair   dryers .   he   paid   attention   and   researched   and   voila   a   wonderful   and   very   thoughtful   christmas   present !   less   time ,   less   frustration   and   feeling   a   little   bit   prettier   in   the   mornings   is   well   worth   the   money .   thank   you   fhi !

best   hair   dryer   i   have   ever   owned   this   is   a   great   hair   dryer !   unlike   some   of   the   reviews   i   do   not   feel   it   is   heavy   , but   i   have   always   used   a   full   sized   dryer   as   opposed   to   some   of   the   more   compact   ones   out   there   in   the   market .   i   did   have   to   get   used   to   the   switch   placement   the   first   couple   of   times   i   used   it ,   and   the   nozzles   can   be   difficult   to   turn   if   they   are   put   on   too   tight ,   but   these   are   minor   adjustments   one   has   to   make   while   getting   used   to   a   new   product .   my   hair   is   noticeably   straighter   and   very   soft   since   starting   to   use   this   dryer ,   i   don   t   necessarily   feel   it   dries   my   hair   any   quicker   than   my   old   one   did ,   but   the   end   results   are   definitely   better !
hair   dryer   technology   my   first   thought   when   i   pulled   it   out   of   the   box   was   that   it   was   very   stylish .   i   love   the   pink !   it   is   very   professional   looking   indeed .   br   br   i   like   the   dryer   has   a   nice   long   cord ,   as   almost   every   dryer   i   have   ever   owned   have   had   short   chords .   br   br   this   hairdryer   is   really   powerful .   i   have   short   hair   and   the   dryer   dried   my   hair   rather   quickly .   the   two   attachments   the   dryer   comes   with   were   easy   to   place   on   and   remove .   br   br   there   are   three   heat   and   two   speed   selections .   i   found   the   highest   heat   setting   very   hot ,   but   it   would   be   perfect   for   someone   with   long   thick   hair .   the   medium   setting   works   well   for   my   short   hair .   br   br   i   have   two   minor   complaints   with   the   dryer   the   weight   of   the   dryer   is   a   little   heavier   than   i   m   use   to   and   my   2nd   complaint   is   with   the   placement   of   the   controls .   it   made   it   kind   of   hard   to   hold   and   dry   my   hair ,   as   i   was   trying   hard   not   to   accidentally   change   the   settings .   br   br   that   will   just   take   some   getting   use   to   on   my   part .   br   br   overall ,   the   remington   ac2015   tstudio   salon   collection   pearl   ceramic   hair   dryer   is   a   great   product   and   certainly   worth   the   price .

great   product   plain   and   simple   this   is   a   great   hair   dryer .   i   have   my   cosmetology   license   and   have   bought   very   expensive   dryers   in   the   past ,   with   the   same   results   as   i   ve   gotten   with   this   andis   moderately   priced   version .   i   will   seek   out   this   brand   without   hesitation   in   the   future .
great   hair   dryer   i   found   it   very   hard   to   buy   a   blow   dryer   on   line   but   after   some   research   and   talking   with   my   hair   stylist   i   decided   to   purchase   the   fhi   nano .   i   couldn   t   be   happier   with   this   product .   the   best   feature   is   the   three   heat   options .   this   dryer   really   does   leave   your   hair   looking   silky   and   healthy .   you   definately   will   see   a   big   difference   compared   to   the   cheaper   dryers .   if   you   need   to   replace   your   dryer   this   is   worth   the   money .
heavy !   hot !   useless   pick   attachment .   awful   button   placement .   review   about   black   chrome   version .   br   br   it   s   always   a   pain   buying   a   new   hair   dryer   you   re   used   to   the   one   you   had ,   annoyances   and   all ,   and   it   s   a   crap   shoot   as   to   whether   or   not   you   ll   like   the   one   you   ve   bought   sight   unseen   although   you   ve   read   the   reviews   and   are   hopeful   .   br   br   i   wanted   to   love   this   hair   dryer ,   but   overall   i   just   didn   t .   br   br   the   first   thing   i   noticed   is   that   it   is   heavy .   well ,   not   a   bag   of   flour   heavy ,   but   it   certainly   has   a   definite   heft   to   it   heavier   than   i   was   used   to ,   at   least   and   for   someone   who   needs   to   spend   a   good   30   constant   minutes   holding   it   and   moving   it   around ... it   was   heavier   than   i   d   prefer .   br   br   the   second   thing   i   noticed   is   that   the   cord   is   really   long .   i   never   gave   much   thought   to   cord   length ,   but   it   is   advertised   as   10   feet   and   i   m   sure   it   is .   i   can   t   say   as   if   i   ever   need   a   cord   that   long   in   all   my   years   using   a   hair   dryer ,   i   think   a   3   cord   would   be   plenty .   br   br   the   third   thing   i   noticed   was   that   the   attachments   are   metal   which   at   first   i   thought   was   a   bonus   because   it   meant   they   would   be   sturdier .   that   said ,   since   they   are   metal ,   they   get   hot   during   use !   surprise ,   i   know ,   right   hee .   but   when   you   re   used   to   plastic   and   suddenly   have   metal   and   you   forget   and   grab   the   end ... ouch !   also ,   the   attachments   were   a   bit   of   a   pain   to   put   on .   i   had   to   fight   with   one   of   them   because   it   didn   t   seem   to   want   to   click   on   easily   or   at   least   as   easily   as   any   dryer   i   d   used   before   .   i   did   finally   get   it   on ,   and   thought   well ,   at   least   it   will   stay   on .   unfortunately ,   that   wasn   t   the   case   with   the   resin   pick   attachment ,   which ,   in   addition   to   being   super   awkward   to   use ,   came   flying   off   the   end   in   about   seven   seconds .   the   other   concentrator   attachments   were   fine ,   but   that   pick   one   was   useless .   br   br   the   fourth   thing   i   noticed   is   that   the   button   placement   sucks .   i   managed   to   turn   it   off   at   least   10   times   in   the   first   two   minutes   of   using   it .   sooooo   frustrating .   just   grabbing   the   handle   to   hold   it   would   bump   it   to   off .   grrrrr .   i   tried   to   be   especially   mindful   of   it   for   the   rest   of   the   usage   period ,   and   i   did   get   better ,   but   i   still   turned   it   off   repeatedly .   br   br   the   fifth   and   final   thing   i   noticed   is   that   the   hot   is   really   super   hot .   i   mean ,   so   hot   that   you   do   have   to   really   be   careful   how   long   you   point   it   at   your   scalp   and   i   d   never   use   it   on   my   hair   without   putting   some   form   of   styling   protectant   on   it   first .   br   br   taking   everything   into   consideration ,   this   was   not   the   hair   dryer   for   me .   at   all .   it   was   too   heavy   minus   one   star   ,   had   hard   to   attach   and   useless   attachments   minus   one   star   ,   and   had   sucky   button   placement   minus   one   star   .   it   s   going   back . ially   mindful   of   it   for   the   rest   of   the   usage   period ,   and   i   did   get   better ,   but   i   still   turned   it   off   repeatedly .   the   fifth   and   final   thing   i   noticed   is   that   the   hot   is   really   super   hot .   i   mean ,   so   hot   that   you   do   have   to   really   be   careful   how   long   you   point   it   at   your   scalp   and   i   d   never   use   it   on   my   hair   without   putting   some   form   of   styling   protectant   on   it   first .   taking   everything   into   consideration ,   this   was   not   the   hair   dryer   for   me .   at   all .   it   was   too   heavy   minus   one   star   ,   had   hard   to   attach   and   useless   attachments   minus   one   star   ,   and   had   sucky   button   placement   minus   one   star   .   it   s   going   back .
best   hairdryer   yet   we   were   a   little   skeptical   but   this   hair   dryer   does   what   it   claims .   first ,   it   s   a   lot   quieter   than   any   other   hair   dryer   we   ve   used .   they   re   all   a   little   noisy   but   this   one   is   by   far   the   least   noisy .   it   claims   to   make   your   hair   shinier ,   too .   maybe ,   if   you   use   it   the   right   way .   we   ve   been   using   this   for   over   a   month   now   and   it   s   hard   to   tell   but   we   re   inclined   to   believe   the   hype .   overall ,   a   superb   product   so   far .
happy   customer !   i   had   the   perfect   blowdryer ...   that   was   until   i   moved .   nonetheless ,   i   was   pretty   worried   about   getting   a   new   one .   i   have   been   through   a   fair   share   of   terrible   no   good   hair   dryers .   looove   this   one !   it   s   lightweight ,   only   1.7   lbs   compared   to   some   that   are   2.5   or   even   3 !   i   like   that   it   has   a   retractable   cord ,   which   will   make   for   easier   traveling .   that   goes   for   the   folding   handle   as   well .   the   high   is   actually   really   high   powered ,   i   was   surprised .   and   the   settings   are   perfect ,   in   my   opinion   the   warm   isn   t   too   hot   like   some   i   ve   experienced   .
fhi   nano   salon   pro   2000   amazing ! !   i   highly   recommend   this   blow   dryer .   not   only   does   it   dry   my   hair   in   a   fraction   of   the   time   but   it   leaves   nice   and   shiny .   i   feel   like   i   had   it   professional   styled .   i   have   long   straight   brown   hair   so   flyaways   and   frizzies   are   usually   a   huge   issue .. but   not   with   this   dryer ...
pretty   and   professional !   the   first   impression   from   the   wife   on   this   one   was   that   it   looked   pretty   .   the   hair   dryer   actually   is   brownish   with   pink   details ,   contrary   to   what   the   pictures   on   this   page   may   suggest   black   it   has   a   very   girlie   elegant   look ,   so   the   first   impression   was   great .   br   br   after   using   it   for   a   while   you   can   clearly   tell   this   is   designed   for   heavy   duty ,   my   wife   owns   a   conair   hair   dryer   and   this   one   is   definitely   quieter   then   the   conair   one   and   more   potent .   it   is   indeed   heavier   but   at   the   same   time   slim ,   basically   it   is   not   a   big   hair   dryer   but   it   is   heavier   than   your   average   ones ,   not   a   big   deal   but   worth   mentioning .   it   has   two   speed   settings   you   can   use   and   three   different   temperature   settings .   br   br   bottom   line ,   a   very   professional   hair   dryer ,   better   than   the   old   conair   the   wife   will   no   longer   use .   additionally   an   accessory   to   give   volume   to   the   hair   is   included .
best   hairdryer   ever   i   love   this   hair   dryer   so   much ,   i   got   online   to   review   it ...   of   all   the   dryers   i   ve   owned   including   a   t3   this   one   dries   the   fastest   and   leaves   my   hair   smooth   not   frizzed .   i   m   not   saying   it   s   going   to   perform   miracles   and   turn   a   rat   s   nest   into   a   pantene   commercial   but   i   use   to   run   my   straightening   iron   through   my   hair   just   to   smooth   it   out   a   bit   more ,   and   i   don   t   feel   the   need   to   do   that   anymore .
one   powerful   hair   dryer   the   remington   ac2015   is   a   good   hair   dryer   with   a   reasonable   price   point   that   will   get   the   job   done   for   which   it   is   intended   drying   hair .   the   hair   dryer   itself   is   very   sturdy   and   a   bit   heavier   than   most   and   the   controls   are   easy   to   use .   but   is   it   possible   that   a   hair   dryer   can   actually   have   too   much   power   behind   the   air   flow   if   so ,   this   hair   dryer   would   fit   the   bill .   the   remington   is   a   work   horse   of   a   hair   dryer   that   has   so   much   power   for   air   velocity   it   was   almost   more   than   i   would   have   preferred .   it   blew   my   hair   in   just   about   every   direction   imaginable ,   and   it   blew   papers   on   the   ledge   in   my   bathroom   all   around   the   room .   so   therein   lies   what   might   be   a   potential   issue   with   the   hair   dryer .   if   you   are   a   person   who   likes   to   style   your   hair   with   the   help   of   your   hair   dryer ,   it   might   be   a   challenge   to   find   a   setting   to   do   that .   while   using   the   high   speed   setting   on   the   hair   dryer ,   with   a   round   brush ,   my   hair   tended   to   blow   around   too   much ,   and   made   it   hard   to   control   the   hair   in   the   brush .   the   low   setting   was   a   better   option ,   however ,   when   i   chose   to   use   the   cool   shot   option   to   set   the   hair ,   it   made   the   hair   dryer   speed   go   faster ,   and   blew   more   air   than   if   you   left   the   button   untouched .   i   am   not   sure   why   the   airflow   would   increase   when   you   hit   the   cool   shot   button ,   but   that   is   what   happened   every   time   i   pushed   it .   it   almost   seems   to   be   an   engineering   oversight .   anyway ,   after   a   few   days ,   i   gave   up   on   the   remington ,   for   styling   specific   challenges   only ,   and   went   back   to   using   my   tourmaline   tools   hair   dryer ,   which   i   like   very   much .   if   ever   there   is   a   time   i   just   need   a   quick   blow   dry ,   i   would   certainly   reach   for   this   hair   dryer ,   and   it   is   more   than   suitable   for   general   every   day   use .
replacement   for   same   model ,   7   years   old   i   just   bought   this   dryer   to   replace   the   same   one   i   got   when   i   was   16 ...   that   was   7   yrs   ago .   i   have   long ,   thick   i   mean   thick   hair ,   and   i   can   get   it   dry   in   5   7   mins   with   this   puppy .   it   also   keeps   static   at   bay .   my   old   one   didn   t   exactly   die ,   but   the   fan   blades   were   giving   out   and   making   a   god   awful   racket ,   and   i   ve   been   holding   out   for   months   because   i   didn   t   want   to   replace   it   with   any   other   dryer .   i   found   this   one   here ,   and   i   m   so   excited   that   i   get   to   replace   it   with   the   same   model ! !   i   can   t   wait   for   it   to   ship !
so   far ,   so   good   web   site   description   adequate   and   accurate .   delivery   timely .   mounting   straight   forward .   lo   speed   lo   heat   hi   speed   hi   heat .   both   appropriately   matched .   insertion   into   and   release   from   wall   mount   easy .   noise   level   comparable   to   other   mfgrs   units   i   ve   used   at   my   gym .   in   service   less   than   1   month   so   can   t   comment   on   durability .   does   an   excellent   job   of   making   my   lazy   crew   cut   stand   up .
great   in   a   small   package   purchased   this   for   my   daughter   and   it   works   fantastic !   small   size   but   gets   the   job   done .   plenty   of   power   and   airflow .   areal   winner !
great   hair   dryer   works   well ,   replaced   an   older   jerdon   wall   mount   that   died .   no   dangling   cords ,   and   difficult   to   drop   and   break   it !
love   it !   i   ve   owned   a   lot   of   hairdryers   in   my   time   who   hasn   t   ,   and   this   is   the   first   one   i   can   ever   recall   wanting   to   review .   i   had   to   buy   a   new   dryer   because   i   left   my   other   one   at   mom   s .   knowing   i   d   be   home   to   collect   that   one   which   came   from   a   beauty   supply   store   and   works   well   ,   i   grabbed   this   one   cheaply   at   target .   i   think   i   more   or   less   chose   it   because   it   was   cute ,   but   i   ve   wound   up   loving   it   for   more   practical   reasons .   i   very   much   prefer   it   to   the   one   it   replaced .   one   reason   is   tactile   it   has   a   nice   almost   soft   finish   that   s   comfortable   to   touch   or   hold .   ergonomically ,   it   simply   feels   right   in   my   hand .   it   s   very   well   balanced .   the   cool   air   option   works   great   far   cooler   air   esp   for   a   sustained   time   than   any   other   dryer   i   ve   owned .   the   air   opening   is   a   little   bit   smaller   than   average ,   so   it   provided   well   directed   air .   there   is   also   a   good   diffuser   included   if   you   need   to   diffuse   rather   than   direct .   provides   a   good   and   shiny   and   smooth   blow   out .   quickly .   even   on   cool   air !   the   cord   is   not   retractible ,   but   is   is   a   good   length   and   doesn   t   seem   to   tangle   easily .   i   would   recommend   this   product .

6   coil   cord   does   not   re   coil   i   would   expect   a   coil   cord   to   re   coil .   this   does   not .   it   stretched   and   re   coiled   about   50   on   the   first   try .   i   did   not   over   do   it .   i   went   about   3   feet   at   most .   i   can   tell   by   closer   examination   that   it   would   only   get   more   stretched .   what   is   the   point   of   a   coiled   cord .   i   could   simply   use   a   regular   dryer   with   a   hook .   i   had   not   mounted   it   but   had   one   person   hold   it   against   the   wall   for   placement   evaluation ... not   to   test   the   cord .   i   am   returning   this   defective   product .
excellent   product   my   family   has   used   this   product   for   approximately   8   years   daily   with   no   problems .   i   even   dried   2   small   dogs   with   it   regularly .   my   mother   in   her   70s   has   one ,   too .   it   is   light   weight   for   her   to   use .   i   no   longer   have   a   hair   dryer   or   cord   all   over   the   counter .   it   very   convenient   and   compact .   the   filaments   finally   burned   out ,   and   i   am   buying   another   one .   i   hope   they   still   make   them   when   the   new   one   stops   working .   i   figure   it   to   be   a   1.00   a   year   of   value ,   not   to   mention   convenient   nothing   to   get   out   or   put   away ! ! !
too   small   to   give   enough   power   and   may   be   dangerous   i   m   a   dad   so   hair   dryers   are   completely   foreign   to   me .   bought   this   for   my   daughter   and   when   her   mom   saw   it   i   got   scolded   as   it   s   small   enough   that   hair   may   be   able   to   be   sucked   in   causing   some   very   bad   times .   i   would   say   it   works .   she   would   say   it   doesn   t   work   well   enough .   3   5   stars   as   there   are   a   few   glaring   issues   if   it   s   not   only   for   a   last   resort .

they   tend   to   burn   out   rather   fast   at   first   they   were   very   good   but   now   they   don   t   last   very   long   before   they   burn   out .   replacements   are   sent   but   the   same   thing   happens ,   i   would   not   recommend   at   this   point .
wonderful   service   since   this   is   a   christmas   present   for   my   granddaughter ,   i   have   no   idea   how   great   it   is   but   it   has   been   on   her   wish   list   for   a   long   time .   the   service   i   received   though   was   wonderful .
she   loves   it   this   was   a   gift   for   my   wife   who   has   just   longer   than   shoulder   length ,   thick   hair .   she   really   loves   it !

elchim   blow   dryer   this   product   seems   fine   but   i   was   a   little   concerned   when   i   received   it .   i   bought   it   new   not   used   and   paid   the   new   price ,   however   it   looked   like   it   had   clearly   been   opened   and   some   of   the   packaging   was   missing .   there   were   no   instructions   to   explain   the   different   settings   and   i   don   t   know   if   there   are   any   additional   attachments .   i   have   a   little   concern   about   discount   jungle .
don   t   waste   your   money   don   t   waste   your   money ,   i   was   two   inches   away   from   a   girl   and   nothing .   i   m   in   college   and   even   in   class   it   did   nothing ,   and   i   put   it   on   right   before   class .
really   good   for   the   money   i   ve   had   this   one   non   refurbished   for   five   years   now   and   only   the   trimmer   has   broken .   i   bought   it   for   around   15   back   in   2005 .   gives   a   good   clean   shave .   i   m   going   to   try   a   newer   model   now   if   i   can   find   one   at   a   decent   price .
not   quite   the   old ,   but   smells   great !   with   my   greasy   face ,   the   original   gold   colored   acne   wash   cut   through   the   sludge   with   a   single   pump   of   soap .   this   new   version   requires   2   pumps ,   but   smells   100x   better .   i   think   the   better   smell   is   worth   the   extra   soap .
nice   bb   cream   i   bought   the   4   pack   skin79   sampler   and   of   all   the   4   items   there ,   this   is   the   one   that   worked   best   for   me .   br   br   about   me   i   am   se   asian   about   medium   toned   compared   to   most   native   se   asians   with   about   nc30   skin   minus   the   heavy   yellow   undertones .   i   tan   easily   in   summer   and   probably   cannot   use   this   product   maybe   can   if   i   have   the   right   powder   to   put   over   it ... will   have   to   try   ... though   i   would   use   it   in   winter   fall .   i   have   combo   oily   skin   and   rarely   break   out .   i   am   in   my   mid   30   s .   br   br   about   this   product   this   product   oxidizes   a   bit   when   put   on .   at   first ,   it   leaves   somewhat   of   a   greyish   cast   but   i   think   this   neutralizes   yellowish   asian   undertones   once   product   settles   into   skin .   later   skin79   gold   adjusts   a   bit   to   my   skin   color   though   i   think   it   is   a   tad   light   for   me .   i   think   longevity   is   about   3   4   hours   with   primer   so   i   put   a   finishing   powder   drugstore   brand   over   it   so   it   would   last   6   8hrs   using   a   powder   similar   to   your   coloring   will   help   make   this   skin79   product   match   up   to   ur   skin   coloring   if   you   are   about   nc30   or   more   .   i   really   think   powdering   is   a   must   for   this   product .   honestly ,   i   have   to   have   powder   for   this   or   it   wont   last   long   and   coloring   looks   a   bit   off .   it   isnt   drying ,   and   u   dont   become   oily   after   several   hours   not   quite   dewy   but   healthy   moisturized   skin   .   you   never   feel   u   r   wearing   makeup   with   this   on   even   with   primer   bb   cream   powder   .   br   br   compared   to   other   products   i   feel   it   does   brighten   the   face   a   bit   compared   to   the   other   skin79   sampler   items .   i   found   oriental   bb   gold   too   oily   at   the   end   of   day   though   loved   its   initial   dewiness   ,   pink   one   made   my   skin   look   dead   and   didnt   last   long   and   blemish   diamond   bb   cream   was   too   sparkly   to   use .   i   have   also   used   sephora   and   laura   merceir   oil   less   tinted   moisturizer   and   found   these   too   oily   and   dead   looking   respectively   on   my   skin .   laura   mercier   brand   oxidized   way   too   much   for   me   and   made   me   feel   like   i   was   wearing   a   fake   mask   at   end   of   the   day   i   even   tried   2   3   different   shades !   .   christian   dior   tm   broke   me   out   as   well   as   the   other   skin79   items   esp .   oriental   bb   gold .   br   br   this   is   a   good   product   to   be   honest ... despite   of   the   minor   negatives   above   esp .   not   matching   to   skin   color   and   lack   of   longetivity   without   use   of   powder .   i   really   think   this   works   great   with   powder   atop   of   it .   br   br   if   i   get   a   chance   will   post   comparable   pics   here   in   amazon . shades !   .   christian   dior   tm   broke   me   out   as   well   as   the   other   skin79   items   esp .   oriental   bb   gold .   this   is   a   good   product   to   be   honest ... despite   of   the   minor   negatives   above   esp .   not   matching   to   skin   color   and   lack   of   longetivity   without   use   of   powder .   i   really   think   this   works   great   with   powder   atop   of   it .   if   i   get   a   chance   will   post   comparable   pics   here   in   amazon .
good   i   put   this   product   on   around   5   am   before   i   went   to   school   it   stayed   on   most   of   the   day .   by   around   9   pm   the   winged   cat   eye   i   had   made   with   this   eyeliner   had   faded   somewhat .   then   when   i   went   to   remove   the   product   i   found   it   rather   easy .   even   though   it   is   supposed   to   be   waterproof ,   it   came   off   easily   with   a   tissue   and   some   water .   i   love   the   product   though .   very   pigmented .
aromatic   art   this   cologne   is   the   epitamy   of   class ! !   you   feel   like   a   million   bucks   when   you   wear   this   stuff   even   if   your   dirt   poor .   last   a   long   time   and   has   good   projection .   a   winner   for   sure !   when   my   bottle   runs   out   i   will   definetly   buy   more !
painful ... but   definitely   worth   it   i   m   34   years   old   and   i   have   really   sensitive ,   semi   dry   skin .   i   have   some   hyperpigmentation   from   sun   damage   and   monthly   blemishes .   i   have   maybe   had   2   facials   in   my   life   so   my   skin   was   not   used   to   such   a   high   concentration   of   salicylic   acid ,   or   any   other   kind   of   acid   for   that   matter .   i   have   used   the   product   about   4   times   now .   the   first   time   i   used   it   i   literally   felt   like   the   skin   was   burning   off   my   face .   after   the   fourth   use   it   s   at   the   point   where   it   still   burns   but   it   s   not   unbearable   and   i   can   last   the   whole   10   minutes .   although   the   peel   is   painful   it   has   definitely   been   worth   it .   i   was   afraid   i   would   have   a   lot   of   dry   skin   on   my   face   which   would   show   through   my   makeup   since   i   have   semi   dry   skin   already   but   it   honestly   wasn   t   that   bad .   there   were   probably   3   small   dry   patches   but   you   couldn   t   see   them   through   my   makeup   and   after   the   second   day   i   used   a   dry   washcloth   and   wiped   the   dry   skin   off .   my   skin   is   very   smooth   now   and   the   hyperpigmentation   is   almost   gone .   before   i   would   never   go   out   in   public   without   makeup   on   because   i   felt   like   people   could   see   my   age   in   the   condition   of   my   skin   but   now   i   have   no   problem   going   out   with   a   clean   face .   i   have   used   a   number   of   products   of   all   price   ranges   in   the   past   to   minimize   the   hyperpigmentation   and   nothing   ever   worked .   this   is   the   first   product   i   have   ever   used   with   success .   if   you   can   t   stand   the   pain   and   can   only   tolerate   a   minute   or   two   the   first   couple   times   you   use   this   product   you   will   still   see   outstanding   results .   also ,   it   says   to   use   lotion   after   using   the   peel   but   i   have   been   putting   on   toner   and   that   has   really   been   a   more   effective   way   of   moisturizing   my   skin   immediately   after   using   the   peel .   i   gave   this   product   4   starts   out   of   5   due   to   the   pain .   as   far   as   effectiveness   is   concerned   it   deserves   5   stars   but   the   stinging   is   really   unpleasant .
works   great .... instructions   need   revised   this   is   the   first   straightener   i   have   used ,   so   i   can   t   compare   to   others .   i   can   attest   to   the   fact   that   i   have   medium   length ,   moderately   curly   hair   and   i   am   able   to   straighten   my   hair   with   one   pass   at   410 ,   although   for   a   more   polished   look   i   do   two   passes .   i   am   able   to   get   two   days   out   of   my   style   without   any   signifigant   frizz .   however ,   it   is   fall   and   the   humidity   level   is   pretty   low .   my   only   real   complaint   is   the   instructions   state   to   hold   the   key   to   lock   the   buttons .   after   some   trial   and   error   i   figured   out   that   holding   the   key   actually   acheived   this .   feel   like   it   is   a   good   value .
i   love   it !   this   is   a   fabulous   top   coat .   we   use   it   at   my   cosmetology   school   along   with   opi   nail   polish   and   it   s   the   perfect   combo .   definitely   recommend   it .   i   am   notorious   for   screwing   my   nails   up   right   after   the   hard   work   i   put   into   doing   them ,   so   if   you   re   like   that ...   get   it !   this   is   a   great   price   for   it   too !
good   cover   up   i   know   others   have   poo   pooed   this   product   because   you   have   to   use   water   for   it   s   application .   i   purchased   this   product   along   with   some   of   it   s   rivals .   hands   down   this   product   was   better ... for   the   following   reasons   1   it   was   less   messy   to   apply   because   only   the   part   of   the   stick   that   is   wet   will   apply   color   to   your   hair .   2   it   dried   quickly   and   didn   t   rub   off   of   my   hair   onto   my   clothes   and   fingers   easily .   i   really   enjoyed   this   product   and   i   will   purchase   more   of   it .
very   poor   design   i   ordered   two   of   these   and   returned   them   immediately .   the   suction   cups   are   placed   too   far   apart   and   will   not   stay   stuck   on   the   tub   when   i   place   my   head   there .   if   this   problem   is   rectified ,   it   will   be   a   good   product .   i   have   used   pillows   of   this   style   for   years   with   excellent   results .   these   have   a   flaw   in   their   design   which   renders   them   useless .
amazing   flat   iron   !   this   flat   iron   is   hands   down   the   best   i   have   ever   owned .   works   fantastic   and   gets   my   hair   pin   straight   !
so   smooth   i   love   venus   dreams   body   chai .   i   have   very   dry   skin   and   use   body   chai   after   showering   and   at   night   before   i   go   to   bed .   i   particularly   like   it   for   my   feet   and   elbows .   it   is   creamy ,   smooth ,   and   absorbs   perfectly .   and   the   smell   is   divine .   just   right
mayumi   squalane   skin   oil   this   is   a   teriffic   product .   i   was   seeing   lines   road   maps !   in   my   face   and   i   put   the   oil   on   after   cleansing   my   face   and   then   cover   that   with   collegen   cream   and   bingo !   i   could   see   a   difference   in   about   a   week .   love   it !
smells   refreshing   smells   great !   goes   very   well   with   like   daytime   and   casual   stuff .   only   thing   i   have   against   it   is   that   its   refreshing   smell   reminds   me   of   soap ,   like   it   is   made   by   irish   spring .
the   perfect   tape   for   binding   sheet   music !   as   far   as   wound   care   goes ,   this   tape   is   mediocre   at   best .   the   tiniest   amount   of   sweat   or   moisture   on   the   skin   causes   it   to   peel   right   off ,   rendering   it   fairly   useless   for   holding   a   dressing   in   place .   the   one   area   where   this   tape   really   shines ,   however ,   is   in   binding   orchestral   sheet   music   parts .   the   1   micropore   tape   is   absolutely   the   best   solution   i   ve   found   for   taping   orchestral   music   parts   together .   it   sticks   just   enough   to   hold   the   pages   together   perfectly ,   yet   not   so   much   that   it   can   t   be   repositioned   without   destroying   your   parts .   it   s   extremely   thin ,   easy   to   tear   to   length ,   folds   perfectly ,   and   doesn   t   stretch   at   all .   it   s   about   as   sticky   as   masking   tape ,   but   much   thinner   and   much   stronger .   i   m   constantly   being   complimented   on   how   my   parts   are   bound ,   and   it   has   everything   to   do   with   this   tape !   stop   using   scotch   or   masking   tape   and   buy   this   immediately .   you   will   not   be   disappointed !
finally   a   hairdryer   that   cuts   down   drying   time !   the   andis   rc   2   hairdryer   cuts   my   drying   time   in   half !   i   leave   the   dryer   on   my   dressing   table   without   retracting   the   cord .   for   travel ,   the   cord   has   retracted   with   a   little   bit   of   help   but   it   is   not   a   problem .   i   first   used   this   hairdryer   at   the   marriott   marquis   in   nyc   and   knew   then   that   i   had   to   purchase   one !   a   great   value   for   the   job   that   it   does ! !
great   hair   dryer   it   s   cheap   and   it   works   what   s   not   to   love   full   power   is   pretty   strong   and   gets   my   hair   dry   within   minutes .   the   heat   is   at   a   good   level ,   not   too   hot   and   not   cold .   there   s   also   a   cool   button   in   case   you   want   cool   air   for   a   moment .   it   s   also   very   light ,   which   makes   it   easier   to   use   and   hold ,   especially   if   you   have   crazy   hair   like   i   do .   some   people   have   said   it   s   loud ,   which   is   true ,   but   it   s   not   much   louder   than   most   other   hairdryers .   i   haven   t   tried   the   attachments .   overall ,   it   s   a   good   hairdryer   and   i   would   buy   it   again .
for   the   price ,   you   can   t   beat   it   i   ve   always   been   a   fan   of   conair   dryers ,   but   this   is   the   best   one   that   i   have   ever   owned .   i   really   like   the   easy   open   lint   catcher   and   the   super   strong   air   flow .   it   takes   no   time   at   all   to   dry   my   hair   and   the   frizziness   is   greatly   reduced .   highly   recommended !
great   dryer ,   too   big   for   travel   this   was   my   first   ionic   dryer ,   and   it   dried   my   hair   very   well   and   quickly   although   i   have   short   hair   .   i   only   had   two   problems   with   it ,   but   these   were   enough   for   me   to   return   it   its   size   when   folded   up   is   a   bit   too   big   for   travel .   i   fly   frequently ,   and   the   space   in   my   luggage   is   precious .   this   took   up   about   the   same   space   as   a   pair   of   shoes .   the   cord   did   not   retract   smoothly   or   reliably .   i   would   often   have   to   pull   it   out   again   in   order   to   have   it   retract   fully .   good   concept ,   but   unfortunately   it   s   going   back !
great   to   find   a   1200   watt   hair   dryer !   i   could   not   find   a   hair   dryer   less   than   1850   watts   in   any   stores ,   so   searched   the   net   and   found   this   one .   it   s   great   and   doesn   t   blow   the   fuse   in   my   bathroom   i   have   an   older   home   with   15   amp   fuses   my   old   hair   dryer   finally   gave   out   and   it   was   also   a   1200   watt   and   now   it   seemed   like   no   one   made   anything   less   than   1850   watts .   this   is   a   wonderful   little   dryer ... a   space   saver   and   does   the   job .
disappointed   with   amazon   this   was   not   the   product   i   ordered   and   was   disappointed   that   it   cost   me   12.20   to   return   it .   i   feel   amazon   should   have   refunded   my   postage .   i   do   thank   you   for   the   timely   return   price   of   the   item   itself .   thank   you   pat   savina
the   ritz   hair   dryer   since   when   did   you   notice   how   good   the   hair   dryer   in   your   hotel   was   i   recently   stayed   at   the   buckhead   ritz   carlton   and   the   most   impressive   thing   was   the   hair   dryer .   i   could   not   believe   how   different   my   hair   was   no   friz   smooth   and   silky .   i   actually   wrote   down   the   name   and   info   about   the   hair   dryer   and   ordered   from   amazon .   the   hair   dryer   is   great .   so   good   that   i   ordered   the   flat   iron   too !   great   find   i   now   have   the   ritz   of   hair   dryers !
loved   it ,   but   it   died !   i   got   this   dryer   for   christmas   last   year ,   and   i   absolutley   loved   it !   i   didn   t   find   it   too   heavy .   it   was   quiet ,   and   my   hair   felt   great   after   drying   it .   only   thing   i   didn   t   care   for   was   how   hot   the   attachments   got   after   using .   other   than   that   i   loved   this   hair   dryer .   but   dang   it ,   in   october   i   took   it   with   me   to   tahoe   for   a   wedding ,   and   the   dang   thing   just   quit   working .   i   was   soooo   dissappointed .   i   had   to   use   those   cheapo   hair   dryers   that   the   hotels   put   in .   i   m   sorry   but   9   months   maybe   3   days   a   week   of   use   and   it   dies ! ! ! !   what   s   up   with   that   if   it   had   not   died   in   such   a   critical   moment ,   i   would   have   given   5   stars .
frizz   free !   finally   a   blow   dryer   that   leaves   my   hair   frizz   free .   i   ve   tried   babyliss   pro   cermaix   not   impressed !   and   other   drug   store   blow   dryers   with   the   ion   feature .   i   have   frizzy ,   thick ,   coarse   hair   and   a   lot   of   it .   before   blow   drying   i   put   garnier   leave   in ,   chi   silk   infusion ,   and   a   heat   protectant   in   my   hair .   my   hair   is   left   smooth   and   for   once   not   poofy   and   frizzy .   i   love   it !   but   i   don   t   think   this   cuts   out   on   my   dry   that   much .
salon   type   dryer   for   home   use   i   purchased   my   previous   dryer   from   my   stylist   but   it   was   so   heavy   i   quit   using   it .   the   pearl   ceramic   dryer   has   the   same   features   but   is   considerably   lighter   and   works   wonders   with   my   naturally   curly   hair .   it   dries   my   hair   really   quickly   and   that   is   what   we   use   them   for ,   especially   in   southern   humidity !   both   the   diffuser   and   the   air   concentrator   are   useful   for   various   styles .   i   use   a   little   wax   mousse   and   presto !   i   highly   recommend   it .
excellent   hair   dryer   easy   to   mount   5   stars   super   easy   to   mount .   great   the   cord   does   not   coil   because   it   would   get   tangled   easily .   a   tad   bit   noisy   but   that   s   what   a   hair   dryer   is ,   loud .   i   recommend   to   all .
sturdy   and   light   yes ,   this   looks   like   a   hair   dryer   from   a   hotel   and   i   wouldn   t   be   surprised   if   a   lot   of   hotels   used   this .   it   s   well   built   and   light   weight .   nothing   fancy   on   off ,   high   low   air   and   heat .
andis   hair   dryer   this   is   a   great   hair   dryer   that   styles   my   hair   well   and   reduces   frizz   flyaways .   it   s   2   heat   settings ,   plus   cool   blast   button   enable   me   to   round   brush   my   hair   even   when   it   s   almost   dry .   my   only   complaint   is   that   the   buttons   are   in   a   weird   place   so   i   accidently   hit   the   hot   warm   switch   or   turn   it   off   while   drying   my   hair .
good   stuff   this   dryer   is   great   especially   for   the   price .   easy   to   mount .   two   settings   high   is   hot   and   blows   hard   and   low   is   significantly   cooler   and   blows   rather   soft .   i   am   not   a   real   glam   girl   so   the   settings   work   for   me .
hair   dryer   the   dryer   works   just   fine   but   the   switches   are   ill   designed .   the   switches   are   located   in   an   awkward   position .   first   the   blue   cool   button   is   where   your   fingers   rest   so   when   you   are   drying   hair   and   easily   rest   your   fingers   on   the   cool   button ,   you   blast   the   dryer   on   the   cool   setting .   this   is   very   annoying   and   you   have   to   get   used   to   not   pressing   this   button .   second   in   order   to   turn   on   off   the   dryer   and   turn   the   setting   to   how   you   want ,   you   have   to   get   used   to   doing   it   from   an   awkward   position   in   the   back   of   the   handle   where   your   fingers   are   holding   the   dryer .   once   you   get   used   to   it ,   it   s   not   a   big   deal ,   but   it   s   constantly   annoying   trying   to   turn   on   off   the   dryer   from   this   position .   the   power   of   the   dryer   is   great   it   s   powerful   and   the   dryer   works   well   but   i   wish   the   buttons   were   designed   better   so   that   i   didn   t   always   hit   the   cool   button   and   that   the   on   off   switch   were   easier   to   turn   the   blower   on   and   off .
keeps   frizz   away ,   but   takes   forever   to   dry   my   hair   while   this   dryer   does   a   nice   job   of   keeping   frizz   away ,   it   takes   forever   to   dry   my   thick ,   shoulder   length   hair   with   it .   even   when   i   ve   used   the   highest   settings   on   it ,   it   takes   me   twice   as   long   to   dry   my   hair   with   this   remington   than   it   does   with   my   asin   b003521ca2   conair   259   infiniti   pro   ac   motor   styling   tool ,   orange   .   i   have   wavy   curly   hair ,   so   i   usually   use   a   diffuser ,   but   i   ve   tried   this   both   with   the   diffuser   and   without   it ,   and   each   time   it   s   taken   me   awhile   to   dry   my   hair .   br   br   some   other   pros   of   this   dryer   are   that   it   has   a   nice   feel   to   it   the   material   that   it   s   made   out   of   has   a   pearlescent ,   matte   finish   ,   isn   t   too   heavy   so   your   arm   doesn   t   get   too   tired   while   holding   it   ,   and   comes   with   some   nice   attachments .   the   diffuser ,   though ,   has   prongs   that   are   asymmetrical   in   length ,   so   it   takes   awhile   to   get   used   to   using   it .   br   br   since   many   of   the   other   reviews   are   glowing   and   say   that   this   dryer   dries   in   record   time ,   i   m   wondering   if   i   received   a   defective   unit .   as   i   mentioned ,   it   does   cut   down   on   frizz ,   but   i   prefer   my   conair   for   a   faster   drying   time .
fooled   again   this   is   the   third   andis   hangup   hairdryer   i   have   bought   and   the   problem   is   the   same   in   each   one ,   the   switch !   i   just   bought   this   last   one   less   than   a   month   ago   and   the   on   off   switch   is   already   giving   me   trouble .   this   will   definitely   be   the   last   one   regardless   of   its   convenience .
love   it !   this   hairdryer   does   what   it   says   it   does .   dries   my   hair   fast   leaving   it   smooth   and   shiny ,   quieter   than   my   last   dryer ,   and   styles   my   hair   well .   i   like   the   different   heat   settings   because   i   use   it   to   dry   my   dog   and   she   needs   a   low   heat   blow   dry .   i   would   recommend   it .
efficient   and   compact   hair   dryer   the   folding   handle   and   the   retractable   cord   make   this   a   great   travel   dryer .   plenty   of   power   and   yet   easy   to   store .   definitely   a   good   buy .   have   used   it   for   about   6   months   and   works   great .   br   2013   still   going   strong   the   retractable   cord   is   not   retracting   as   well   as   it   previously   did   but   the   dryer   unit   works   perfectly .
a   great   improvement   over   older   hair   dryers   i   have   to   admit ,   as   a   guy   with   short   hair ,   i   do   not   use   a   hair   dryer   very   often .   however ,   i   am   all   too   familiar   with   the   noise   they   make   when   my   wife   is   drying   her   hair   in   the   morning .   to   me ,   her   10   year   old   hair   dryer   sounds   like   a   mini   jet   engine .   i   asked   her   to   give   this   hair   dryer   a   try .   br   br   the   first   thing   i   noticed   is   that   the   hair   dryer   did   not   wake   me   up   in   the   morning   when   my   wife   was   drying   her   hair .   the   hair   dryer   does   not   have   that   high   pitch   noise   that   makes   it   sound   like   a   jet   engine .   it   makes   a   noise   that   i   have   not   heard   in   a   hair   dryer   before .   i   would   call   it   more   of   a   low   roar   versus   the   high   shriek   of   the   older   models .   br   br   my   wife   was   very   impressed   with   the   effectiveness   of   the   dryer .   she   said   that   it   dried   her   hair   in   about   half   the   time   as   her   old   dryer .   br   br   the   dryer   does   feel   like   it   was   build   solid .   the   outside   casing   has   a   rubbery   type   feel   as   opposed   to   the   hard   smooth   plastic   most   dryers   are   made   of .   br   br   my   wife   is   thrilled   with   how   fast   it   dries   her   hair .   personally ,   i   love   the   fact   that   it   is   quiet   and   doesn   t   wake   me   up   in   the   morning   when   she   dries   her   hair   i   work   the   graveyard   shift   so   this   is   important   to   me   .   so   far ,   this   is   an   excellent   product   and   i   would   not   hesitate   to   recommend   it   to   anyone .
great   for   a   while   mine   worked   fine   for   a   while .   i   ve   had   it   about   a   year   but   i   didn   t   use   it   all   that   much   until   about   a   2   months   ago .   after   about   a   month   the   little   plastic   piece   that   you   push   to   retract   the   cord   broke   so   now   no   retractable   cord .   i   liked   that   feature   for   easy   storage .   so   far   everything   else   still   works .   i   ll   keep   you   posted .
love   the   retractable   cord   bought   this   as   a   replacement   for   an   earlier   version   of   the   same   thing .   the   button   that   you   press   to   start   the   cord   retraction   is   placed   at   the   widest   part   of   the   unit   by   necessity   and   it   got   shaved   off   when   closing   the   vanity   drawer   so   i   could   no   longer   retract   the   cord .   other   than   this   inherent   drawback ,   i   love   that   the   cord   retracts   for   safety   neatness   space   saving ,   etc .   dries   efficiently   without   being   smoking   hot .
sorry ,   but   it   really   did   blow   us   away   i   gave   this   dryer   to   the   missus   to   try ,   since   she   uses   one   everyday   and   tears   through   one   or   two   a   year .   i   figured   she   d   be   the   perfect   person   to   rate   this   against   a   number   of   other   dryers .   here   s   what   she   said   br   br   first   of   all ,   this   hair   dryer   looks   sleek   chocolate   brown   with   powder   pink   accents   and   it   doesn   t   look   bad   or   distracting   just   sitting   by   the   sink   or   on   the   dresser .   some   huge   salon   models   that   look   like   they   power   wind   tunnels   are   much   more   obtrusive .   this   one   is   rather   long   and   slightly   heavier ,   however ,   than   the   con   air   infinity   hair   dryer   i   ve   been   using ,   so   it   took   a   little   getting   used   to   the   heft .   the   noise   level   is   average   the   same   as   con   air   ,   but   it   dries   my   hair   much   faster   and   seems   like   it   gives   more   volume   to   my   hair .   the   speed   also   allows   me   to   style   my   hair   better   and   it   stays   that   way   longer .   while   most   blow   dryers   have   multiple   settings ,   this   remington   really   has   noticeable   differences   between   the   settings ,   with   warm   being   warm   and   hot   actually   being   hot   instead   of   a   little   warmer .   the   selection   switches   on   this   model   are   also   much   easier   to   change   to   get   to   those   settings ,   and   unlike   most   slide   switch   type   models ,   they   can   be   changed   on   the   fly   while   styling   without   having   to   fumble   and   fret   with   the   dryer .   no   doubt   about   it ,   i   m   completely   satisfied   with   this   dryer .   br   br   so   of   course ,   we   give   it   five   stars .
the   best   the   is   one   of   the   best   blow   dryer   ever ,   i   lov   it   i   would   recomended   it   to   everyone ... try   it   you   too   will   love   it ! ! !
don   t   want   it   anymore   i   had   a   conair   hair   dryer   for   about   10   years   before   it   died   on   me   a   few   weeks   ago .   i   decided   on   this   revlon   hair   dryer   for   features   including   the   retractable   cord   and   folding   handle   among   others .   seemed   like   a   great   price   for   a   decent   hair   dryer .   it   dries   my   hair   fine   but   i   cannot   stand   the   on   off   switches .   they   don   t   slide   up   and   down   easily   and   i   often   have   to   wedge   something   underneath   the   slide   to   get   it   to   turn   on .   drives   me   nuts .   i   don   t   recommend   this   dryer   for   that   reason .
love   it ! ! !   couldn   t   be   happier   with   my   purchase .   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   to   replace   one   that   i   borrowed   from   a   friend   that   burnt   out   because   i   used   the   electric   converter   incorrectly .   because   the   price   was   so   reasonable   and   because   i   had   to   reach   25   for   free   shipping ,   i   bought   two   and   kept   one   for   myself .   i   use   this   dryer   every   day   and   couldn   t   be   happier   with   it .   my   hair   is   somewhat   long   little   below   shoulders   and   this   dryer   is   light ,   powerful ,   and   drys   my   hair   quickly .   it   would   make   a   terrific   travel   dryer .   it   works   much   better   than   those   found   in   most   hotel   rooms .   at   this   price   you   can   t   go   wrong .   the   fact   that   it   has   the   dual   voltage   is   a   nice   plus .
jerdon   wall   mount   hair   dryer   i   purchased   this   product   in   an   effort   to   organize   the   bathroom   in   my   motorhome .   it   keeps   things   at   easy   reach   without   falling   all   over   the   place   when   we   re   moving ,   or   taking   up   the   minimal   cupboard   space   in   an   rv !   it   definitely   satisfies   all   my   criteria .   it   s   small ,   powerful ,   and   easily   mounted   in   the   tight   space   i   had   reserved   for   it .   i   wouldn   t   hesitate   to   recommend   this   dryer   to   anyone ,   and   especially   to   anyone   looking   to   organize   a   bathroom   that   might   be   somewhat   spacially   challenged !
great ,   professional   strength   blowdryer   the   hair   dryer   has   a   number   of   settings   and   will   allow   you   to   have   very   cool   air   or   very   hot   air .   it   is   quite   powerful   and   gets   my   long   hair   dry   in   less   time   than   other   dryers   i   have   had   in   the   past .   it   is   a   little   heavy   and   i   definitely   would   not   refer   to   it   as   compact   it   s   about   the   same   size   as   a   standard   dryer   you   might   get   at   a   drug   store   and   it   s   heavier   as   well .   overall ,   i   m   very   pleased   with   it   and   hope   it   lasts   a   very   long   time .
winner   i   installed   this   little   hair   dryer   because   i   was   tired   of   the   hair   dryer   and   cord   laying   on   my   sink   and   counter   it   always   seemed   to   be   in   the   way .   my   concerns   that   this   hair   dryer   was   not   powerful   enough   turned   out   to   be   for   naught .   excellent   hair   dryer ,   plenty   of   power   and   a   lower   setting   for   those   who   like   to   take   twice   as   long   with   their   hair   like   my   gf   .   easy   to   mount   love   the   hook   to   hang   the   cord   on .
couldn   t   be   happier   with   the   blackbird !   i   bought   the   conair   blackbird   to   replace   a   similar   older   model   that   i   had   for   many   years .   i   know   that   there   a   lot   of   new   tech   hair   dryers   out   there .   for   my   needs   i   didn   t   need   the   new   technology .   i   wanted   to   replace   my   old   conair   with   a   powerful   and   modern   version   of   the   original .   i   m   very   pleased   with   the   blackbird .   i   m   a   male   and   only   blow   dry   my   hair   a   couple   of   times   a   week .   i   don   t   have   to   use   the   hottest   setting   and   get   great   results   at   a   lesser   heat   level .   the   higher   heat   settings   would   be   perfect   for   a   woman   with   long   hair .   this   hair   dryer   is   very   powerful   and   i   do   a   lot   of   styling   on   the   cool   setings   as   well .   this   is   the   first   time   i   ve   reviewed   a   product ... i   m   so   pleased   with   the   blackbird   that   i   wanted   to   share .   starlight
andis   hangup   1600   w   i   ve   been   using   these   powerful   little   dryers   about   15   years   because   they   fit   nicely   on   the   side   of   my   vanity   under   an   extended   countertop .   the   only   problem   is   that   they   only   last   about   1   1   2   to   2   years   with   2   people   using   them   daily   but   the   price   is   right .
love   my   conair   225rx   hair   drier   i   really   am   very   pleased   with   my   purchase   of   the   conair   225rx   tourmaline   ceramic   1875   watt   hair   drier .   it   dries   my   daughter   s   long   thick   hair   much   faster   than   my   old   drier .   it   produces   a   nice   strong   hot   breeze ,   yet   it   doesn   t   get   too   hot   that   she   complains   of   it   burning   her   on   lower   heat   seting   .   her   hair   seems   shinier   too .   whole   family   loves   it ! ! !   highly   recommend   it .   the   price   was   reasonable   also ! ! !
great   product   i   was   looking   for   something   compact   and   light   weight   and   this   was   smaller   than   i   expected   it   to   be !   does   a   great   job   in   drying   my   hair   quickly .   the   high   mode   is   a   bit   loud   but   if   you   don   t   want   to   use   high ,   the   low   option   works   good   too .
a   big   watse   of   money   purchased   this   dryer   2   months   ago   and   it   started   to   make   a   humming   noise   about   a   week   ago   and   within   a   day   is   was   not   working .   seems   to   me   this   must   have   been   a   refurbished   hair   dryer   because   i   have   my   old   one   that   i   purchased   from   qvc   3   years   ago   and   it   is   still   in   perfect   working   condition .   don   t   waste   your   money   ordering   from   this   vendor .   something   is   not   right   that   it   worked   for   only   a   short   amount   of   time   but   long   enough   that   i   am   unable   to   return   it .   this   is   one   very   disatisfied   customer .   if   i   could   have   given   it   no   stars   i   would   have   done   so .
excellent   hair   dryer   i   ve   only   had   this   hair   dryer   about   a   month   but   so   far   it   is   excellent .   it   is   very   powerful   and   dries   my   long   hair   complete   with   styling   it   in   under   10   minutes !   my   only   complaint   is   the   location   of   the   on   off   switch   as   it   s   easy   to   accidentally   turn   it   off   while   using   it .
pleased   as   punch   my   hair   dresser   first   started   me   on   a   t3   about   4   years   ago .   i   loved   it .   when   it   began   to   loose   power ,   i   found   another   t3   on   amazon   and   am   still   a   t3   fan .   i   highly   recommend   this   blow   dryer   well   worth   the   money .
not   a   good   hair   dryer .   after   few   minutes   on   ,   shut   off   ,   and   it   seen   not   to   blow   enough   hot   air   to   dry   the   hair .   and ,   the   attachments   are   not   good   quality .
wall   hair   dryer   the   product   works   very   well   and   is   priced   modestly .   i   like   having   it   mounted   on   the   wall   and   then   it   isn   t   on   the   counter .   it   has   three   heat   settings   and   two   speeds .   this   is   the   second   jerdon   wall   mount   hair   dryer   i   have   purchased .
i   will   never   use   another   hair   dryer ! !   i   gave   this   hair   dryer   to   my   mom   last   christmas .   it   is   the   best   i   have   ever   used .   i   don   t   even   use   my   hair   dryer   anymore   because   i   love   this   dryer   so   much !   it   dries   my   hair   in   what   feels   like   1   minute .   it   has   three   heat   settings   instead   of   two ,   which   is   nice .   this   is   probably   better   than   the   hair   dryer   my   hair   dresser   uses   in   her   salon !   i   highly   recommend   this ! ! !
gets   the   job   done !   i   purchased   this   bonnet   hair   dryer   at   a   fabulous   price   and   overall ,   it   meets   my   needs .   it   heats   up   very   quickly   and   is   quite   powerful   for   such   a   compact   size .   mine   does   not   shut   off   automatically ,   as   some   have   stated .   the   only   complaint   that   i   have   is   the   bonnet   would   not   fit   over   my   rollers ,   no   matter   what   i   did   to   adjust   it .   i   ended   up   having   to   use   the   bonnet   from   my   old   lazy   dazy   dryer .   the   hose   is   also   a   bit   difficult   to   wind   up   and   store   in   the   unit .   by   the   way ,   conair   is   very   good   at   replacing   defective   products   if   you   contact   a   customer   service   supervisor   by   phone .   i   love   this   compact   hair   dryer !
do   not   recommend   i   had   the   t3   hairdryer   for   less   than   4   weeks   and   it   completely   stopped   working .   this   is   my   second   t3   hairdryer .   my   first   one   lasted   two   years .   it   is   disappointing   since   this   was   top   rated   in   many   magazines .
cheap   knock   off ,   don   t   buy !   the   reason   the   price   is   so   low   is   that   this   is   a   cheap   knock   off   and   not   a   real   bespoke   labs   blow   dryer .   mine   stopped   working   after   9   mths   and   there   is   no   warranty .   you   get   what   you   pay   for   i   guess .
super   dryer   this   is   for   all   you   dog   bathers .   i   wanted   a   dryer   that   would   match   some   of   the   over   priced   professional   pet   dryers .   this   is   perfect .   it   blows   very   fast   or   slow .   it   s   also   very   lightweight .   on   cool   and   warm   it   s   not   too   hot .   and   it   s   very   quiet   compared   to   all   of   the   dryers   i   ve   ever   used .   so   if   you   re   looking   for   a   dryer   for   your   dog   or   cat ,   you   won   t   be   disappointed .   and   if   you   happen   to   need   it   for   you   re   own   hair   it   s   just   fine .
andis   rc   2   ionic   1875w   ceramic   hair   dryer   i   really   liked   the   cord   retractor   and   the   ability   to   fold   the   handle   for   storage .   it   also   worked   very   well   to   dry   hair .   however ,   it   did   not   last   nearly   as   long   as   it   should   have   only   a   few   months   before   the   cord   stopping   retracting   and   less   than   a   year   before   it   burnt   up .
basically   it   s   good   basically   it   s   good ,   but   you   can   buy   a   bigger   one   at   the   same   price   at   drug   store
dangerous   fire   hazard   i   purchased   this   dryer   a   little   over   a   year   ago ,   and   have   used   it   almost   daily   to   dry   my   hair   after   showering .   i   was   very   happy   with   the   dryer ,   as   it   was   powerful   and   offered   a   reasonable   selection   of   temperatures .   i   exercised   proper   care   for   the   dryer   and   never   abused   it .   however ,   friday   morning   i   turned   the   dryer   on ,   and   since   it   is   getting   cold ,   i   decided   to   use   high   heat   instead   of   medium   heat   like   i   almost   always   choose .   after   just   a   few   moments   there   came   a   hot ,   nasty   smelling   smoke   jetting   out   from   behind   the   power   switch .   i   unplugged   the   dryer   and   have   not   plugged   it   back   in   since .   br   br   i   went   to   target   to   find   a   replacement ,   and   was   disappointed .   none   of   them   performed   as   well   as   this   one .   but   i   m   afraid   to   buy   another .   what   has   the   world   come   to   when   you   can   t   even   buy   a   decent   hair   dryer   for   less   than   75   unless   you   re   willing   to   accept   this   kind   of   crappy   workmanship   i   guess   the   solution   is   to   buy   them   in   quantity   and   treat   them   as   disposable .   br   br   if   it   didn   t   perform   so   well   when   it   wasn   t   producing   smoke   and   fire   then   i   d   give   it   the   minimum   score ...   but   since   it   really   does   work   nice ,   i   ll   give   it   two   stars .   buy   more   than   one ,   and   don   t   let   them   run   unattended .

big   blower   tried   this   hair   dryer   in   a   high   class   hotel .   loved   the   power   of   the   blower .   for   some   reason   the   blowers   on   name   brand   hair   dryers   i   have   gotten   in   the   past   are   weak   and   it   takes   longer   than   it   should   to   dry   my   hair .   inspite   of   its   smaller   size ,   it   packs   a   lot   of   punch .   and   the   folding   and   retractable   cord   feature   is   a   nice   added   bonus .   the   only   complaint   would   be   the   location   of   the   release   button   for   the   retractable   cord .   it   s   in   an   awkward   loaction   on   the   body   of   the   dryer   but   i   suppose   that   couldn   t   be   helped .   in   any   event ,   its   a   very   minor   complaint .   if   you   are   in   the   market ,   i   would   highly   recommend   this   hair   dryer .
simple   and   compact   hair   dryer   i   like   the   simple   design   and   compact   size   of   this   hair   dryer .   only   the   low   heat   switch   of   the   hairdryer   was   burned   out   the   first   time   i   turned   it   on .   the   replaced   hairdryer   is   working   so   far   so   good .
failed   at   turn   on   we   purchased   two   oster   wall   mounted   hair   dryers ,   model   76932   710s   and   they   failed   right   out   of   the   box .   both   units   made   a   squealing   noise   and   were   throwing   sparks   out   of   the   fan .   customer   service   at   oster   will   replace   the   units   but   after   reading   reviews   of   this   model   on   other   suppliers   web   sites ,   i   am   asking   for   a   refund   or   credit .   the   useful   life   as   determined   by   the   other   reviews   is   between   0   to   3   months .
great   drier   for   all   the   reviewers   who   complained   about   cold   air .   please   press   the   blue   cold   air   button   once   to   enable   hot   air .   my   drier   also   came   with   the   blue   button   on ,   but   once   i   got   it   off ,   it   worked   great .   the   time   i   spend   drying   my   hair   has   decrease   considerably !   this   drier   is   very   powerful   and   does   a   great   job .
great   product   the   hair   dryer   works   very   well   to   dry   hair   fast   without   harsh   heat .   you   can   see   the   difference   in   stying   compared   to   a   traditional   hair   dryer .
professional   at   amateur   price   my   stylist   recommended   this   model   to   me .   she   s   used   them   and   others   in   salons   for   many   years   and   mentioned   this   one   as   a   sound   hair   dryer .   i   needed   one   at   school   after   i   started   growing   my   hair   out   again ,   so   i   looked   online   for   this   model .   pros   classic   design   substantial   housing   has   the   potential   to   last   years   multiple   heat   settings   and   fan   speeds   longer   cord   than   most   8   feet   instead   of   6   feet   low   noise   more   like   a   whoosh   than   a   wine   shouldn   t   wake   neighbors   if   you   re   in   a   dorm   apartment   situation   cons   heat   settings   are   distinctive   but   not   straightforward   nor   precise   overall ,   i   feel   like   i   got   a   very   good   product   at   a   great   price .   i   would   buy   it   again ,   though   not   if   it   doesn   t   last .   i   ve   only   had   it   for   two   days   and   it   seems   to   be   doing   well .
straightens   my   hair   in   1   2   the   time   i   have   always   had   difficulty   using   the   round   brush   and   a   normal   hair   dryer   to   straighten   my   hair .   my   arms   would   get   so   tired .   with   the   andis   82105   ceramic   ionic   styler   hair   dryer ,   i   am   able   to   make   my   spiral   curl   hair   straight   in   1   2   the   time   that   it   used   to .   i   have   been   getting   so   many   compliments   on   my   hair   since   i   bought   it !
great   dryer   this   dryer   works   really   well ,   just   like   the   ones   in   salons .   it   can   get   hot   in   there ,   but   its   the   same   hotness   you   would   experience   in   a   salon .   heat   can   be   controlled   by   how   deep   you   stick   your   head   in   there .   cord   does   get   a   little   warm ,   but   this   doesn   t   seem   to   be   any   type   of   safety   issue .   this   dryer   makes   it   so   that   you   can   easily   watch   tv   or   read   a   magazine   while   drying   your   hair .   i   use   them   for   my   dreadlocks   and   it   works   great ! !
good   blow   dryer ,   but   .....   the   heat   stopped   working   after   a   few   months   from   buying   it .   i   have   long   and   thick   hair ,   and   the   blow   dryer   dried   my   hair   in   20   minutes   ...   smooth   with   no   frizz .   i   loved   it .   i   didn   t   even   need   to   use   the   straightener .   before   the   andis   1875 ,   i   was   using   a   cheap   blow   dryer ,   and   it   lasted   a   lot   longer   than   the   andis ,   and   i   washed   my   hair   every   other   day .   after   i   bought   the   andis ,   i   was   washing   my   hair   every   3rd   day ,   and   it   crapped   out   on   me   after   a   few   months .   i   would   not   recommend   buying   this   blow   dryer .  
two   months   old   and   2   of   the   3   speeds   quit !   i   ordered   this   hair   dryer   the   begining   of   august   2010   and   it   now   only   works   on   low   speed .   my   box   is   long   gone   in   the   garbage   and   it   is   past   my   return   refund   date .   help !
turbo   the   heat   and   power   is   good ,   but   in   keeps   shutting   off   in   certain   outlets   of   the   house .
good   travel   hair   dryer   works   in   europe   bought   this   to   take   with   me   to   europe .   have   used   it   over   there   twice   now .   its   nice   and   small   and   works   well .   wish   the   handle   folded ,   but   its   so   small   it   doesn   t   take   up   much   space .   you   need   a   flat   head   screw   driver   or   something   similiar   to   change   the   voltage   when   you   travel .
fire   hazard   i   had   this   hair   dryer   for   less   than   1   year .   the   other   day   it   starting   shorting   out   and   then   suddenly   sparks   starting   flying   out   of   the   spot   where   the   cord   enters   the   handle   of   the   dryer ,   melting   part   of   the   cord .   fortunately ,   nothing   caught   fire !   i   replaced   the   dryer   with   a   non   revlon   product .
great   product   i   bought   this   blow   dryer   for   my   camper .   it   is   perfect .   it   s   compact ,   hangs   on   the   wall ,   not   loud   and   does   the   job .   i   would   recommend   this   product   for   campers ,   boats ,   etc .   i   will   buy   another   when   i   burn   this   one   out .   a   girl   s   hair   still   has   to   look   good ,   even   when   you   re   camping !
works   well   switches   in   inconvenient   spot   this   hair   dryer   works   fine .   it   has   several   settings   that   are   good   as   well .   the   only   problem   that   i   see   with   the   hairdryer   is   that   the   switches   are   located   on   the   handle   and   as   your   hand   wraps   around   to   hold   the   dryer ,   you   inadvertently   shut   it   off .   it   s   annoying   but   i   feel   as   though   it   s   just   something   i   will   get   used   to   in   time .   everything   else   about   it   is   so   far ,   so   good .
best   blowdryer   i   ve   purchased   well   worth   the   investment !   i   ve   owned   various   blowdryers   through   the   years ,   but   this   one   is   my   favorite   by   far .   it   s   relatively   lightweight   though   i   wouldn   t   say   it   s   featherweight ,   but   it   is   quite   a   bit   lighter   than   most   dryers   on   the   market   ,   dries   hair   faster   than   any   other   dryer   i   ve   used ,   and   generally   creates   smoother ,   shinier   results .   i   love   that   you   can   pop   off   the   back   and   replace   clean   the   little   air   filter ,   since   most   of   my   dryers   in   the   past   lost   power   over   time   because   the   filter   got   clogged   with   dust   and   i   couldn   t   clean   it .   after   my   most   recent   cut   my   stylist   gave   me   a   blowout   with   this   dryer ,   so   i   knew   it   was   reliable .   the   way   i   see   it ,   i   wear   my   hair   every   day   and   it   surrounds   my   face ,   so   it   s   worth   investing   in   a   tool   that   will   give   me   consistently   great   results   that   improve   my   appearance .   i   highly   recommend   this   dryer !   and   by   the   way ,   i   purchased   it   from   someone   on   amazon   who   was   selling   a   new   one   for   about   a   hundred   dollars .   it   was   a   great   value   and   i   ve   had   no   problems   with   it !
this   dryer   has   an   ionic   on   off   switch .   this   dryer   works   like   it   should .   the   dryer   has   an   ionic   on   off   switch ,   which   was   the   only   reason   we   bought   it .
i   love   this   blowdryer ! ! !   this   blow   dryer   did   everything   they   said   it   would   do .   my   hair   looks   like   i   stepped   out   of   the   salon   with   that   salon   finish   everyday !   it   is   shiny   like   they   said   it   would   be   and   it   is   not   damaging   to   my   hair   at   all .   this   is   a   great   blow   dryer   for   someone   to   use   in   their   home   once   or   twice   a   day   but   i   would   not   recommend   this   blowdryer   for   salon   use   because   it   does   start   to   feel   a   little   heavy   after   a   few   minutes   so   i   couldent   see   a   stylist   holding   this   dryer   for   8   hrs   a   day   which   is   unfortunate   cause   it   is   a   great   dryer ! !
does   not   retract   i   dislike   the   hair   dryer   and   i   was   overcharged   for   it   38.50   by   hairproducts . com .   icky .   the   reason   i   dislike   it   is   simple   a   retractable   cord   should   retract .   it   simply   doesn   t   retract .   i   hang   it   on   my   wall   and   everyone   sees   the   ugly   cord   dangling .
ear   splitting   hot   air   this   hair   dryer   is   extremely   loud   and   uncomfortable   to   use .   it   also   makes   you   sit   with   your   face   away   from   the   body   of   the   dryer ,   so   it   s   impossible   to   work   or   write   while   using   it .   it   would   have   been   nice   to   know   this   in   advance .   all   in   all   it   s   terrible
soft   bonnet   hair   dryer   the   attachment   to   the   hair   bonnet   does   not   hold   well .   other   than   that ,   i   m   happy   with   the   purchase .
try   something   else   it   worked   ok   in   the   first   5   uses   and   the   it   just   fell   apart   till   it   died .   when   working   heat   in   the   bonnet   was   not   equally   distributed .
great   dryer   this   dryer   is   quiet   effective ,   especially   for   the   price .   i   m   very   happy   with   it !
sadbuyer   buyer   beware ! ! !   this   hair   dryer   has   four   settings   off ,   low   no   heat   ,   scorch   and   torch ,   a   most   disappointing   purchase   from   hot   tools .   there   is   a   positive ,   the   bonnet   is   much   better   than   one   from   a   prior   hot   tools   purchase .   hoping   for   a   short   life   span   for   this   hair   dryer ,   so   that   i   can   buy   another   brand .
great   blow   dryer ! !   i   love   this   blow   dryer ... it   gets   my   hair   dried   fast   and   has   different   temperature   settings   and   even   a   cool   blast   button .   for   those   going   natural   this   is   a   great   choice ! !
wall   mounted   hair   dryer   i   have   had   three   of   these   hair   dryers ,   and   they   last   me   about   two   years .   i   like   the   convenience   of   having   them   on   my   bathroom   wall .
great   little   dryer   not   much   to   say   here   ...   this   is   a   small   hair   dryer   perfect   for   travel   i   wanted   it   to   keep   in   our   rv .   i   have   a   lot   of   hair   and   it   s   completely   dry   in   4   minutes   with   this   little   guy .   very   happy   with   the   purchase .
the   best   hair   dryer   i   ve   ever   owned   this   is   the   best   hair   dryer .   i   usually   go   for   cheap   or   easy   to   travel   with   hair   dryers ,   but   decided   to   try   a   fair   priced   ionic   hair   dryer   to   protect   my   hair .   i   m   so   glad   i   did ! !   this   dryer   dries   my   long   hair   in   about   5   7   minutes   and   leaves   it   straight   and   smooth .   i   hardly   have   to   use   my   flat   irons   which   saves   my   hair   even   more   from   heat   damage .   i   am   very   satisfied   with   this   purchase .   sometimes   the   smallest   things   make   the   biggest   difference !
excelllent   dryer   light   weight ,   effective   hairdryer .   like   the   folding   handle   for   travel   and   storage   purposes .   retractable   cord   nice   feature .   wish   it   had   a   cool   setting   or   cold   shot   button .   overall ,   great   dryer   at   a   terrific   price !
red   hot !   i   researched   many   sites   and   brands   before   i   purchased   this   hair   dryer .   i   must   admit   i   was   initially   attracted   to   the   red   color   but   then   was   impressed   with   the   other   attributes .   my   hair   is   relatively   short   and   fine .   i   need   a   dryer   to   help   give   my   hair   body   and   this   one   does   it   very   well .   i   like   the   attatchment   that   can   be   used   as   a   comb   since   it   can   be   used   with   one   hand   i   recently   had   elbow   surgery   so   this   enables   me   to   dry   my   hair   with   one   hand .   it   is   heavy   enough   to   feel   substantial   but   light   enough   that   i   am   comfortable   using   it   in   my   non   dominant   hand .
just   what   i   wanted   this   little   hair   dryer   was   just   what   i   was   looking   for !   it   is   small   and   light   weight ,   just   right   for   me .   i   also   wanted   a   dryer   that   was   low   amperage   as   my   old   one   kept   blowing   the   circuit !   all   in   all   a   great   price ,   too .
perfect !   i   am   a   flight   attendant   and   this   travel   dryer   is   powerful !   better   than   any   hotel   hair   dryer .   i   love   it   and   it   s   cheap .
the   quality   is   awesome   i   like   it   so   much .   even   the   button   is   kind   of   easy   to   accidently   push ,   but   i   don   t   think   it   s   a   big   deal .
the   best   dryer   ever !   i   recommend   this   dryer   100   .   really   a   good   product .   i   dried   my   hair   in   only   20   minutes   and   the   appearance   was   shinny   and   straight .
happy !   this   hair   dryer   is   the   best   i   have   ever   owned .   i   do   not   think   that   it   is   too   heavy ,   or   has   a   short   cord ,   or   too   loud .   it   all   worked   out   for   me .   the   heat   is   not   as   hot   as   plastic   dryers ,   and   i   did   not   have   frizz .   it   held   my   style   in   place .   i   gave   it   5   stars   because   i   am   am   very   pleased   with   this   purchase .
comment   from   a   professional   hair   styler   i   am   very   happy   with   this   hair   dryer .   its   light   weight .   poweful ,   but   doesn   t   burn   the   hair .   a   great   buy   for   any   professional .
wall   mount   hair   dryer   great   product .   does   exactly   what   i   wanted   it   to   do   and   easy   to   mount   on   the   wall .   perfect   for   guest   bathroom .
simple ,   solid ,   excellent   hair   dryer   i   bought   my   old   conair   a   very   similar   style   in   the   late   70s   and   used   it   for   nearly   30   years .   astonishing .   i   replaced   the   cord ,   which   had   a   crack   near   the   plug ,   in   the   early   90s .   thought   about   doing   it   again   when   the   new   20   year   old   cord   cracked ,   but   in   our   throw   away   culture ,   it   s   now   much   more   expensive   to   fix .   i   like   this   new   one   very   much ,   mainly   because   it   s   very   much   like   my   old   one ,   though   this   has   a   sturdier   safer   plug   with   a   fuse   reset   button ,   a   great   idea .   frankly ,   the   cold   air   setting   doesn   t   blow   quite   as   hard   as   my   old   one ,   but   the   feature   is   hard   to   find ,   and   this   one   still   gets   the   job   done .   overall ,   i   m   very   pleased   and   i   d   recommend   this   highly .
great   small   dryer   this   is   a   great   little   dryer .   i   have   fine   hair   and   it   s   nice   that   on   low   it   has   a   nice   gentle   blow   speed   and   temperature .
overall   good   product   pros   good   quality ,   comfortable   to   hold   in   hand .   cons   the   plug   is   bulky   seems   to   be   true   for   all   hair   dryers   though   and   the   switch   is   a   little   difficult   to   operate .
great   size ,   but   only   the   high   speed   works   on   the   250   setting   bought   this   hair   dryer   for   our   trip   to   italy .   perfect   traveling   size ,   but   when   using   the   250   voltage   setting   only   the   high   speed   worked .   it   got   way   too   hot   on   that   setting   to   use   comfortably .   i   ended   up   not   being   able   to   use   it   because   it   burned   my   skin   and   blew   my   hair   too   hard   to   style   it .   i   started   washing   my   hair   at   night   and   letting   it   air   dry .   the   low   and   high   settings   work   fine   in   the   states   on   the   other   voltage ,   but   it   was   a   waste   to   buy   it   specifically   for   the   dual   voltage   piece   and   then   not   be   able   to   use   it   anyway .
small ,   compact   and   powerful !   bought   this   together   with   the   other   andis   tourmaline   model .   this   one   is   for   my   daughter .   the   hairdryer   is   powerful   yet   light   and   we   love   the   retractable   cord !   it   stores   away   neatly   in   the   bathroom   cabinet .   we   have   been   using   these   andis   hairdryers   daily   for   2   years   now   and   both   are   still   going   strong .   i   have   never   heard   of   this   brand   until   i   used   this   in   a   luxury   hotel   i   was   so   impressed   with   the   performance   and   design   of   the   item   that   i   searched   for   it   online   when   we   got   home .   for   the   price ,   design   and   performance ,   this   is   a   great   buy !
solid   and   well   made   bought   this   on   amazon   2   years   ago   and   it   is   still   going   strong !   i   never   heard   of   this   brand   before   i   saw   it   in   a   luxury   hotel .   i   was   so   impressed   with   the   power   and   design   of   the   hair   dryer   that   when   my   conair   died ,   i   searched   for   andis   online   and   found   it   here .   the   overall   item   is   well   made   and   solid .   the   gorgeous   deep   red   color   is   very   rich   and   boy   is   it   powerful !   i   use   it   to   dry   my   hair   daily   and   it   has   held   up   well .   there   is   a   heft   to   the   item   and   does   not   feel   cheap   or   plastic   ky   like   my   old   conair .   the   andis   also   comes   with   a   nice   long   cord   but   i   did   wish   it   retracts   to   make   storage   neater .   i   am   giving   this   a   4   star   because   of   that .
great   dryer   very   cool   and   sleak   design   that   i   expect   from   bed   head .   my   hair   drys   quick   and   the   ions   leave   it   smooth ,   shiny ,   and   less   fried   awesome   dryer ! ! !
t3   micro   featherweight   luxe   hair   dryer   2.9   pound   i   was   so   lucky   to   find   this   wonderful   dryer   with   diffuser ,   you   see   i   had   one   for   20   years ,   and   it   finally   blew   up ,   i   had   loved   it   so   much   i   had   to   find   another   one ,   i   was   so   happy   with   my   purchase .   i   use   it   about   10   to   15   times   a   day ,   i   am   a   professional   hairdresser   and   have   to   have   good   equipment .   thank   you   for   my   dryer .
great   product   bonnet   size   is   perfect .   20   minutes   is   enough   to   get   my   hair   dry .   it   s   not   noisy .   it   work   very   well   and   never   turn   off .   bought   it   was   a   good   decision .   i   use   it   while   i   watch   tv   or   read .
hair   dryer   love   it .   keeps   counter   space   clean ,   but   yet   the   dryer   is   handy   to   use .
good   buy   i   like   the   three   temp .   and   three   levels   of   air   pressure .   it   makes   a   big   difference   i   can   use   it   for   myself   and   for   my   daughter   who   does   not   like   heat .
disappointed   i   paid   an   extra   twenty   five   dollars   to   have   the   hair   dryer   shipped   a . s . a . p .   as   i   needed   it   right   away .   it   arrive   wrapped   in   a   priority   envelope   in   the   thin   box   that   the   hair   dryer   came   in .   i   don   t   know   if   it   was   damaged   in   shipping   from   poor   packaging   or   if   it   was   damaged   before ,   but   it   makes   an   elecricl   element   noise   each   time   it   is   turned   on   and   off .   it   also   gets   too   hot ,   so   i   suspect   it   might   have   had   the   thermostat   damaged .   the   t3   featherweight   luxe   hair   dryer   is   awesome   and   makes   your   hair   feel   much   healthier .   i   am   disappointed   in   this   particular   one   and   the   way   that   it   was   shipped .
not   so   new   i   like   the   hairdryer ,   but   am   disappointed   in   the   purchase .   it   was   labeled   as   new ,   but   when   i   got   it   i   noticed   that   the   filter   already   had   quite   a   bit   of   lint   buildup   and   there   were   little ,   cut   hairs   stuck   to   the   velcro   cord   wrap .   i   got   the   feeling   that   maybe   this   item   had   been   used   in   a   salon .   it   looked   pretty   new ,   so   perhaps   it   was   used   as   a   demo .   the   new   description   was   therefore   misleading .
blow   and   go   still   can   t   get   a   handle   on   this   product ............ can   t   seem   to   get   it   to   hold   standing   position   on   a   counter   top ............... holds   great   on   a   mirror .
possible   fire !   i   got   this   blow   dryer   and   returned   it   within   a   week .   it   s   a   cute   dryer ,   but   when   i   turned   it   on   high   and   shut   it   off   it   would   smoke .   it   wouldn   t   do   it   on   low ,   but   i   still   felt   it   was   unsafe .   it   could   have   just   been   the   dryer   that   i   got ,   just   be   aware   if   you   purchase   one .
excellent   hairdryer   no   bells   and   whistles   on   this   hairdryer   just   an   excellent   product .   very   powerful   and   light   to   hold .   it   arrived   very   promptly   and   i   recommend   it .
not   good   for   fine   hair   having   baby   fine   hair   and   not   a   lot   of   it ,   i   find   my   hair   feels   more   dry   and   brittle   after   using   this   dryer   for   the   last   month .   there   are   3   speeds   and   3   heat   settings ,   the   1st   heat   setting   being   cool .   the   1st   speed   setting   is   too   low   even   for   my   hair .   the   highest   speed   and   heat   settings   are   way   to   strong   and   burning   hot   for   my   head .   the   switch   placement   is   a   pain   as   you   have   to   be   careful   not   to   accidently   hit   them   when   holding   the   handle .   i   don   t   think   this   dryer   is   worth   its   higher   price .
overall   impressed   i   was   skeptical   about   buying   such   an   expensive   hair   dryer .   however ,   my   best   friend   had   one   and   i   tried   it   on   a   trip .   i   thought   i   liked   it   but   still   wasn   t   sure   about   spending   the   money .   my   stylist   let   one   of   the   other   girls   dry   my   hair   one   day .   she   used   one   when   drying   my   hair .   i   commented   on   how   soft   and   smooth   my   hair   was .   i   usually   get   my   hair   flat   ironed   to   get   the   same   effect .   she   didn   t   have   to .   i   called   my   girlfriend   to   see   if   her   hair   dryer   was   the   same   brand   and   it   was .   so   i   bought   one .   i   love   it   and   haven   t   flat   ironed   my   hair   yet !   the   only   thing   i   was   dissapointed   in   was   that   the   warranty   doesn   t   apply   to   the   purchases   from   amzon .   i   just   hope   it   lasts   for   a   long   time   so   i   don   t   feel   cheated .   overall   i   am   very   impressed .   i   didn   t   realize   that   a   hair   dryer   can   make   such   a   difference   in   your   hair .   i   say   go   for   it !
it   s   a   great   hair   dryer   i   love   it ,   it   gets   the   job   done .   it   was   inexpensive   and   jsut   as   powerful   as   my   other   hair   dryers .   i   recommend   it   for   anyone .
no   good   asin   b000rzll38   oster   professional   76932   710   wall   mount   hair   dryer   owned   this   unit   for   less   than   three   months   and   it   quit .   i   certainly   would   not   buy   this   brand   ever   !
nothing   special ..   i   bought   this   dryer   expected   outstanding   results .   it   performs   no   better   than   any   hairdryer   i   have   had ..   matter   of   fact ,   maybe   not   as   good ... it   does   not   have   the   blowing   power   that   my   revlon   has ,   and   is   not   any   lighter .   i   don   t   know   what   all   the   hype   is   about   this   one ... save   your   money   and   get   a   30   one .. i   found   out   they   are   just   as   good .
not   a   reliable   choice   we   have   owned   three   of   these   and   none   have   been   reliable .   the   first   arrived   with   a   cord   that   would   not   retract .   amazon   replaced   it   and   that   one   lasted   one   year   before   it   failed .   it   sounded   like   broken   bits   of   plastic   were   inside   the   fan   so   we   stopped   using   it .   we   ordered   another   and   it   failed   after   6   weeks .   the   fan   speed   on   high   is   about   what   you   would   get   on   low .   there   seems   to   be   a   quality   issue   here   that   i   advise   you   to   stay   away   from .
this   dryer   blows   poorly   after   much   urging   from   my   wife ,   she   bit   the   bullet   and   spent   the   extra   money   on   this   dryer .   when   it   was   working   little   less   than   a   year   ,   she   was   happy .   when   it   stopped   working ,   well ,   not   so   much .   and   it   s   not   as   though   you   can   repair   these   things .   they   have   no   user   serviceable   parts ,   outside   of   the   little   grill   that   your   wife   s   hair   accumulates   in .   don   t   buy   the   hype ,   and   don   t   buy   this   dryer .   you   can   buy   8   or   9   hair   dryers   that   will   work   just   as   well   and   cost   less   combined ,   and   die   off   just   as   quickly ,   or   maybe   even   not   as   quickly   if   you   re   lucky .   why   spend   the   extra   money   on   something   that   doesn   t   offer   anything   extra  
its   compact ! ! !   great   compact   design .   i   love   the   cord   hanger .   the   light   is   pretty   bright ,   but   exactly   as   advertised .   it   does   take   longer   to   dry   my   hair   but   it   is   doing   less   damage ....
doesn   t   get   hot   enough   doesn   t   get   hot   enough   to   style   my   hair .   it   dries   it ,   and   leaves   it   frizz   free ,   but   it   just   doesn   t   get   hot   enough   to   shorten   my   drying   time   or   omit   the   need   for   straightening   iron .   it   is   nicely   designed   and   really   light   weight ,   but   it   just   didn   t   do   the   job .   i   m   returning   mine .
vendor   is   odd   cheaper   elsewhere   i   ordered   this   item   as   a   birthday   gift   for   my   wife   3   weeks   in   advance .   i   never   received   the   product ,   but   did   get   a   email   with   a   gift   certificate   for   0.00 .   i   spoke   with   the   vendor   twice ,   once   on   the   phone   and   once   via   chat .   both   times   the   conversations   were   hard   to   understand   and   confusing .   br   br   stay   away   from   this   vendor .   you   can   get   this   item   at   kmart   for   14.99   but   shipping   was   6.95 ... pick   up   at   store   is   0   .
a   great ,   basic   little   hair   dryer   from   a   trusted   name   brand   don   t   let   its   small   size   fool   you .   this   blow   dryer   is   one   of   the   best   available   at   major   retailers   today .   when   i   went   shopping   for   a   new   blow   dryer ,   this   one   actually   looked   sturdier   than   its   bulkier ,   more   expensive   conair   cousins ,   with   their   breakable   diffusers   and   fragile   looking   reset   buttons .   the   d5000   s   compact   size   makes   it   easy   to   hold ,   and   it   won   t   take   up   much   space   on   on   your   bathroom   counter   when   you   re   done   with   it .   although   it   s   touted   as   a   travel   dryer ,   i   find   that   it   makes   a   great   daily   styling   tool ,   drying   my   damp   hair   in   just   a   few   minutes   caveat   i   have   fine ,   medium   length   hair ,   so   someone   with   longer   or   thicker   hair   might   need   something   more   heavy   duty   .   br   br   my   only   complaint   about   this   dryer   is   that   it   s   kind   of   loud .   granted ,   it   is   still   an   improvement   over   my   old   sunbeam   blow   dryer ,   which   sounded   like   demons   being   released   from   the   bowels   of   hell   when   i   turned   it   on .   with   the   remington ,   i   find   that   wearing   earplugs   reduces   the   noise   to   an   acceptable   level .   with   that   said ,   i   do   have   sensitive   hearing ,   so   a   normal   person   may   not   have   a   problem   with   the   noise .   br   br   if   this   hair   dryer   lasts   as   long   as   my   last   one ,   which   i   owned   for   about   five   years ,   then   i   will   be   satisfied .
great   dryer !   i   ve   had   this   dryer   for   five   years   and   have   used   it   everyday !   it   s   still   working   like   new !   br   it   retracts   nicely   and   fits   great   into   my   bathroom   drawer .
ok   this   hairdryer   is   ok .   i   like   some   aspects   of   it   such   as   being   able   to   adjust   the   heat   and   air   level ,   but   i   don   t   think   that   this   dries   my   hair   any   faster   than   the   other   cheaper   hair   dryer   that   i   have .   i   also   feel   the   weight   on   my   arms   that   other   reviewers   were   discussing .   i   am   not   sure   that   it   has   had   any   effect   on   the   level   of   shine   or   frizz   in   my   hair   although   being   able   to   adjust   the   level   of   heat   and   air   has   probably   helped   in   terms   of   being   able   to   prevent   heat   damage .   i   think   it   is   an   ok   hair   dryer   but   i   would   not   buy   it   again .   i   did   not   return   it   mostly   because   of   the   hassle   of   repackaging   and   sending   it   back .
loud   but   dries   fast   bought   this   dual   voltage   drier   for   my   trip   to   europe .   dried   my   hair   quickly ,   was   compact   for   travel ,   used   low   setting   only   based   on   prior   reviews .   great   dryer   but   loud !
not   pleased   we   have   had   this   hairdryer   slightly   over   a   month   and   now   it   only   works   at   low   speed .   when   it   worked ,   it   worked   great .   but   just   a   month   before   a   problem   unacceptable   at   any   price .
waste   of   money .   it   s   too   loud ,   so   i   didn   t   used   it   a   lot ,   like   aroud   seven   times   the   last   time   i   used   it ,   it   stop   working   suddenly   and   it   smells   like   something   just   burned ,   already   is   in   the   dumpster .
excelent   service   i   place   my   order   on   wednesday   september   1st   and   i   was   shocked   that   i   already   got   it   today   september   4th   i   am   very   pleased   with   them   because   i   need   it   the   item   right   away   and   i   got   it   without   paying   extra   money   for   rush   delivery .   i   won   t   think   twice   to   buy   again   from   them   and   i   would   definately   recomend   them   to   everybody .   excellent   packing   and   professionally   well   done .   two   thumbs   up   and   five   stars .
hair   dryer   this   is   the   best   hair   dryer   i   have   ever   owned ! !   it   cuts   drying   time   to   my   longish   highlighted   blonde   hair   way   down   and   makes   my   hair   smooth ,   shiny   and   frizz   free .   my   hair   looks   like   i   just   left   the   salon   everyday !
if   you   re   looking   for   a   quiet   dryer ,   this   is   not   it !   i   ve   had   this   dryer   since   july   and   use   it   daily .   it   s   no   better   or   worse   than   any   other   dryer   i   ve   used   in   its   price   range .   previously   bought   one   for   89   chi   because   it   was   quiet   it   quit   working   after   13   months   1   month   past   the   warranty   period .   keep   in   mind   this   dryer   is   not   quiet .
cheap   cord ,   broke   in   5   months ,   fire   hazard   the   hair   dryer   design   itself   is   good ,   but   the   material   the   cord   is   made   out   of   is   cheap .   after   5   months   of   daily   use ,   it   lost   its   connection   within   the   wiring ,   near   the   end   of   the   plug .   since   it   s   more   than   60   days ,   i   can   t   return   it   to   the   store .   and   since   it   costs   me   money   to   ship   it   back   to   conair ,   and   i   have   to   include   another   5.00   for   their   shipping   an   new   on   back   to   me ,   i   think   i   ll   just   toss   it   in   the   trash .   i   will   not   waste   my   time   or   more   money   on   conair .
great   dryer   this   is   my   second   purchase   of   this   dryer   the   first   one   lasted   for   about   10   years .   the   newer   model   is   great   i   would   highly   recommend   it   as   i   have   to   many   friends .
meh .   not   that   great   and   only   lasted   two   years ...   hi   gang ,   i   just   threw   this   hair   dryer   away   after   having   it   for   about   two   years .   it   has   begun   to   smoke   and   smell   horrible .   i   did   some   research   and   found   out   that   bespoke   will   do   anything   to   get   out   of   a   warranty   for   this   thing .   if   you   bought   it   here   at   amazon   they   won   t   touch   it .   hence   the   circular   file ...   when   it   did   work ,   it   worked   just   okay .   i   didn   t   like   the   speeds   on   the   fan   or   the   heat   settings .   high   is   too   high ,   low   is   too   low ,   none   of   them   felt   quite   right .   save   yourself   some   money   and   buy   the   remington   d2012   that   they   sell   here   at   amazon .   our   new   one   just   arrived .   it   s   got   a   quieter   motor ,   absolute   perfect   fan   speeds   and   heat   settings ,   and   a   true   4   year   warranty .   best   part   you   can   buy   almost   three   of   them   for   the   price   i   paid   for   the   bespoke .   if   you   are   looking   for   a   top   of   the   line   hair   dryer   then   keep   looking .   the   bespoke   has   no   warranty   here   and   the   product   really   isn   t   that   well   thought   out   in   the   first   place .   look   at   one   of   the   other   offerings   and   make   sure   you   get   a   true   warranty .
great   hair   dryer   used   this   hair   dryer   at   a   hotel   and   loved   it   had   to   order   great   price   great   travel   hair   dryer   folds   nice .
bristles   on   brush   defective   after   only   using   it   once   i   noticed   the   bristles   on   the   brush   attachment   have   already   started   to   flatten .   i   am   returning   it   because   i   can   only   imagine   what   it   s   going   to   look   like   after   daily   use   for   only   a   month .   i   noticed   another   reviewer   wrote   s   he   is   looking   for   replacement   attachments .   i   d   rather   just   buy   a   better   quality   product   to   start   with .   also ,   the   power   of   this   hairdryer   doesn   t   even   match   my   cheaper   conair   dryer   that   i   bought   at   the   drugstore   and   was   hoping   to   replace   with   this   more   expensive   and   supposedly   better   quality   hairdryer .
user   this   model   replaces   an   earlier   one   that   put   out   a   lot   of   heat ,   but   the   replacement   one ,   while   seemingly   appearing   to   have   been   upgraded ,   does   not   put   out   the   level   of   heat   as   the   one   i   replaced   after   several   years   of   use .   that   one   died .   also ,   the   digital   clock   is   not   included   in   the   replacement   model .   that   was   a   feature   much   appreciated   so   without   it   i   feel   a   bit   more   of   disapointment .   however ,   the   replacement   model   does   look   smart   mounted   on   the   bathroom   wall .
andis   hair   dryer   this   is   a   great   hair   dryer .   unlike   most   non   commercial   hair   dryers ,   it   gets   hot   enough   to   quickly   dry   my   hair .   it   s   weight   is   typical   for   dryers   this   size .   the   buttons   on   the   handle   are   easily   avoided   once   you   use   the   dryer   a   couple   of   times .   i   also   like   the   color .   i   would   buy   this   brand   again .
wonderful   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   at   the   bx   once   i   graduated   basic   training .   i   love   it !   i   have   really   thick   hair   and   i   ve   notice   that   my   drying   time   is   cut   by   half ,   and   its   pink !
love   my   hairdryer   i   purchased   the   conair   wallmount   dryer   because   we   absolutely   wore   out   our   last   one   and   we   loved   that   one   so   much   that   we   bought   another .   i   have   these   hairdryers   in   both   of   our   bathrooms   and   they   are   so   handy   because   they   are   right   there .   just   pick   it   up   and   turn   it   on   and   you   are   ready   to   go .   great   product .
adequate   dryer ,   but   think   twice   if   you   want   to   use   the   attachments .   i   purchased   this   hair   dryer   to   replace   my   super   solano   that   died   after   more   than   a   decade .   i   loved   the   solano ,   but   i   wanted   to   see   if   a   significantly   less   expensive   dryer   would   work   as   well .   the   good   news   is ,   it   dries   just   fine .   the   bad   news   is   that   the   concentrator   attachment   there   are   three   attachments   i   use   the   narrow   concentrator   every   day   for   straightening   is   unnecessarily   difficult   to   attach .   for   the   first   couple   of   months ,   it   took   a   great   deal   of   effort   and   force   to   get   the   concentrator   nozzle   attached .   i   had   to   twist   and   turn   and   manuever   it   every   which   way .   even   when   i   managed   to   get   it   on ,   it   was   easy   to   knock   it   off   during   the   course   of   drying   my   hair .   i   had   to   wait   a   minute   or   two   to   reattach   it   because   the   nozzle   was   too   hot   to   handle .   when   it   cooled   down   sufficiently ,   the   twisting   and   turning   began   anew .   when   this   happened   numerous   times   during   one   attempt   to   dry   my   hair ,   it   got   pretty   frustrating .   br   as   others   have   noted ,   the   thin   chrome   finish   of   the   dryer   chips   off   very   easily ,   particularly   when   using   the   attachments .   after   having   owned   this   for   about   two   months ,   the   chrome   is   completely   chipped   off   the   dryer   has   a   matte   black   finish   underneath   the   chrome   where   the   concentrator   attaches .   it   doesn   t   look   great ,   but   i   don   t   have   to   worry   anymore   about   brushing   chrome   flakes   off   my   clothes   every   morning .   br   over   the   past   week ,   it   s   gotten   much   easier   to   get   the   concentrator   attached ,   and   it   s   less   prone   to   fall   off .   i   assume   it   just   took   a   couple   of   months   to   stretch .   br   br   update   11   9   10   the   attachment   no   longer   will   stay   on   the   dryer .   i   m   reducing   the   rating   to   two   stars ,   because   without   the   attachment ,   this   dryer   is   worthless   to   me .
crooks !   i   purchased   one   to   try .   then   two   more ,   the   first   on   failed   at   at   arrival   and   since   i   call   32   days   after   i   ordered ,   not   received .   it   has   been   used   twice !   they   declined   to   honor   this   purchase   i   have   called   five   times   to   only   be   told   there   is   no   supervisor   to   make   a   decision   them   they   tell   me   they   declined   it .   but   will   never   call   or   email   back !   the   product   is   defective .   the   handle   is   burning   up   and   burnt   my   daughter   s   hand !   dissipointed ! ! !
excellent   product .   this   hair   dryer   is   wonderful .   drys   my   hair   much   more   quickly   than   the   conair   dryer   i   purchased   at   target .   very   sturdy .   would   recommend   it   as   a   great   investment   in   hair   care .
mom2jonah   i   like   this   hair   dryer   a   lot .   it   does   dry   my   hair   faster   and   it   is   quieter   compared   to   my   old   30   dollar   dryer .   the   only   con   is   that   it   is   heavier   than   my   old   dryer .   i   m   a   little   concerned   about   how   it   was   packaged .   it   looks   like   the   item   was   opened   and   then   repackaged .   each   piece   inside   the   box   was   repackaged   and   closed   with   twisty   ties .   hopefully   i   won   t   have   any   problems   with   it   and   it   will   last .   i   would   recommend   this   dryer   to   anyone   who   has   thick   hair   and   a   lot   of   it !
amazing   difference   i   asked   my   hairdresser   if   dryers   made   a   difference   and   she   went   on   and   on   about   the   one   she   used   which   is   this   one .   she   said   she   even   takes   it   home   evenings   and   weekends   to   use   on   her   own   hair .   bad   news   it   cost   about   350 !   i   wrote   down   the   model   and   thought   i   would   just   see   what   i   could   find .   i   couldn   t   believe   it   when   i   found   it   on   here   for   under   100 !   i   got   it   within   three   days   of   placing   my   order   and   tried   it   right   away .   it   was   truly   amazing   the   difference   it   made   with   my   hair .   i   have   thinner   hair   with   a   natural   wave   so   when   it   dries   it   dries   more   curly   and   frizzy   so   i   usually   use   a   round   brush   with   a   dryer   to   straighten   and   smooth   it .   with   this   dryer ,   it   was   shinier   and   smoother   in   half   the   time .   i   have   been   able   to   come   close   to   how   it   looks   when   it   is   professionally   blown   out .   for   all   those   who   don   t   think   a   dryer   makes   a   difference   i   m   telling   you   this   one   did   for   me .   couldn   t   be   happier   with   the   purchase .
great   this   blow   dryer   was   in   a   hotel   room   i   was   staying   at .   i   fell   in   love   with   it   it   dried   my   hair   so   fast   it   is   very   powerful   i   love   it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
great   dryer   i   bought   this   for   my   daughters   to   use   in   their   bathroom .   it   is   out   of   the   way   and   no   cords   on   the   counter .   the   green   night   light   is   bright ,   but   the   girls   like   it   since   it   brightens   the   bathroom   up   at   night !   they   can   remove   replace   the   dryer   by   themselves   they   are   5   and   10   years   old   .   they   don   t   have   to   squeeze   anything   to   remove   it .   just   gently   pull .   it   is   quiet   with   high   low   speeds .   i   did   not   use   the   anchors   screws   that   came   with   the   kit .   since   i   had   young   girls   who   would   be   pulling   the   dryer   off   of   the   wall   and   may   not   be   so   gentle ,   i   replaced   those   with   drywall   toggle   bolts .   it   is   nice   that   the   gfi   is   built   into   the   unit   and   not   on   the   plug   so   that   the   plug   does   not   block   an   outlet   or   have   to   plug   into   the   bottom   outlet   only .   i   recommend   this   product .   only   reason   for   4   stars   is   because   of   the   hardware   they   sent   with   it .   there   is   no   way   i   can   see   those   screws   and   anchors   staying   in   the   wall   with   people   pulling   on   the   dryer   to   remove   it !
conair   pro   puts   out   the   air !   this   conair   pro   is   one   of   the   few   hair   dryers   that   still   uses   a   squirrel   cage   blower   fan .   this   type   of   fan   puts   out   a   lot   more   air   than   the   prop   style   for   the   same   noise   level .   this   is   a   pro   quality   dryer   with   a   heavy   duty   motor   so   it   weighs   a   little   more   than   a   regular   unit .   it   does   the   job   fast .
andis   rc   2   ionic   hair   dryer   i   used   this   hair   dryer   while   on   vacation   and   loved   it .   i   like   everything   about   it   except ,   i   d   like   a   longer   cord .   i   especially   like   the   way   the   cord   retracts   so   you   don   t   have   it   lying   around   on   the   counter .   i   would   definitely   recommend   it .
too   slow   this   product   was   recommended   to   me   by   a   friend   who   always   has   good   hair .   i   bought   it   and   i   am   dissappointed   with   as   its   so   slow .   i   thought   since   i   was   paying   so   much   it   would   be   quicker   better .   i   don   t   personally   like   it   that   much .   you   need   to   have   a   lot   of   time   and   patience   and   for   that   you   can   probably   get   good   hair   with   any   priced   dryer .
purchased   3   of   them   i   first   purchased   the   wall   mount   hair   dryer   for   our   5th   wheel ,   and   since   i   have   installed   them   in   two   bathrooms   in   our   home ,   the   wife   loves   them !
very   happy   customer   i   have   owned   this   dryer   for   about   6   months ,   and   it   is   the   best   one   i   ve   ever   had .   it   makes   my   hair   so   soft ,   silky ,   and   bouncy   just   like   when   i   get   my   hair   done   at   the   dominican   salons   with   a   blow   out .   i   have   very   thick ,   course ,   afro   american   hair ,   and   i   ve   always   hated   blow   drying   my   hair .   it   always   turned   out   very   dry   and   brittle   until   i   used   this   dryer   or   went   to   the   salon   .   i   found   it   at   target   for   under   25 ,   and   it   s   definitely   one   of   the   best   hair   products   i   ve   ever   used .   i   have   even   tried   a   few   other   ionic   tourmaline   ceramic   dryers ,   but   this   one   did   my   hair   so   much   nicer .
the   best   hairdryer   ever !   for   the   last   couple   of   months   i   have   researched   and   read   reviews   of   every   hair   dryer   imaginable   on   every   website   imaginable   and   finally   settled   on   this   hair   dryer .   and   i   couldn   t   be   happier ! ! !   my   hair   is   1   .   straight   2   .   smooth   3   .   not   frizzy   4   .   shiny   5   .   volumous   6   .   looks   like   i   just   got   a   blow   out   at   a   salon   let   me   start   at   the   beginning .   my   hair   is   shoulder   length ,   somewhere   between   curly   and   wavy ,   tends   to   be   dry   and   frizzes   very   easily .   i   am   typically   a   slave   to   the   flat   iron ,   but   no   more .   here   is   what   i   did ,   step   by   step   to   achieve   my   best   hair   day   ever   that   i   have   done   myself   no   salon   styling   included   .   1   .   i   washed   and   conditioned   my   hair ,   as   usual   2   .   after   towel   drying   my   hair ,   i   used   a   wide   tooth   comb   to   smooth   it   out   and   put   a   dollop   of   leave   in   conditioner   on   the   ends .   i   then   let   my   hair   air   dry   for   about   10   minutes   while   i   putzed   around   the   house .   3   .   i   sectioned   my   hair   and   clipped   up   any   hair   i   was   not   blow   drying   at   the   time .   4   .   on   each   section   i   was   drying   i   put   a   tiny   dot   of   straightening   cream   and   worked   it   through   my   hair .   5   .   using   a   1.25   round   natural   bristle   brush ,   i   blew   each   section   dry   with   a   downward   motion   of   the   brush   and   dryer .   as   i   was   done   with   each   section ,   i   clipped   it   away   and   worked   with   one   section   at   a   time .   it   got   a   little   awkward   in   the   back ,   but   i   figured   i   would   touch   up   with   the   flat   iron   at   the   end .   6   .   there   was   no   need   for   touching   up !   my   hair   came   out   great .   i   used   a   dollop   of   shine   wax   when   i   was   done   drying   and   shaped   my   hair .   i   finished   with   a   spritz   of   hair   spray .   even   if   this   hair   dryer   broke   after   one   use ,   i   would   shell   out   the   cash   to   get   another   one .   it   is   that   worth   it .   i   did   not   have   any   problems   with   the   buttons   that   some   people   said   and   i   did   not   think   it   was   too   heavy   to   work   with   either .   what   can   i   say   i   love   this   hair   dryer   and   i   would   give   it   10   stars !
more   than   a   foot   balm   bought   this   item   for   my   husband   who   is   on   his   feet   24   7   and   has   difficult   toenails   and   a   sore   ankle .   applying   the   balm   to   his   ankle   definitely   seemed   to   improve   blood   circulation   as   the   pain   diminished   and   the   black   and   blue   appearance   also   normalized .   i   figured   i   would   try   it   on   my   extremely   dry   skin   even   on   my   face   after   a   day   working   in   the   backyard .   it   was   very   soothing   and   not   greasy   at   all .   dry ,   dead   skin   that   i   couldn   t   even   see   flaked   off   and   fine   lines   are   smoother .   i   will   definitely   recommend   this   easier   to   use   than   euciren   and   goes   a   long ,   long   way .
weavin   again   i   prefer   woven   floss ,   but   could   not   find   on   shelves   anywhere .   so   glad   to   be   weaving   again   instead   of   waxing .
it   really   works   i   have   been   using   this   product   for   a   few   months   now ,   and   it   honestly   does   work .   just   make   sure   you   get   the   pimple   asap .   i   always   get   some   pimples   during ,   ahem ,   that   time   of   the   month ,   and   it   really   is   annoying ,   because   i   normally   dont   get   any   at   all .   even   if   you   have   a   big   pimple ,   this   will   reduce   it .   it   gets   a   tiny   bit   painful   towards   the   end   when   its   really   hot ,   but   not   so   painful   that   i   have   to   remove   it .   it   does   leave   my   fair   skin   a   little   red ,   so   i   have   my   concealer   ready .   it   does   work , k   better   than   creams   and   such .
good   product ,   but   not   a   long   shelf   life   the   vacuum   works   nice   catches   the   cut   hair   and   it   is   easy   to   empty   the   collection   space .   cuts   hair   as   advertised ,   and   has   the   usual   snap   on   attachments .   lasted   a   year ,   then   quit   with   no   warning .   22   shipping .
safe   sunscreen   for   kids   in   stick   form ! !   i   ve   been   using   the   loving   naturals   sunscreen   lotion   for   my   15   month   old   and   decided   to   try   out   the   stick .   initial   reaction   love   it !   i   love   loving   naturals   products   because   they   are   made   of   safe   organic   ingredients   which   is   exactly   what   i   want   for   my   baby   s   sensitive   skin .   it   contains   almost   25   zinc   oxide   which   is   what   our   doctor   recommended   to   look   for   as   the   active   ingredient   as   this   is   the   best   protection   from   the   sun .   we   love   the   lotion ,   but   the   stick   is   great   for   keeping   in   your   purse   diaper   bag .   i   carry   it   with   me   everywhere   just   in   case   we   do   an   inpromptu   play   session   outside   and   i   love   that   it   s   a   stick   so   i   don   t   have   to   get   it   all   over   my   hands .
good ,   strong   wax   i   used   this   on   my   husband   s   back ,   and   while   yes ,   it   hurt   hello ,   you   re   pulling   the   hair   from   the   roots ,   of   course   it   hurts !   it   did   a   great   job   at   getting   all   of   the   hair .   it   didn   t   leave   much   of   anything   behind   and   i   never   had   to   redo   any   spots .   i   did   my   husband   s   entire   back   and   went   through   an   entire   thing   of   wax   although   we   had   tons   of   strips   leftover   ,   just   so   you   can   judge   how   much   you   might   need .   oh ,   and   it   smells   good ,   too !
all   three   shades   are   goof   proof .   all   three   shades   work   beautifully .   however   if   you   are   fairer   complected .   stick   with   bare   your   soul   and   look   on   the   bright   side .   this   one   is   a   bit   corally   with   a   ever   so   slight   shimmer .   its   all   sheer   and   will   work   but   would   just   look   better   on   asian   african   american   latin   skin   tones .   you   can   t   go   wrong   so   don   t   sweat   the   exact   shade .
good   i   have   been   using   this   for   a   year ,   love   it .   i   leave   the   1st   application   on   my   hair   for   40   min   to   cover   gray   completely .   this   will   make   your   hair   more   reddish   than   the   color   of   your   choice   so   be   careful .   i   use   color   black ,   so   the   finish   is   warm   brown   my   natural   hair   color   is   dark   brown   you   will   need   disposable   gloves   and   cap ,   and   some   plastic   sheet   to   cover   your   floor .
rain   thank   you   for   the   great   product ,   and   the   wonderful   samples   for   tanning .   i   now   know   where   to   go   to   purchase   products   such   as   this ...   nice   touch
great   product   this   mirror   is   awesome   for   plucking   stray   hairs   and   seeing   what   s   going   on   up   close   on   your   face .
works   good   this   is   the   next   best   thing   to   a   massaging   chair .   i   found   the   cushion   works   best   when   used   in   a   recliner .
not   as   advertised   the   filter   that   i   received   was   not   an   oem   filter   as   advertised .   it   fits   very   loose .
my   husband   loves   this   product   my   husband   loves   this   product ,   although   i   accidentally   way   overpaid   for   this   which   upsets   me ,   the   product   is   great   and   lasts   a   long   time .   he   has   used   it   many   times   before   and   it   smells   good ,   too !   next   time   just   get   it   directly   from   burts   bees   retailer   website   where   you   can   easily   get   it   for   cost !   you   don   t   have   to   get   it   from   amazon   s   private   dealers ,   which   can   way   overcharge   for   things .
disappointed   i   have   never   used   hair   spray   but   a   few   spritz   on   hair   after   i   roll   it .   i   use   hot   rollers   and   my   hair   is   thin   so   i   have   to   be   careful   with   products   left   on   hair   weighing   it   down .   even   with   the   regular   hair   spray   my   hair   would   look   like   helmot   head .. and   would   fall   before   i   even   went   outside .   outside ,   in   the   sun ,   would   cake .   anyway   i   read   that   the   sebastian   products   were   amazing .   so   with   high   hopes   i   purcahsed   the   re   shaper   with   the   mindset   you   could   finger   thorugh ,   etc .   i   even   went   as   far   as   spraying   each   section   before   i   hot   rolled   it   for   the   layered   in   hold .   then   spritzed   all   over   when   done .   today ,   after   i   did   this   i   had   amazing   curls ,   etc ..   didnt   even   leave   the   house   just   went   into   the   other   room   which   is   my   office .   it   is   air   conditioned   so   have   not   been   outside   yet .   the   door   bell   rang   less   than   20minutes   and   i   passed   by   the   mirror   and   the   hair   has   completely   fallen !   this   is   after   i   layered   every   curl   and   sprayed   entire   head   with   re   shaper   as   a   finisher .   what   a   disappointment .   my   hair   is   sticky   too .   im   not   sure   why   the   other   poster   said   it   stayed   great   even   after   finger   combing .   maybe   because   it   was   just   a   few   hairs   on   her   head   bangs   .   my   hair   has   fallen   and   left   with   the   feeling   of   hair   spray   on   my   hair .   so ,   not   sure   what   the   hype   was   all   about .   i   have   never   used   hair   spray   so   much   and   it   did   nothing .   lastly ,   my   fingers   did   snag   quite   considerably   when   i   tried   to   comb   my   hair   with   my   fingers   behind   my   ear .   since   the   curls   fell ,   i   tried   to   put   my   hair   behind   my   ears   so   it   wouldnt   be   in   my   face   and   my   fingers   got   caught   in   all   the   sticky   mess .   what   a   disappointment
one   word   wow   so ,   i   thought   that   the   cheap   and   average   brush   i   had   worked   well   until   i   got   this   brush !   i   applied   my   bronzer   blush   with   it   and   i   looked   practically   flawless .   i   was   shocked   at   how   bad   i   have   been   looking   compared   to   the   coverage   and   effect   this   brush   does .   i   would   say   it   is   almost   worth   the   price ,   but   luckily   i   got   mine   for   far   cheaper   on   a   different   site .   this   is   a   really   great   brush   and   i   will   seriously   cry   if   anything   happens   to   it   hahaha
best   conditioner   ever !   i   have   tried   every   conditioner   known   to   women .   when   i   wash   my   hair ,   after   i   finish   rinsing   the   shampoo   out ,   my   hair   feels   coarse   and   tangled .   i   have   used   everything   from   oil   treatments   to   leave   in   conditioners .   nothing   has   worked   in   detangling   my   hair   while   i   m   in   the   shower .   until   i   tried   a   sample   of   the   senscience   conditioner .   it   was   amazing !   my   hair   instantly   detangled   in   the   shower   and   i   mean   instantly .   so   i   immediately   went   online   to   find   this   incredible   product .   i   ordered   the   biggest   bottle   i   could   find .   my   hair   is   shiny ,   full   and   feels   incredible !   i   love   this   conditioner   and   i   am   so   grateful   i   finally   found   it !
great   product   i   have   achieved   healthy   looking   non   frizzy   hair   by   rubbing   this   oil   over   my   hands   and   cuticles ,   and   then   running   my   hands   through   my   hair .   a   little   of   this   stuff   goes   a   long   way .   i   also   love   that   this   product   has   no   fragrance   it   is   practically   odorless ,   which   makes   it   ok   to   use   around   my   chemically   sensitive   mother .   its   a   great   product .   would   buy   it   again .
works   well ...   if   it   works   at   all   i   purchased   these   clippers   about   5   months   ago   to   start   cutting   my   own   hair .   i   got   about   6   good   haircuts   with   it ,   but   unfortunately   ran   into   one   large   issue .   the   more   i   used   it ,   the   gradually   harder   it   was   to   move   the   power   switch   on   and   off .   eventually ,   the   power   switch   jammed   completely ,   and   i   was   no   longer   able   to   turn   the   thing   on .   i   sent   the   clipper   to   wahl   to   get   it   repaired ,   paying   around   15   dollars   for   shipping ,   and   got   it   back   around   2   weeks   later .   i   used   the   clippers   twice   since   then ,   and   now   the   power   switch   is   back   to   being   jammed .   this   thing   is   no   better   than   a   paper   weight   to   me   now .   i   really   regret   purchasing   this   clipper ,   and   will   be   purchasing   a   new   pair   from   a   different   brand   sometime   very   soon .
lasts   no   longer   than   an   emery   board ,   let   alone   a   file .   it   took   a   single   filing   of   ten   nails   to   remove   all   of   the   abrasive   material   at   the   edges   of   the   file .   this   product   lasts   no   longer   than   an   emery   board   and   no   where   near   as   long   as   a   regular   metal   file .
not   my   favorite   goes   on   thick   and   doesn   t   blend   in   to   skin .   i   also   got   some   sun   burn .
too   faced   lip   injection   extreme   the   real   sham ! !   save   you   money ! !   nothing   but   slick   goo   on   the   lips .   no   plumping ! !
disappointing   i   was   really   excited   about   this   product   as   i   am   a   firm   believer   in   the   benefits   of   tea   tree   oil .   the   scent   was   mild   and   to   my   liking .   however   the   effects   wore   off   in   a   few   hours   a   much   shorter   time   than   my   fragrance   free   crystal   deoderant   which   contains   only   natural   mineral   salts .   while   at   work   i   could   actually   smell   myself   to   the   point   of   embarrassment   as   i   felt   sure   that   others   were   also   smelling   me !   this   from   some   one   with   a   naturally   mild   body   odor   and   body   chemistry .   i   tried   it   at   least   3   times ,   hoping   that   i   was   mistaken   but   the   same   thing   happened   every   time .   since   it   came   in   a   packet   of   4 ,   i   gave   them   to   my   husband .   it   seems   to   be   working   a   bit   better   for   him ,   but   the   effects   are   still   for   a   fairly   short   duration .   if   you   have   a   shower   every   4   5   hours   or   so   though ,   this   product   may   be   the   perfect   one   to   get .
wonderful   product   i   am   verry   happy   with   body   time   spray   on   natural   body   moisturizer !   i   was   a   faithful   user   of   nivea   spray   on   moisturizer   for   several   years .   unfortunately ,   nivea   discontinued   this   product .   after   an   internet   search ,   i   located   body   time   spray   on   natural   body   moisturizer ,   and   immediately   ordered   two   bottles .   in   my   opinion   body   time   is   better   than   nivea .   i   will   continue   to   purchase   this   product ,   and   i   have   recommended   it   to   my   girlfriends .   renate   wagner
not   just   for   blondes !   i   have   fine   black   hair   and   i   love   this   product .   i   spritz   it   on   before   blow   drying .   i   can   definitely   tell   the   difference   when   i   don   t   use   it .   it   adds   body   and   it   feels   light .   to   keep   the   volume   i   use   elnett   hairspray   to   finish   the   look .
perfect   smoky   eye   color !   i   ve   been   using   this   shade   for   almost   18   months ,   almost   every   day .   i   use   a   little   for   office   wear   and   more   for   more   dramatic   night   smoky   eye .   it   goes   on   perfectly ,   and   has   just   enough   shimmer .   it   s   my   all   time   favorite   eyeshadow !
worst   shaver   ever   this   had   both   good   and   bad   reviews ,   so   i   figured   i   would   give   it   a   try .   mistake .   worst   shaver   ever .   i   had   to   take   off   the   plastic   piece   and   just   use   the   blades   to   make   the   hair   short   enough ,   and   it   worked   for   about   2   minutes ,   and   then   suddenly   all   it   did   was   pull   the   hair   and   hurt ! ! !   don   t   waste   your   money .
best   mascara !   i   have   very   sensitive   eyes   and   this   is   the   perfect   product   for   me .   i   ve   had   it   for   about   a   year   a   half   and   recently   purchased   another   mascara   to   replace   it .   i   didn   t   realize   how   good   i   had   it !   this   mascara   has   a   thin   brush   that   makes   it   easy   to   apply   with   precision ,   goes   on   without   clumps ,   has   a   very   natural   look   and   best   of   all ,   i   don   t   need   makeup   remover   to   get   it   off !   i   didn   t   even   own   any   until   i   tried   out   my   new   stuff   and   had   massive   raccoon   eyes   .   sure ,   the   little   lash   tubes   can   look   creepy   coming   off ,   may   stick   to   your   cheeks   or   the   sink   a   little ,   but   it   s   worth   it   to   not   have   to   rub   my   eyes   with   make   up   remover   and   have   puffy   red   eyes   after .   it   s   the   only   kind   i   ll   buy   again !
great   night   moisturizer   i   have   oily   skin   on   to   of   dry   skin ,   therefore ,   makes   it   very   hard   to   find   a   good   skincare   line .   i   get   so   tired   of   trying   out   skincare   products   made   for   combination   skin   normal   oily   .   face   creams   for   dry   skin   is   just   too   much   moisture   and   oil   for   my   type   of   skin .   finding   good   all   natural   skincare   is   even   harder .   i   use   pangea   organics   line   for   the   day   time .   i   use   this   oil   for   night   because   i   wake   up   with   very   oily   and   very   dry   skin .   using   this   actually   helps   reduce   this   and   makes   my   skin   feel   so   much   softer .   it   s   hard   for   me   blend   this   oil   on   my   face   alone   without   using   more   than   2   drops .   so ,   i   mix   this   in   with   my   pangea   organics   face   lotion   at   night   and   wake   up   with   refreshed   looking   skin .   i   haven   t   tried   using   this   oil   in   the   day   time   since   i   get   the   midday   oil   slick ,   but   i   hear   argan   oil   reduces   the   oiliness   without   drying   the   skin .   here   s   another   bonus ,   my   skin   tend   to   get   flushed   in   the   afternoon ,   like   as   if   i   just   ran   a   marathon .   using   this   argan   oil   reduced   the   redness .   one   of   the   reviewer   says   it   might   not   be   pure   because   it   is   fragrance   free ,   instead   will   try   one   that   has   the   fragrance .   i   don   t   doubt   this   is   product   is   of   lesser   quality   because   the   information   supplied   by   slice   of   nature   says   that   there   are   3   processing   types   for   argan   oil .   one   of   them   is   make   argan   oil   fragrance   free   and   most   of   the   time   comes   out   clear .   the   other   type   of   processing   keeps   the   fragrance   and   the   color   is   yellow   or   darker   and   it   is   mostly   used   for   cooking ,   maybe   for   cosmetics .   i   personally   don   t   want   to   put   cooking   oil   on   my   skin ,   since   cooking   oil   can   go   rancid   very   quickly .   that   s   like   saying   that   i   will   put   grapeseed   cooking   oil   for   my   body .   would   you   do   this   this   one   from   watt   s   beauty   is   clear   and   it   is   contained   in   a   very   simple   and   plain   brown   bottle   with   a   dropper ,   which   is   very   useful .   as   always   with   any   consumer   products ,   it   s   always   either   you   like   it   or   you   don   t .   i   personally   like   this   and   will   continue   to   use   it .   i   haven   t   tried   using   this   on   my   hair   or   on   my   body .   my   hair   is   pretty   normal .   i   do   intend   on   using   this   with   my   body   lotion   very   soon .
leaves   hair   squeaky   clean   i   m   a   guy   who   s   pretty   much   fine   with   head   and   shoulders   as   a   shampoo   of   choice   so   i   m   not   particularly   discriminating .   i   have   fairly   thick   hair   that   i   keep   mine   cut   short   so   if   pro   v   was   going   to   give   my   hair   volume   i   would   hardly   notice .   overall   i   was   pleased   with   the   shampoo   and   it   literally   left   my   hair   squeaky   clean .   i   m   not   sure   if   that   s   necessarily   a   good   thing   since   according   to   my   wife   that   squeak   is   caused   when   shampoo   strips   the   oil   from   your   hair .   i   needed   to   continue   to   use   my   head   and   shoulders   occasionally   because   the   pro   v   doesn   t   seem   to   help   with   dandruff .   the   pro   v   was   fine   but   i   didn   t   notice   a   huge   difference   with   other   shampoos .
we   are   men   here .   i   was   excited   the   first   time   i   used   this   razor   because   it   shaves   so   close .   br   by   the   end   of   the   day   my   throat   and   neck   area   was   extremely   irritated   and   i   had   hundreds   of   ingrown   hairs .   br   thanks   for   the   extremely   close   shave !   br   i   was   so   embarrassed   when   i   went   to   my   girlfriend   s   house   that   night .   br   i   like   my   face   to   be   clean   and   smooth   but   this   is   just   too   close   of   a   shave .   br   also   i   must   note   that   the   blade   gets   worn   down   very   easily   and   gets   clogged   with   shaving   cream   hair .
not   bad   have   only   used   once   but   have   high   expectations .   smell   was   not   really   so   great   but   not   horrible .   the   after   tan   smell   that   burnt   hair   smell   was   not   bad   at   all .   so   well   worth   it   there .   i   could   still   smell   it   but   it   wasnt   overpowering   like   most   lotions   are .   gave   me   good   color   right   out   of   the   bed   but   not   the   best .   br   br   i   still   think   worship   me   does   a   much   better   job   giving   you   color   right   out   of   the   bed ... i   looked   like   a   goddess   of   the   islands   after   using   that   just   once !   also   worship   me   smells   better .   but   meh ,   i   ll   try   this   and   see .   br   br   hope   it   works ! ! !
unannounced   formula   change   i   have   used   retro   daily   shampoo   for   a   few   years   and   was   delighted   with   it ,   in   particular   because   it   contained   no   sulfates .   unfortunately   the   retro   i   received   had   a   label   new   improved   formula   on   front   and   when   i   read   the   ingredients   i   discovered   they   have   added   sulfates   to   the   shampoo .   i   therefore   had   to   return   it   and   although   the   retrun   experience   was   good   i   was   disappointed   in   the   change   in   the   product .
best   brush   i   could   find   on   amazon   the   only   reason   i   didn   t   give   it   5   stars   is   because   i   agree   with   some   of   the   other   reviews ,   it   should   be   longer .   i   wish   about   4   inches   longer ,   and   it   d   be   perfect !   however ,   its   not   a   huge   issue ,   when   i   use   it   in   the   shower   i   can   scrub   my   back   from   above   my   shoulder ,   and   then   from   below   to   get   my   lower   back .   br   br   also ,   you   can   t   tell   from   the   pictures ,   but   the   brush   needles   are   held   in   place   by   glue ,   not   staples   as   i   think   someone   else   had   written .   no   rust   should   occur   on   this   since   it   s   all   plastic .
great   cream !   thank   you ! !   the   cream   was   delivered   earlier   than   expected   .. and   it   works   so   well ,   my   scars   lightened   noticeably   within   a   weak .. now   it   can   hardly   be   seenn ! !   i   will   definitely   buy   from   you   again ! ! !
we   love   it   i   add   the   conditioner   to   my   routine .   my   husband   found   that   it   really   helped   when   he   use   both   the   shampoo   and   the   conditioner   and   left   the   conditioner   on   for   a   couple   of   minutes
a   step   up   from   level   6   i   stepped   to   level   9 ,   after   using   level   6   for   about   eight   months .   once   i   stepped   up   i   finally   began   to   see   wrinkles   become   less   prominent ,   and   my   acne   more   manageable .   however ,   my   skin   became   so   red   and   irritated   and   my   usually   oily   skin   began   to   dry   out .   the   results   i   did   see   were   not   worth   the   side   effects   and   were   not   worth   the   money .   green   cream   in   general   has   a   high   alcohol   content ,   and   i   first   became   aware   of   this   when   i   started   using   level   9   and   found   out   this   is   what   was   most   likely   making   my   skin   dry .   there   are   far   better   retinol   treatments   on   the   market ,   especially   for   the   amount   that   is   paid   for   these   products .
only   works   if ...   i   use   this   product   along   with   conditioner   and   blowout   serum .   i   got   the   brazilian   blowout   treatment   in   my   hair   and   it   s   just   phenomenal   how   i   don   t   have   to   worry   about   my   hair   anymore .   i   do   recommend   the   treatment   before   purchasing   the   shampoo ,   conditioner ,   and   serum .   after   all ,   the   only   reason   to   purchase   these   outrageously   expensive   products   is   to   maintain   the   treatment   longer .   i   m   very   happy   with   the   treatment   300   600 ,   depending   on   length   ,   but   i   am   not   very   happy   with   the   products .   they   do   leave   a   lot   of   dandruff .   but   if   you   paid   for   the   brazilian   blowout   treatment   ,   might   as   well   maintain   it   by   using   the   correct   products .   i   will   only   continue   to   purchase   this   product   as   long   as   i   keep   getting   the   brazilian   blowout   treatments .
didn   t   work   this   product   was   very   dry ,   it   seemed   old   and   really   did   not   work   at   all ,   i   do   not   recommend ,   waste   of   money
great   stuff   if   you   love   vanilla ,   you   will   love   this   essential   oil !   i   m   glad   i   bought   this
love   it ! !   i   had   purchases   matte   polish   previously   so   i   know   that   it   doesnt   last   as   long ,   but   its   better   than   what   other   reviews   are   saying .   i   love   the   color   and   the   matte   finish   is   great !   i   have   been   wearing   it   for   4   days   and   no   chips   so   far !   you   just   have   to   put   one   thin   coat   on   and   it   wont   come   of   in   huge   flakes .
good   for   one   use ...   these   flower   shaped   toe   separators   are   super   cute   and   they   work   fine   to   separate   your   toes   to   polish   but   when   you   take   them   off ,   the   flowers   easily   rip   off   making   them   good   for   one   use .   i   ll   have   to   sacrifice   esthetics   and   go   with   the   plain   old   separators   next   time .
works   great !   at   first   i   was   kind   of   scared   to   get   one   of   these   for   cheap ,   bc   i   m   scared   to   get   cut .   but   fortunately   this   price   is   great ,   and   it   works   fantastic .   i   love   it ! ! !   and   it   comes   with   10   replacement   blades !   it   s   a   great   deal !

too   bad   the   container   is   poorly   designed !   about   two   years   ago ,   i   discovered   this   product   and   fell   in   love   quickly   only   to   be   disappointed .   as   a   frequent   dry   shampoo   user ,   i   have   to   say   this   one   has   the   freshest   shampoo   like   scent   and   it   really   works   without   leaving   a   residue .   the   problem ,   which   i   am   unable   to   overcome ,   is   the   issue   with   the   sprayer   getting   clogged .   luckily ,   i   bought   my   product   from   a   local   cosmetics   shop   and   they   allowed   me   to   return   four   bottles   in   a   row .   i   tried   hot   water ,   i   tried   cleaning   the   nozzle .   i   never   tried   sticking   an   earring   in   it   like   another   reviewer   suggested ,   but   i   had   enough .   probably   because   of   their   embarassment ,   one   of   the   cosmetic   store   employees   told   me   they   had   heard   ojan   was   improving   their   bottle .   so   i   waited   diligently   for   about   a   year   before   purchasing   another   bottle   only   to   find   that ,   just   like   before ,   after   about   2   uses ,   the   nozzle   clogs .   dear   ojan   please   improve   your   packaging   design   so   i   can   continue   to   use   your   product ! ! !   it   is   a   horrible   design   flaw   that   has   to   cost   a   ton   of   money   in   returns   and   in   loss   of   potential   return   customers   like   me !   now   i   use   oscar   blandi   s   power ,   which   is   a   fabulous   product ,   but   sprays   are   just   a   little   better .   i   have   heard   similar   reports   in   blandi   s   spray   and   have   avoided   it   as   a   result .   fuhrer   s   didn   t   really   do   much   for   me   and   a   drugstore   brand   named   salon   grafix   sg   works   effectively   but   smells   like   old   lady   hairspray .
arrival   prompt   very   happy   with   the   seller ,   the   product   is   awesome   too .   the   seller   had   this   to   me   from   ca   before   i   got   the   shipment   notification ! !   very   please   will   shop   again .
great   in   theory ,   but   execution   fabrication   is   lacking .   the   hot   spot   s   technology   works ,   it   does   help   shorten   the   life   span   of   pimples   and   help   prevent   breakouts   from   erupting .   however ,   the   construction   of   this   item   is   subpar   the   plastic   casing   cracks   after   the   first   three   uses ,   and   in   some   cases   renders   it   useless .   i   don   t   expect   something   i   paid   40   to   break   within   a   week   of   purchase .   i   emailed   zeno   s   customer   service   to   complain   about   the   poor   quality ,   and   received   a   response   that   they   were   aware   of   the   cracking   issue   and   were   working   on   improving   the   product   which   does   no   good   for   those   of   us   who   got   the   lousy   ones .
perfect   the   item   i   received   was   perfect   for   what   i   needed   it   for .   i   am   making   a   costume   for   my   sister .   fairly   sturdy   and   comes   with   ribbon   around   it .   a   cute   touch .   very   cute   and   perfect   for   a   costume .   not   so   sure   about   a   formal   event   since   it   is   felt   but   i   was   very   happy   about   my   order .   ordered   from   911costume .   very   fast   shipping .
great   short   hair   clipper   after   several   failed   attempts   trying   to   buy   a   remington   shortcut   that   would   hold   a   charge ,   i   stumbled   onto   the   philips   norelco   qc5170 .   it   is   by   far   the   best   hair   clipper   i   have   ever   owned .   first   things   first ... this   baby   holds   a   charge !   it   has   over   an   hour   of   run   time   on   a   full   charge .   and   if   the   charge   does   run   out ,   it   works   with   its   ac   charger   plugged   in .   so   you   re   never   stuck   with   half   a   haircut   and   a   dead   set   of   clippers .   the   cutter   is   powerful .   the   blades   move   fast   so   they   don   t   pull   your   hair ,   they   cut   it .   its   adjustable   cut   settings   and   its   pivoting   spacer   comb   combine   to   produce   a   great ,   easy   haircut .   i   also   use   it   to   trim   my   beard .   the   primary   spacer   comb   easily   pops   off   for   easy   cleaning ,   or   to   attach   one   of   the   specialty   combs   and   cutters   that   also   come   with   it .   i   enthusiastically   recommend   this   product .
great !   my   last   penlet   died   pretty   quickly .   this   one   seems   a   lot   more   solid   and   has   been   working   great .   i   hope   it   lasts   a   long   time .   i   don   t   want   to   have   to   be   buying   a   new   one   every   few   months .
fowl   smelling   and   burns   skin   i   have   been   using   this   conditioner   for   years   including   a   few   bottles   i   ve   purchased   from   amazon   and   directly   from   bumble   and   bumble .   the   last   bottle   i   got   from   amazon   smelled   like   nail   polish   and   burned   my   skin .   clearly   a   counterfeit   version   has   ended   up   in   their   supply   chain .
great   product ,   i   highly   recommend   it !   i   found   this   product   by   accident   while   trying   to   find   a   certain   brand   of   make   up   on   amazon   because   of   the   price   reviews   i   decided   to   purchase   it   for   my   17   year   old   daughter ,   who   is   really   into   pretty   eye   shadows ..   i   have   spent   a   fortune   on   colorful   name   brand   eyeshadows   at   the   store !   i   have   to   say ,   my   daughter   loves   this   eye   shadow !   i   just   purchased   2   more   of   these   eye   shadow   palettes   one   for   me   another   for   her   will   continue   to   buy   them !   the   palette   came   wrapped   tight   in   bubble   wrap   all   88   shades   were   in   perfect   condition !   i   also   love   the   way   they   are   packaged ,   slim   enough   to   throw   in   your   purse   but   large   enough   when   you   open   it   that   you   can   easily   use   the   inside   mirror   to   put   on   the   eye   shadow ,   and   talk   about   color   options ,   wow !   they   are   very   vibrant ,   beautiful   colors .   it   would   also   make   a   great   affordable   gift   for   anyone   you   know   who   loves   to   have   fun   with   eye   shadow !
great   product   this   facial   sunblock   is   easy   to   rub   in ,   non   greasy   or   oily   which   is   great   for   me   because   i   sometimes   break   out   ,   and   doesn   t   irritate .   in   the   summer ,   i   use   this   as   a   moisturizer   after   washing   my   face   in   the   morning   and   then   reapply   if   i   m   in   the   sun   for   extended   periods .   it   was   rated   highly   on   the   environmental   working   group   ewg   website   as   it   contains   no   carcinogens   and   minimal   toxins   it   s   impossibly   for   a   sunblock   to   be   completely   free   of   toxins   and   actually   work   .   it   s   a   broad   spectrum   sunblock   as   well   which   means   that   it   protects   well   against   a   large   range   of   uvb   and   uva   wavelengths   of   light .   highly   recommended  
best   10   bucks   you   ll   spend   simply   put .   youngest   daughter   wouldn   t   stop .   tried   everything .   2   days ! ! ! !   it   s   tastes   horrid ,   and   doesn   t   go   away   equals   strong   incentive   not   to   put   your   thumb   in   there .
smells   amazing   and   works   well   too !   i   love   the   korres   fig   items .   they   truly   smell   like   you   just   got   a   whiff   of   a   fresh   fig !   the   body   butter   is   paraben   free   and   really   saves   dry   skin .   i   got   a   lot   of   sun   this   summer   and   this   takes   the   dry   skin   right   away .   i   love   it !
a   great   product !   i   ve   been   using   henna   hair   dye   for   a   few   months   now .   my   hair   feels   so   much   healthier   than   when   i   used   regular   hair   dye .   it   s   a   bit   messy   using   it ,   but   you   adjust   and   i   am   pleased   with   the   final   outcome !
i   love   this   thing !   it   s   a   great   item .   it   dries   super   quick !   i   never   have   to   waste   time   waiting   for   nail   polish   to   dry   again !   yay ! ! !
works   well   after   reading   many   reviews ,   i   decided   to   get   this   one .   i   ve   been   using   a   variety   of   different   ones   and   most   work   pretty   well .   this   one   continues   that   trend .   it   cuts   well   and   is   easy   to   maintain .   the   only   downsides   is   that   it   might   get   a   little   warmer   louder   than   what   i   remember   of   the   others   i   ve   used   and   without   a   guard ,   it   doesn   t   get   quite   as   close   as   some   of   the   other   clippers .   i   d   recommend   it   for   anyone   who   isn   t   looking   for   a   really   close   cut .
excellent   product !   we   ve   only   used   this   a   few   times   but   we   have   not   gotten   sunburn   at   all   and   i   can   feel   pretty   good   about   the   ingredients ,   especially   for   kids .
i   love   it ... great   colors ,   liners ,   and   blush   i   love   it .   bought   it   with   book   on   makeup   and   i   use   it   to   create   beautiful   styles .   it   has   blush ,   liners   and   eyebrow   quality   colors .   then   lots   of   eyeshadows .   i   really   love   it   and   enjoy   every   color .
i   love   my   hair   now ! ! ! !   i   am   in   love   with   wen !   i   have   very   thin   hair   and   was   starting   to   loose   a   little   every   week   or   so .   it   has   stopped   falling   out   and   my   hair   looks   and   feels   great .

makes   noise   but   nothing   else ! !   i   bought   this   and   tried   it   thinking   wahl   was   a   good   brand .   this   thing   is   horrible ! ! !   it   does   not   cut   hair .   it   s   truly   like   the   blades   are   missing .   don   t   waste   your   time .
great   blades   derby   extra   razors   are   the   perfect   razors   for   a   beginning   double   edge   shaver .   i   had   tried   my   razor   with   the   factory   merkur   blade ,   and   i   got   a   half   decent   shave ,   but   i   had   to   be   very   careful   because   the   blade   would   randomly   dig   into   my   skin .   i   switched   to   derby ,   and   what   a   difference   a   derby   makes .   br   br   the   blades   are   very   sharp   my   wife   tested   them   gently   dry   shaving   a   bit   of   leg   hair ,   and   they   left   an   instant   bald   spot .   however ,   they   re   not   too   sharp   as   some   people   have   said   a   feather   blade   can   be   i   can   even   press   down   on   my   razor   just   a   bit   in   trouble   areas   to   get   really   close   results ,   and   not   have   to   worry   too   much   about   slicing   myself   open .   br   br   if   you   re   just   starting   out   with   double   edge   shaving ,   do   yourself   a   favor   and   pick   up   some   derby   blades .   the   only   reason   i   ll   consider   switching   potentially   to   find   a   razor   with   more   economical   packaging .   derby   blades   come   in   little   plastic   mini   tubs   that   are   individually   wrapped ,   not   to   mention   the   blades   are   also   individually   wrapped .   i   would   prefer   to   be   a   touch   more   environmentally   conscious   and   get   a   paper   sleeve   full   of   razors   instead   of   six   plastic   boxes .   br   br   when   packaging   is   your   biggest   concern   about   a   product ,   you   know   there   s   good   product   in   there .   recommended   for   beginning   shavers ,   or   anyone   looking   for   a   good   workhorse   blade .
not   as   good   as   it   looks   looks   great   and   presented   excellent ...   but   this   item   must   be   turned   off   completely   after   each   use   near   where   the   unit   was   installed   at   the   rear   of   the   toliet   near   the   floor ! !   you   and   or   your   guests   have   to   remember   this .   stated   in   the   directions   in   asia   where   these   are   very   popular   you   do   not   have   to   turn   the   unit   off   after   each   use .   mine   leaks   a   little   either   in   the   open   postion   or   closed   postion   while   hanging   on   the   wall ! ! !   i   would   say   to   look   for   a   better   unit   before   buying   this   one   i   was   very   dissappointed   in   the   quality .
terrible   shaving   system   i   have   been   shaving   with   braun   products   for   35   years ,   and   have   always   been   pleased ,   with   the   exception   of   the   price   for   the   replacement   cutters   foils .   br   however ,   this   particular   product   is   awful ,   it   does   not   shave   close   enough ,   and   good   luck   finding   replacement   cutters   locally .   br   thankfully   i   saved   my   old   braun   shaver ,   and   as   much   as   i   tried   to   use   this   one   it   was   a   gift   i   eventually   went   back   to   my   old   one .
hydrience   014   i   was   so   glad   to   find   my   color   online ,   because   they   no   longer   stock   it   in   my   area .   br   thanks ,   the   items   was   in   great   condition   when   it   arrived .   cost   a   bit   more   than   in   the   store   was   about   8   each   here   .
love   it   i   have   this   lipstick   in   rose   brown   and   i   love   it ... such   a   subtle   and   pretty   color .   i   wish   the   staying   power   of   this   product   was   a   bit   better ,   but   other   than   that ,   i   can   t   complain .

i   love   the   znp   bar   but .....   its   expensive .   definitely   effective   for   seborrhoeic   dermatitis .   my   only   complaint   is   that   its   expensive .   however ,   the   bar   lasts   forever .

australian   gold   aloe   freeze   spray   gel   i   originally   purchased   this   product   for   sunburn   relief   and   loved   it .   it   is   the   one   product   that   not   only   helped   ease   the   pain   and   discomfort   of   sunburn ,   but   you   don   t   have   to   rub   the   product   into   sensitive   sunburnt   skin .   it   absorbs   into   your   skin   in   seconds !   what   a   relief !   i   also   found   other   uses   for   it .   in   the   winter ,   when   dry   skin   is   more   prominent ,   just   spray   it   on   and   it   has   the   same   relieving   effect .   now ,   i   don   t   even   buy   hair   conditioner   it   even   works   as   that !   so   for   around   9.00   a   bottle ,   you   really   have   3   products   in   one !   what   a   bargain !

excellent   watch   i   purchased   this   watch   for   a   legally   blind ,   elderly   friend   of   mine .   the   watch   is   just   like   the   one   radio   shack   use   to   sell .   this   watch   is   far   superior   to   the   new   watch   radio   shack   is   selling .   it   can   be   heard   loud   and   clear ,   and   it   is   easy   to   use .   i   would   recommend   it   for   any   one   with   vision   problems .
does   a   very   good   job   i   am   a   female   and   i   bought   this   shaver   for   my   bikini   and   genital   area .   i   personally   think   it   does   a   better   job   on   the   genital   area   than   on   the   bikini   area .   it   really   makes   a   difference   at   what   angles   your   hair   grows ,   and   if   your   hair   is   on   the   smoother   side   and   grows   very   parallel   to   your   skin   like   it   does   on   the   areas   that   would   show   right   around   my   bikini   line   ,   it   s   tough   to   get   it   all   with   this   shaver .   it   does   a   good   job   on   the   more   coarse   hair   in   more   intimate   areas ,   as   those   stand   at   more   of   a   perpendicular   angle   especially   when   they   re   short   and   stubbly   after   having   been   shaved   a   few   days   before   .   you   will   have   to   pull   gently   at   your   skin   and   or   hold   it   in   a   kind   of   pinched   way   sometimes   to   make   sure   you   get   all   of   the   hairs   at   an   angle   the   shaver   will   reach ,   but   none   of   that   is   painful   and   it   does   work .   you   ll   also   have   to   go   over   each   area   more   than   once ,   so   plan   on   devoting   a   few   minutes   to   the   process   more   than   that   for   your   first   time   or   two   ,   because   you   won   t   be   able   to   get   it   all   super   quickly   with   the   multiple   runs   over   areas   and   the   need   to   stretch   and   pull   your   skin .   i   haven   t   really   had   any   experiences   of   it   pinching   or   nicking   my   skin .   do   use   some   sort   of   baby   powder ,   particularly   in   damper   areas   to   make   the   skin   dry   and   easy   to   run   the   shaver   over .   i   use   a   compressed   air   can ,   along   with   the   little   cleaning   brush   that   comes   with   it ,   to   clean   it   after   each   use .   i   don   t   think   the   brush   does   a   thorough   job   on   its   own .   overall   i   m   quite   happy   with   this   product   and   would   recommend   it   as   a   worthwhile   purchase .   i   have   to   use   it   pretty   much   every   day   to   stay   truly   smooth ,   and   there   are   a   couple   tiny   areas   that   i   tend   to   run   a   razor   over   going   in   the   same   direction   as   the   hair   so   it   won   t   create   razor   burn   after   using   the   shaver   just   because   the   hair   in   those   places   isn   t   at   enough   of   an   angle   for   the   shaver   to   really   reach .   you   would   definitely   need   to   use   a   trimmer   to   get   the   hair   to   a   short   stubble   before   using   this   shaver   i   opted   for   actually   shaving   everything   with   a   razor   first ,   and   then   using   the   shaver   to   shave   the   stubble   once   it   started   growing   back   a   day   or   two   later ,   and   have   continued   doing   that   stubble   maintenance   ever   since .   the   battery   life   is   also   pretty   good .   i   ve   had   the   razor   for   about   six   months   now   and   have   changed   the   batteries   only   once   so   far ,   probably   a   couple   of   months   in ,   while   using   it   every   few   days .
awesome   product !   this   is   a   great   product .   although   a   bit   pricey   a   little   goes   a   long   way   and   i   love   the   way   it   helps   your   hair   dry   faster .   not   sure   how   it   works ,   but   it   does .   although   the   product   says   it   is   oil   my   hair   is   never   greasy   feeling   and   feels   great !   i   would   certainly   recommend   it   for   longer   hair .
hard   to   tolerate ,   but   i   hope   they   work .   i   tried   these   for   about   three   days   and   found   them   difficult   to   tolerate .   the   bottom   strip   is   especially   challenging   to   get   on   right ,   and   they   make   me   salivate   for   the   30   minutes   i   have   them   in ,   and   leave   goop   behind .   i   have   to   really   motivate   myself   to   use   them ,   and   have   several   times   wondered   if   my   teeth   aren   t   already   white   enough .   my   dentist   recommended   them ,   so   they   probably   do   work   if   you   can   stick   with   the   regimen .   i   haven   t   been   able   to   so   far .
they   don   t   make   them   to   last   anymore .   my   30   year   old   norelco   died   and   they   don   t   make   the   repair   parts .   my   old   norelco   worked   fine   with   the   original   heads   until   the   motor   quit .   br   br   the   current   model   is   cheap   in   price   and   feels   poorly   made .   they   recommend   replacing   the   heads   annually ,   but   i   ll   use   it   until   it   fails   and   then   toss   it .
soft   and   shiny   hair   my   hairdresser   recommended   this   oil   while   i   was   at   the   shop   one   day .   she   stated   it   was   the   only   product   from   which   she   got   results   after   chemo .   it   makes   my   hair   soft   and   manageable .   i   don   t   have   frizzies   and   it   does   not   weigh   my   hair   down .   not   only   is   it   great   for   my   hair   but   its   good   for   my   skin .   the   fragerance   is   clean   and   fresh .
my   least   favorite   of   crest   s   whitestrips   i   have   used   several   kinds   of   crest   whitestrips ,   from   the   original   to   the   pro   to   the   advanced   and   other   varieties .   i   love   them ,   even   the   original   strips   work   great .   these   5   minute   strips ,   however ,   i   was   not   impressed   with   and   found   them   to   be   pretty   much   ineffective .   my   advice   to   those   with   sensitive   teeth   rather   than   buying   these   strips ,   buy   the   originals   or   an   upgraded   version   and   use   them   less   often   than   as   directed   to   reduce   sensitivity .   use   them   once   every   few   days   or   once   a   week   rather   than   the   recommended   once   or   twice   a   day .   you   will   still   get   great   results ,   but   giving   your   teeth   a   break   in   between   uses   will   dramatically   decrease   any   pain   from   sensitivity .
a   must   have   for   sensitive   teeth   and   no   soft   function   on   brush   when   i   had   moved   in   with   my   gf ,   she   had   brought   along   one   of   those   cheap   oral   b   vitality   electric   toothbrushes .   she   had   purchased   a   three   pack   of   the   floss   action   heads ,   so   i   decided   to   use   it   to   keep   up   with   my   teeth   hygiene .   well   my   background   is   using   the   sensitive   function   on   a   more   expensive   oral   b   electric   toothbrush .   well   let   me   just   say   that   that   experience   was   well   learned   and   a   lesson   that   i   learned   that   i   needed   a   sensitive   tooth   brush   head .   the   oral   b   only   has   an   on   and   off   function ,   so   there   is   no   calming   down   the   motor   in   it .   the   floss   action   was   just   to   hard   on   my   teeth .   i   am   a   young   guy ,   but   i   am   just   so   blessed   with   sensitive   teeth .   so   i   decided   to   purchase   this   through   amazon   since   this   was   the   best   price   around .   when   i   got   it   i   went   home   after   work   and   tried   it   out .   wow   what   a   difference   between   this   and   the   floss   action ,   as   well   as   just   a   manual   toothbrush .   i   didnt   get   any   pains   at   all   from   using   it ,   and   now   several   weeks   in   and   still   no   side   effects   from   using   it .   i   can   now   truly   appreciate   the   cleaning   power   of   the   toothbrush   itself .   i   would   totally   recommend   this   to   anyone   who   cannot   afford   one   of   the   high   end   electric   toothbrushes   with   a   sensitive   mode .
it   does   what   it   says .   this   product   has   delivered   higher   results   than   i   expected .   this   was   my   third   purchase   i   take   the   recommended   six   tablets   per   day   i   m   in   my   fourth   month   of   using   this   supplement   and   i   plan   to   continue   with   it ,   indefinitely .   initially ,   there   was   a   substantial   weight   loss   a   little   too   much   for   me   but   i   ve   since   regained   what   i   needed .   my   fine   hair   seems   no   thicker   but   where   there   was   a   noticeable   receding   hairline ,   all   the   hair   has   regrown   and   that   sure   is   wonderful .   complexion   and   fingernails   show   nice   improvements ,   but   the   most   remarkable   for   me   is   that   i   no   longer   need   to   wear   supports   for   my   ankles   when   i   m   active .   i   suffered   a   degree   of   permanent   damage   to   the   tendons   in   both   ankles   many   years   ago ,   to   the   point   that   i   had   to   be   careful   just   getting   out   of   bed   in   the   morning .   now ,   i   am   pain   free   and   enjoy   wearing   the   shoes   of   my   choice .   overall ,   i   credit   this   product   with   substantial   improvement   to   the   quality   of   my   life   and   i   would   highly   recommend   giving   it   a   try .
not   a   miracle   worker ,   but   very   clean   skin   i   haven   t   seen   any   of   the   great   skin   improvements   that   are   supposed   to   come   with   a   clarisonic ,   but   i   do   feel   as   though   my   face   is   very ,   very   clean   when   i   m   done   using   it ,   and   that   s   a   good   enough   reason   to   have   it   in   my   book .
lovely   shade !   this   color   is   awesome ,   you   won   t   find   any   like   it .   it   s   a   very   sweet   almost   turquoise   green .   i   have   had   a   lot   of   compliments   on   it .   br   the   application   was   a   bit   streaky   so   i   had   to   use   3   coats ,   but   the   finish   was   real   good .   br   add   a   glossy   top   coat   to   it   and   it   looks   like   a   jelly   bean   on   your   hand !

spa   purifying   facial   with   sea   mud   i   received   this   product   and   enjoyed   using   this !   i   was   expecting   a   quicker   result .   it   wasn   t   a   miracle   worker   for   me .   beth
just   finished   my   first   self   haircut .   i   can   t   believe   how   easy   this   is .   i   just   finished   my   first   haircut .   took   me   maybe   10   minutes   tops .   did   it   entirely   by   myself ,   and   i   can   t   say   there   is   any   real   difference   between   what   i   feel   and   see   in   the   mirror   from   when   the   barber   did   it .   and   no   one   else   has   noticed   any   difference   or   mentioned   it .   i   always   told   my   barber   anyway   not   to   shave   over   the   ears   and   around   the   back   just   at   the   bottom   of   my   sideburns .   i   am   delighted   i   made   this   purchase .   i   would   not   recommend   this   to   anyone   who   has   hair   much   longer   than   a   crewcut ,   however .
love   it !   i   was   actually   wearing   this   color   when   i   had   my   daughter   who   is   now   2   ,   so   i   have   an   emotional   connection .   honestly   though ,   it   is   a   great   color .   if   you   are   familiar   with   opi   you   know   it   is   a   quality   product .   the   color   is   very   girly   without   reminding   you   of   little   girls .   it   has   the   maturity   behind   it   i   guess   you   would   say !   i   love   love   love   it   and   i   was   so   glad   to   find   it   as   it   is   discontinued !
finally ,   a   non   greasy   moisturizer   i   have   been   searching   high   and   low   for   a   moisturizer   that   won   t   leave   me   feeling   like   a   greased   up   pig .   i   have   tried   several ,   including   a   myriad   of   non   greasy   moisturizers .   so   far ,   nothing   has   worked   as   advertised .   my   dermatologist   recommended   this .   miraculously ,   this   actually   absorbs   within   minutes ,   and   does   not   leave   a   greasy   feeling   at   all .   of   course ,   there   is   a   trade   off .   if   you   have   very   dry   skin ,   you   will   have   to   use   this   3   4   times   a   day   to   really   be   effective .   less ,   if   your   dryness   isn   t   that   bad .   it   has   no   smell ,   and   won   t   aggravate   acne .   really   tho ,   the   only   thing   i   care   about   is   how   fast   it   absorbs .   as   long   as   i   use   it   regularly ,   it   keeps   my   skin   nicely   moisturized .   i   definitely   recommend   this   to   anyone   who   also   needs   a   non   greasy   moisturizer .
soft ,   soft ,   soft   i   bought   this   product   because   i   have   the   hair   serum ,   which   i   liked   also ,   and   smells   nice .   i   tried   the   shampoo   today   and   being   that   today   is   an   extremely   humid   day ,   the   product   held   up   nicely .   my   hair   had   no   tangles   and   smells   so   pretty .   i   will   purchase   this   again .   when   i   began   shampooing   i   felt   my   hair   was   not   feeling   dry   and   all   tangled   like   some   others   i   ve   tried ,   and   i   ve   tried   all   the   well   known   ones .   it   felt   soft   and   shiny .   kind   of   silky .
if   i   could   give   it   a   zero   i   would !   r5130   what   a   cheap   piece   of   junk !   you   cannot   take   the   heads   apart   to   clean ! ! ! ! !   i   guess   they   figure   everybody   will   toe   the   line   and   just   buy   new   blades .   with   norelco   i   could   easily   pop   the   blades   out   to   clean   it !   going   back   to   norelco ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
it   s   okay   this   is   okay   but   i   m   not   fond   of   the   smell .   there   is   another   bhringraj   hair   oil   on   amazon   that   smells   way   better   and   leaves   your   hair   soooo   soft .
sonic   seal   is   a   very   apt   name   for   a   product   that   defeats   the   oscillation   mechanics   of   a   sonic   toothbrush .   the   purpose   of   a   sonic   toothbrush   to   augment   the   normal   cleaning   abilities   of   bristles   by   moving   them   rapidly   and   also   to   generate   a   secondary ,   cavitation   effect ,   removing   biofilms   beyond   the   reach   of   the   actual   bristles .   these   sonic   seals   defeat   these   mechanics   of   flexcare   toothbrushes   by   filling   the   gap   that   allows   the   brush   head   to   clear   the   handle ,   dampening   the   oscillations   intended   to   be   transmitted   to   the   brush   head   and   sending   some   of   them   back   into   the   handle .   the   flexcare   line   is   too   easy   to   clean   to   necessitate   a   product   like   this .
wife   says   its   great   product   i   felt   compelled   to   write   this   review   because   my   wife   nagged   me .   she   says   its   a   really   good   bra   strap   concealer .   i   took   1   star   off   beacuse   of   the   high   price   in   my   mind ,   these   should   go   for   like   4.99   .   comes   in   pack   of   6 .   i   took   one   for   use   with   my   pc   s   cable   management .
the   best   face   cream   out   there   i   have   been   using   this   cream   for   15   years   after   it   was   first   recommended   to   me   by   a   french   dermatologist   in   paris .   i   suffer   from   eczema   and   this   was   the   only   cream   that   offered   any   relief .   not   only   does   it   soothe   but   it   feels   great   and   quite   luxurious ,   unlike   other   creams   for   oversensitive   skins   which   tend   to   be   very   thick   and   unscented .   this   is   for   sale   in   literally   every   french   pharmacy ... if   only   i   had   that   luxury   over   here ....
hellooo   i   don   t   know   if   this   can   is   expired ,   or   my   hair   is   too   thick   it   s   not   ,   or   what ,   but   this   can   did   not   do   jack !   i   sprayed   and   sprayed   from   dawn   to   dusk   and   nothing !   this   is   supposed   to   give   your   hair   volume ,   correct   not   just   sit   there   and   weigh   your   hair   down   whatever ,   back   to   the   beauty   supply   store ,   i   guess .
one   of   my   favorites !   great   scent   that   isn   t   too   sweet   but   not   too   woodsy   either !   some   are   turned   off   by   the   fact   that   it   s   made   by   the   famous   womens   bridal   designer ,   but   in   reality ,   she   knows   how   to   make   a   man   smell   amazing !   i   love   this   scent   and   have   been   wearing   it   for   three   years .   first   time   to   buy   it   from   amazon   and   the   process   was   a   breeze   with   fast   shipping .
great   deal   on   a   great   product .   this   is   my   second   time   buying   ivory   caps   i   went   wiith   the   3   bottles   deal   this   time .   i   had   taken   it   for   about   2   months   and   had   noticed   a   great   difference   not   only   in   the   reduction   of   dark   spots   and   uneven   skin   tone   but   also   in   the   smoothness   and   texture   of   my   skin .   i   appears   smoother   and   softer   especially   on   my   face .   my   skin   appears   healthier   and   a   small   scar   above   my   eye   appears   lighter   and   less   noticable .   i   take   2   3   capsules   daily   with   a   glass   of   orange   juice   for   the   vitamin   c   content .   i   find   this   works   best .   people ,   this   is   the   real   deal !   i   would   absolutely   recommend   this   product .
styler   no   more   i   have   used   this   revlon   hot   air   styler   for   years ,   but   now   they   have   changed   the   style   and   i   will   never   buy   another   one .   the   new   one   has   air   holes   above   handles   which   dry   your   hair   too   fast   and   the   brushes   are   too   soft   and   do   not   grip   the   hair .   i   am   totally   disappointed   and   saddened   i   cannot   purchase   the   old   style   and   will   not   use   revlon   stylers   anymore .
best   shave   ever ! !   this   is   a   marvelous   shave ! !   nothing   else   that   i   have   ever   used   is   anywhere   near   as   comfortable !   use   it   with   a   gel   lather   and   you   will   never   ever   again   feel   the   discomfort   of   razor   burn   no   matter   how   hard   you   work ,   or   workout ,   and   prespire ... ever ! ! !
fabulous   polish !   i   love   love   love   this   color .   br   when   i   put   it   on   it   s   like   christmas   on   my   fingers .   it   s   a   dark   red   with   red   very   thin   glitter ,   a   perfect   match   to   dorothy   s   shoes !   br   application   was   great ,   you   only   need   two   coats .   i   was   nicely   surprised   by   the   wear   and   tear ,   after   5   days   i   hardly   had   any   tear .   br   it   really   is   a   fabulous   color   than   you   can   wear   on   your   hands   or   toes ,   summer   or   winter   and   that   i   think   is   safe   for   work .   it   s   sophisticated   with   a   little   surprise .   br   i   highly   recommend !
works   good .   i   am   really   fair   skinned   and   this   the   only   stuff   that   does   not   make   my   legs   turn   orange .   i   find   it   only   lasts   a   few   days   for   me   though ,   because   i   shower   twice   a   day .   at   least   it   helps   me   to   keep   from   blinding   people   on   the   beach   with   my   whiteness ....
good   product   with   this   product   i   definitely   see   an   improvement   in   my   hair .   it   s   shinier   and   not   frizzy   with   the   horrible   humidity ! !
great   product !   delivery   is   fast !   i   received   the   item   in   excellent   brand   new   condition .   this   flat   iron   does   what   it   says   and   even   more .   it   cuts   half   the   time   of   straigthening   my   daughters   hair .   leaves   it   very   shiny   and   natural   looking   without   the   hassle .   it   heats   up   very   fast   and   the   temperature   is   adjustable   to   fit   anyone   s   type   of   hair .   i   love   it ! ! !
great   soap .   i   discovered   this   wonderful   mint   leaf   soap   at   the   home   of   a   friend ,   and   was   very   happy   to   find   it   available   at   amazon .   great   value   and   i   will   buy   it   again .
works   well !   the   dryer   works   well .   the   attachments   stay   on   very   secure   and   the   dryer   is   very   light   weight .   the   only   issue   is   that   the   dryer   setting   button   easily   slides   into   other   setting   while   holding   it .
good   hold   and   doesn   t   make   your   hair   crunchy .   i   love   this   stuff   because   it   has   great   hold   and   does   not   make   your   hair   hard .   it   sort   of   just   holds   it   in   place ,   but   doesn   t   cause   that   cruddy   crunchy   gel   effect .
best   smelling   soap !   i   bought   this   for   my   mom   who   had   been   looking   for   shalimar   bar   soap   for   ever !   glad   i   found   it   online .   it   is   so   scrumptious   smelling !
seller   substituted   other   items   that   looked   the   same   this   item   was   no   longer   available   in   stores ,   so   i   ordered   enough   to   last   a   year   from   amazon   seller   abc   wholesale   because   i   liked   the   product   so   much .   they   packaged   the   items   in   sets   of   three   in   plastic   shrinkwrap .   they   substituted   a   different   style   volume   blast   ,   which   is   in   the   exact   same   can   except   for   the   name .   i   did   not   notice   the   substitution   until   i   opened   the   last   2   shrink   wraps .   all   six   were   the   substituted   item ,   not   the   max   volume   item   that   i   had   ordered .   now   i   m   stuck   with   6   cans   of   hair   spray   that   are   a   very   different   item   and   performance   from   what   i   had   originally   ordered .
still   my   favorite   hand   cream   i   ve   been   using   this   hand   cream   for   years   and   i   ve   tried   others ,   but   this   is   still   my   favorite .   the   bottle   is   a   convenient   size   i   keep   one   in   my   desk   at   work ,   one   in   my   purse ,   etc .   the   lotion   itself   does   wonders   on   my   hands   and   is   not   greasy   at   all   rather ,   it   s   thick   and   absorbs   relatively   quickly .   additionally ,   i   m   sensitive   to   products   with   added   scents ,   so   i   love   that   it   really   is   fragrance   free .
no   ragged   edges !   finally ,   a   nail   file   that   does   the   job   the   first   time !   i   had   tried   cheaper   glass   nail   files   revlon   and   the   abrasive   surface   wore   off   and   it   no   longer   worked .   the   opi   file   works   great   and   has   lasted .   i   just   reordered   more   as   gifts .   try   it .
mirror   is   reall   small   for   the   price   but   is   actually   fogless   i   just   got   the   mirror   today ,   opened   the   box   and   to   my   surprise   was   a   tiny   little   mirror .   no   where   on   amazon   did   it   say   the   mirror   was   actually   only   6in   x   5in ,   especially   given   the   price .   however   the   mirror   does   what   it   says   and   is   fogless   which   is   nice .   the   first   time   i   used   it   i   put   water   in   the   back   and   put   it   on   the   suction   cups   and   within   a   minute   it   fell   onto   my   toe .   so   i   tried   cleaning   the   area   behind   the   suction   cups   with   some   soap   and   that   helped   and   it   didn   t   fall   the   second   time .   given   the   price   i   would   expect   the   mirror   to   be   larger ,   but   on   the   positive   it   is   actually   fogless .
does   the   job ,   but   very   very   painful !   i   purchased   this   product   hoping   for   something   that   would   eliminate   my   hair   problem   or   at   least   help   keep   it   under   control .   this   product   does   exactly   what   it   says   it   will   do   and   works   well .   very   durable ,   you   don   t   have   to   worry   about   breaking   because   it   is   indeed   a   spring .   but   wow ,   does   it   ever   hurt .   i   just   can   not   put   myself   through   that   pain   on   a   daily   basis   and   if   you   don   t   do   it   just   correctly   it   increases   the   pain   by   1000   times .   this   method   of   hair   removal   is   much   worse   than   waxing .   if   i   had   thicker ,   tougher   skin   that   wasn   t   so   sensitive   i   would   love   this   product   but   it   is   just   too   much   pain   for   me   to   handle !
wonderful   item   i   have   been   using   this   floss   for   the   past   3   years .   i   ve   never   thought   of   switching   to   a   different   type   of   floss   ever   since .
love   it   i   purchased   this   a   few   months   ago   and   love   it !   i   can   t   claim   that   it   drastically   cut   down   my   drying   time   i   towel   dried   pretty   thoroughly   in   the   past   ,   but   it   s   a   great   size   and   absorbs   well .   i   can   put   my   hair   up   after   my   shower   and   it   actually   stays   put !   it   was   money   well   spent .
clairol   natural   instincts   review   my   mother   is   allergic   to   both   amonia   and   peroxide .   she   has   been   using   this   product   for   more   than   6   months   without   any   allergic   reactions   the   color   stays   in   longer   than   some   of   the   similar   products   she   previously   used .   we   have   had   problems   finding   this   product   in   stores   so   purchasing   online   is   an   excellent   option   and   saves   a   whole   bunch   of   time   in   trying   to   find   it .   the   package   was   received   before   the   estimated   time   stated   on   amazon   which   i   also   think   is   excellent .
awesome   top   coat !   this   toap   coat   saves   my   life !   every   time   i   feel   disappointed   by   a   nail   polish ,   i   put   one   coat   of   orly   glosser   and   it   s   like   a   new   polish .   it   gives   a   very   clean   and   bright   finish   to   all   kind   of   shades   and   textures .   it   makes   the   nail   very   shiny   and   smooth .   br   i   protects   from   the   wear   and   tear   as   well ,   but   i   think   there   is   better   out   there   if   this   is   the   only   reason   you   re   wanting   a   top   coat .   however   if   you   want   a   top   coat   that   brings   the   best   of   your   polish ,   this   is   it !
good   price ,   lovely   scent ...   but   don   t   get   too   attached   this   has   been   a   favorite   perfume   of   mine   for   a   long   time .   many   years .   spicy   floral   aroma ,   not   too   strong .   the   problem   is   that   oscar   de   la   renta   no   longer   makes   this   scent ,   so   essentially   we   re   buying   what   was   manufactured   years   ago .   eventually   there   will   be   no   more .   and   eventually   i   suspect   the   remaining   bottles   will   not   be   as   full   scented   as   they   once   were .   that   also   means   you   can   t   get   the   lotion   or   dusting   powder   anymore .   br   br   so   get   it   while   you   can ...   or   not ,   because   i   m   still   using   it   and   don   t   want   to   run   out !
looks   very   natural ,   but   time   consuming   make   sure   you   have   a   lot   of   time   before   you   apply .   be   sure   to   exfoliate ,   apply   lotion   to   dry   areas ,   and   wear   gloves .   only   apply   a   small   amount   at   a   time ,   so   you   don   t   end   up   with   streaks .   if   you   take   your   time   do   it   right ,   you   will   love   the   natural   tan   results !
great   investment !   easy   to   use ,   transport   and   fast !   great   buy   a   must   now   for   my   bathroom !
favorite   body   cream   i   have   beenn   using   the   samsara   cologne   and   body   cream   for   years !   amazon   had   it   at   a   really   great   price   and   i   was   glad   i   could   find   it   here .   i   love   this   fragrance   in   the   winter   months   and   the   fall .   it   s   not   heavy   at   all .   it   had   a   woodsy   fragrance   and   reminds   me   of   winter .   i   love   it !
great   price ,   decent   look   i   like   this   product   for   everyday   use .   it   wears   well   and   does   show   results .   i   wasnt   blown   away   by   the   volume ,   and   i   would   have   liked   this   in   waterproof ,   but   al   in   all ,   for   the   price   it   was   great .
wonderful   scent   a   mite   spicy ,   a   little   woodsy ,   a   bit   floral ,   a   touch   exotic ,   a   hint   of   warm ....   basically   perfect .   seems   like   every   time   i   leave   the   house   with   this   scent   on ,   someone   moves   in   closer ,   inhales   and   then   asks   me   what   i   m   wearing ....   and   i   m   middle   aged   and   chubby ,   so   it   s   not   a   move ...   it   s   just   the   scent .   can   be   over   powering   if   over   done ,   but   with   a   light   hand   this   one   is   just   right .
good   good   product .   strange   delivery   in   that   it   is   shipped   in   more   than   one   box .
smaller   than   you   think   this   pill   box   does   not   hold   50   pills .   given   that   vitamins   and   supplements   are   of   various   sizes ,   this   container   will   not   hold   more   than   10   total .
good   but   can   t   take   the   scent   i   feel   bad   not   giving   this   a   great   review .   i   love   how   safe   it   is   and   it   seems   to   work   well .   it   s   also   not   that   expensive   as   far   as   mineral   sunscreens   go .   i   just   hate   the   scent   though .   i   put   it   on   my   son ,   but   use   a   different   brand   for   myself .   i   m   probably   a   bit   more   sensitive   to   scents   than   most ,   but   i   m   happier   with   california   baby ,   other   than   the   price .   i   haven   t   tried   the   unscented   badger   though ,   and   probably   should .
worst   conditioner   ever !   this   conditioner   did   soooo   not   live   to   my   expectations !   fist   of   all   it   is   not   tick   enough ,   it   falls   flat   like   pancake   batter   on   your   hand .   second   you   need   a   ton   before   you   can   start   distributing   it   effectively   on   your   hair .   third   i   ve   already   used   it   three   times   and   i   really   don   t   see   any   reduction   in   brassiness .   i   really   don   t   understand   why   this   conditioner   is   so   expensive   and   most   of   all   i   don   t   understand   how   some   people   can   give   it   good   reviews !
smells   like   heaven   i   love   the   smell   of   this   and   it   lathers   up   perfectly .   unfortunately   i   was   allergic   to   it .   if   not   for   that   i   would   use   it   forever .
no   more   burning   i   got   a   bottle   of   this   as   i   was   desparate   to   find   something   that   could   keep   my   nose   from   burning   when   i   am   out   on   the   water   for   long   periods   boating   jetskiing .   i   just   used   this   product   for   9   days   straight   with   several   hours   up   to   10   hrs   each   day   in   direct   sun .   my   nose   did   not   burn !   unfortunately ,   it   is   not   legal   to   sell   in   the   united   states .   i   hope   to   find   a   means   to   buy   it   on   line .   the   only   issue   i   have   with   this   product   it   that   if   used   on   legs   or   parts   that   come   in   contact   with   the   jetski   seat ,   it   will   cause   the   vinyl   seat   to   fade   in   color   at   the   point   of   contact .   so   now   i   just   use   it   for   my   face   or   parts   that   are   very   susceptible   to   burning .   great   stuff !
awesome   i   am   very   picky   when   it   comes   to   my   blow   dryers .   i   can   t   commit .   my   sister   had   purchased   this   item   at   target   and   i   loved   it !   it   has   great   power   for   it   not   being   a   professional   hair   dryer .   i   searched   for   it   at   3   targets   and   found   out   they   no   longer   carried   it .   i   was   browsing   on   amazon   and   found   it !   i   ordered   it   immediately .   i   am   very   happy   i   purchased   this   item .
didn   t   do   anything   for   my   hair   it   didn   t   do   much   for   my   hair .   it   just   feels   cool   on   the   scalp   if   you   have   braids .   i   wouldn   t   purchase   it   again .
i   love   this   makeup .   this   is   the   best   makeup   i   have   ever   used .   it   gives   a   lovely   matte   finish ,   and   you   don   t   need   to   use   a   lot .   doesn   t   promote   breakouts ,   and   is   also   a   sunscreen .   it   s   great .
wonderful ,   refreshing ,   excellent ,   must   try ! ! ! ! ! !   i   must   say ,   i   was   at   the   beginning   skeptical   of   trying   this   soap .   i   went   to   the   beauty   supply   and   right   before   my   eyes ,   i   saw   dudu   osun ! ! ! !   i   decided   to   try   it   out   because   of   the   great   reviews .   i   spent   4.99   1   bar   ,   and   can   say   honestly   that   every   penny   was   worth   wild .   this   makes   my   skin   feel   soooo   refreshed , soft   and   clean .   dudu   osun   has   an   earthy   smell ,   and   is   pleasant   to   my   sences ! ! ! ! ! !   my   skin   is   brighter ,   cleaner ,   and   my   dark   spots   has   lightened   after   2   uses .   i   will   most   definitely   purchase   more   of   this   soap   and   will   use   it   as   a   bath   soap   as   well .   just   wanted   to   add   that   i   also   purchased ,   100   pure   shea   butter   ghana   ,   and   i   love   this   as   a   moisturizer   after   using   dudu   osun ,   and   these   two   are   a   great   combination   together .   my   skin   looks   flawless ! ! ! ! ! !
very   colorful   and   bright ! ! ! !   i   got   this   in   the   mail   today . i   was   so   happy   when   i   opened   it   the   colors   are   beautiful   and   bright ! ! !   i   was   a   little   sad   that   one   of   the   eye   shadows   was   broken   and   it   was   messy   when   i   opened   it .   other   than   that   i   love   it ,   and   it   goes   on   great   and   does   not   look   chalky   or   cheap   at   all ! ! ! !   great   buy ! ! ! !
best   floss   i   ve   found   this   floss   is   the   kind   recommended   by   my   dentist   and   i   can   t   find   it   in   stores   anywhere .   target   used   to   have   it   but   not   recently .   decently   priced   online ,   and   good   service   on   delivery .
braun   shaver   great   shaver   but   all   the   shavings   fall   out   and   little   stays   in   the   shaving   head   area .
if   you   like   gloss   more   than   lipstick ,   this   is   great   for   you .   if   you   want   to   see   these   lipcolors   in   action ,   i   suggest   watching   the   first   movie   in   the   twilight   saga .   bella   swan   wore   the   color   good   to   go ,   and   the   entire   cullen   family   males   and   females   wore   the   shade   ms .   behavin   .   though   i   love   these   lipsticks ,   they   are   not   for   everyone .   the   colors   are   buildable   you   can   easily   add   more   to   any   look   ,   but   they   go   on   very   sheer .   they   are   meant   more   for   enhancing   natural   lip   color   than   for   actually   changing   their   color ,   and   touch   ups   are   necessary   after   just   an   hour   or   two .   if   you   choose   to   purchase   this   product ,   i   recommend   buying   a   lip   stick   primer   that   will   prolong   the   color   for   awhile .   as   i   said ,   they   are   very   sheer ,   so   if   you   are   looking   more   for   a   rich   lipstick   shade   than   just   a   tinted   gloss ,   i   suggested   not   throwing   away   your   18 .   you   will   be   very   unhappy .   however ,   i   love   glosses   rather   than   sticks ,   and   these   colors   have   done   wonders   for   my   extremely   pale   lips .
fabulous   for   light   blonde   lashes ! !   a   must   have !   i   have   white   blonde   eyelashes   and   eyebrows .   i   never   leave   home   without   mascara   yeah ,   okay ,   and   a   little   lipgloss ,   too .   i   m   vain   .   i   found   so   much   freedom   in   using   this   product !   i   can   now   go   to   the   water   park ,   the   pool ,   the   beach ,   etc   and   actually   have   noticeable   eyes   without   having   to   bother   with   waterproof   mascara   that   destroys   your   lashes   anyway   .   it   was   easy   fast   to   use   start   to   finish ,   including   clean   up ,   it   took   maybe   10   minutes .   if   it   s   messy   for   you ,   you   re   using   too   much   of   the   gel   at   one   time .   the   trick   is   to   make   sure   you   use   the   1st   chemical   several   times   and   allow   it   to   soak   through   the   hair   s   cuticle .   once   that   s   done ,   it   s   just   a   matter   of   barely   touching   your   lashes   with   the   colorant   gel   and   presto !   dark   lashes !   ladies ,   it   only   colors   your   existing   lashes ,   it   doesn   t   make   them   longer   or   thicker .   if   you   take   your   time   and   apply   it   carefully ,   you   can   get   it   to   go   from   the   base   to   the   tips   of   your   lashes .   i   colored   my   lashes   about   3   weeks   ago ,   and   it   s   still   going   strong .   i   ll   probably   do   a   touch   up   in   another   week   or   so .   i   m   very   happy   with   this   product .   i   wish   i   d   found   it   20   years   ago .   i   can   t   imagine   not   having   this   in   my   beauty   arsenal .   now   that   i   ve   discovered   it ,   i   ll   never   be   without   it   again .
a   peel   one   can   use   weekly   for   maintenance ...   i   purchased   this   peel   because   i   wanted   something   that   might   help   to   fade   any   small   freckles   sun   spots   developing   on   my   face ,   as   well   as   fade   small   wrinkles   near   my   eyes .   i   am   asian ,   with   a   medium   light   complexion   that   is   already   fairly   wrinkle   and   acne   free   but   i   was   starting   to   see   more   melanin   spots   on   my   face   developing ,   as   i   didn   t   start   using   sunscreen   on   my   face   daily   until   age   30   i   am   now   35   .   however ,   my   skin   does   tend   to   be   oily   in   the   t   zone ,   and   i   would   still   get   an   occasional   pimple   on   my   forehead   or   under   my   cheekbones   on   a   regular   basis .   after   using   this   product ,   i   noticed   that   my   already   scarce   breakouts   became   practically   non   existent ,   and   though   some   of   the   small   freckles   on   my   upper   cheeks   haven   t   faded   much ,   my   skin   does   feel   and   look   smoother   and   clearer .   i   don   t   use   concealer ,   powder ,   or   foundation   i   can   t   stand   the   look   and   feel   of   it   on   my   skin   ,   and   only   use   shiseido   spf   55   for   the   face   on   a   daily   basis ,   but   this   seems   to   be   all   i   need   to   still   look   pretty   flawless ,   which   i   attribute   to   some   of   the   peel   s   effects .   i   originally   only   used   the   35   glycolic   acid   peel   sold   by   the   same   company ,   but   decided   to   try   this   lactic   acid   glycolic   acid   combination   to   see   if   it   would   have   a   different   or   stronger   effect   it   does   sting   tingle   more   than   the   35   glycolic   acid   peel   alone   .   i   usually   use   this   product   every   7   days ,   and   leave   the   solution   on   for   a   full   10   minutes   it   stings   and   tingles ,   but   this   doesn   t   bother   me   much   leaving   it   on   this   long   doesn   t   cause   any   hot   spots   on   my   skin ,   either ,   but   my   skin   is   pretty   resistant   to   a   lot   of   environmental   insults   .   i   also   notice   that   small   blackheads   and   sebaceous   plugs   in   my   forehead   and   nose   will   loosen   easily   and   can   be   pushed   or   exfoliated   out   more   easily   after   using   this   peel .   overall ,   i   think   this   is   a   good   maintenance   peel   for   those   who   want   to   slow   or   possibly   even   reverse   the   subtle   signs   of   aging ,   i . e .   development   of   melanin   pigmentation   from   sun   exposure ,   smoothing   the   surface   of   the   epidermis ,   possibly   neutralizing   fine   lines ,   and   decreasing   acne .   i   will   likely   continue   using   this   product ,   until   i   become   adventurous   enough   to   perhaps   try   something   different   and   stronger   i . e .   a   70   lactic   acid   peel   .   the   price   is   right ,   too ,   and   won   t   cost   you   the   overhead   you   might   pay   for   having   the   same   type   of   peel   done   at   a   medi   spa .
minimal   results   i   used   this   product   for   little   over   six   months   with   less   than   stellar   results .   i   am   in   my   early   20s   and   have   had   lines   around   my   eyes   since   i   was   12   due   to   the   way   i   smile .   even   after   nightly   use   for   over   six   months ,   the   lines   around   the   corners   of   my   eyes   that   will   one   day   be   crows   feet   are   still   very   visible   and   i   have   seen   no   reduction   what   so   ever .   i   did   have   fain   dark   circles   under   my   eyes   that   have   faded   slightly   with   the   use   of   the   product .   to   some   up ,   i   was   expecting   a   lot   more   based   on   the   price   and   the   supposed   research   and   engineering   that   went   into   development .   i   will   up   and   date   as   i   still   have   some   left ,   but   don   t   waste   your   money   this   isn   t   a   miracle   formula .
the   best   perfume   ever ! !   when   i   wear   this   perfume ,   which   i   have   been   wearing   for   the   last   10   years ,   everyone ,   i   mean   everyone , from   the   lady   at   the   convience   store   to   the   check   in   clerk   at   the   airport   asks   me   what   i   m   wearing   and   tells   me   how   fabulous   i   smell .   this   perfume   is   so   unique   because   it   is   not   mass   marketed   still   to   this   day !   my   bottle   has   been   held   by   the   creator   while   she   poured   my   perfume   into   it !   that   is   unique   and   special   right   there ! !   love   this   perfume ! ! !
too   heavy   i   had   to   work   too   hard   to   have   this   absorb   and   i   don   t   think   ou   should   have   to   do   that   with   an   eye   cream .   another   cream   for   my   hands   until   its   done
great   for   detangling   i   love   this   conditioner .   it   lasts   long   and   its   a   great   detangler   for   african   american   hair .   i   detangle   my   hair   while   the   conditioner   is   in   it   and   it   and   it   stays   that   way   once   i   wash   it   out !
dentist   recommended   this   to   me   i   bought   2   for   my   house   my   dentist   recommended   this   system   over   all   others ,   and   i   can   see   why   after   using   it .   it   feels   like   you   just   had   your   teeth   cleaned   every   time   you   brush !   up   until   amazon   started   carrying   the   product   you   had   no   option   but   to   buy   it   at   the   dentist   office   with   their   marked   up   price .   now ,   with   the   price   cut   in   half ,   i   could   afford   2   of   these   for   everyone   in   the   house .   br   br   the   sterilization   chamber   holds   2   brusheads   of   either   size   and   angles   them   towards   a   sanitation   uv   lamp   254   nm   the   cycle   runs   15   minutes   which   is   sufficient   to   kill   anything   on   the   bristles   after   use .   i   ve   had   my   brushes   over   a   year   now   and   still   am   using   the   origianl   lamp .   you   get   two   indications   that   it   is   working ,   a   flashing   led   above   which   goes   steady   once   the   process   is   finished   and   the   chamber   has   not   been   opened   then   it   goes   out   plus   the   philips   logo   lights   up   from   the   uv   inside   but   blocks   the   harmful   rays   from   escaping   by   flourescing   in   the   uv   glow   of   the   lamp .   br   br   this   is   a   good   system   for   children ,   as   it   has   reminder   buzzes   on   when   to   move   on   to   the   next   set   of   teeth ,   and   has   5   different   cycles   from   gentile   to   vigorous .   my   dentist   recommended   it   to   me ,   and   i   recommend   it   to   anyone   who   doesnt   t   want   to   see   their   dentist   as   often !   br   br   positives   it   charges   using   an   induction   charger   meaning   there   are   no   exposed   wires .   a   coil   hides   behind   the   charging   station   and   a   second   coil   is   inside   the   toothbrush .   when   they   are   in   close   proximity   2   they   couple   energy   from   the   ac   line   to   the   brush   under   charge .   this   is   a   safe   method   of   charging   and   does   not   require   cords   to   plug   into   the   brush .   br   br   negatives   the   system   has   one   li   ion   battery .   once   it   expires ,   philips   provides   a   mechanism   to   use   a   screwdriver   to   remove   the   battery   before   throwing   away   the   toothbrush ,   thus   guaranteeing   you   will   buy   another   one .   it   would   have   been   as   easy   to   put   a   cap   on   the   bottom   allowing   you   to   replace   the   expired   battery   at   that   time   and   then   continue   to   use   the   brush   electronics ,   which   are   very   robust .   br   br   of   all   power   toothbrushes ,   this   is   the   most   efficient   and   professional .   it   s   like   comparing   the   new   front   load   washing   machines   to   yesteryear   s   top   load   models   in   efficiency   and   economics . t .   of   all   power   toothbrushes ,   this   is   the   most   efficient   and   professional .   it   s   like   comparing   the   new   front   load   washing   machines   to   yesteryear   s   top   load   models   in   efficiency   and   economics .
jerdon   wall   mount   hair   dryer   very   pleased   with   the   product   and   with   amazon   s   system .   found   the   dryer   we   wanted ,   paid   a   reasonable   price   ,   and   received   it   quickly .   attached   it   to   the   wall   easily   and   found   it   to   work   exactly   as   we   wanted .
liking   this   dryer !   soft   heat   and   light   weight !   purchased   this   item   because   i   m   needing   to   transition   from   no   lye   relaxed   4b   or   4c   hair   to   natural   hair .   as   stated ,   by   many   hair   professionals   of   african   american   hair   studies ,   that   grade   4b   or   4c   hair   is   prone   to   dryness   and   needs   plenty   of   moisture .   so ,   i   was   looking   to   wash   my   hair   then   press   it ,   but   my   hair   takes   hours   to   air   dry   though ,   it   appears   dried   once   i   towel   dry   it ...   it   still   retains   water .   dampness   effects   my   press   iron ,   if   my   shafts   are   not   free   from   vapor   therally .   well ,   i   will   be   using   and   have   used   this   dryer   to   quick   dry   my   hair   and   afterwards   press   it .   both   heat   tools   that   i   have   now   are   of   tourmaline   and   ceramic   technology ... i   believe   this   system   is   better   because   they   will   ensure   least   harsh   heat   on   my   hair   shafts .   glad   that   it   adds   shine   to   my   hair   and   i   look   forward   to   continuous   usage   in   the   future .   yes ,   it   s   light   weight   and   it   s   filter   is   easy   to   change .   br   br   i   give   it   4   stars   so   far   and   leave   off   one   because   it   s   loud   when   set   on   high ,   but   it   s   not   bothersome   as   with   all   dryers   .
wish   it   had   a   cold   air   setting   pros   lightweight ,   takes   up   very   little   space   and   comes   with   a   stylish   silver   storage   bag   great   for   travel   and   sturdy   enough   for   every   day   use   can   be   used   in   other   countries   with   prong   type   adapter   the   tourmaline   technology   which   is   supposed   to   be   less   damaging   for   your   hair   its   little   and   so   cute !   makes   adorable   gifts   cons   it   does   dry   my   rather   thick   hair   pretty   decently   and   gives   a   bit   of   body   but   don   t   expect   salon   type   effects   with   this   one   it   doesn   t   have   the   cold   air   setting
poorly   made   dryer   i   just   got   this   dryer   last   week .   you   can   get   burnt   with   this   dryer   as   the   heating   vents   are   placed   in   odd   areas   on   the   bonnet .   also   the   attachment   on   the   bonnet   the   one   you   hook   the   dryer   tube   into   came   out   completely   only   a   few   days   after   i   got   it .   so   i   am   unable   to   use .   i   will   not   purchase   again .   i   did   not   purchase   from   amazon . com   but   thought   the   review   would   be   useful .
what   a   disappointment   i   reluctantly   purchased   this   hairdryer   after   reading   all   the   reviews .   i   didn   t   really   want   to   spend   that   much   money   when   there   where   hairdryers   for   significantly   less .   the   good   things   quiet   and   not   too   heavy .   the   bad   the   heat   from   the   hairdryer   is   too   hot .   i   ve   been   blow   drying   my   hair   for   years   and   have   never   had   to   stop   because   my   scalp   felt   like   it   was   burning .   and ,   despite   the   technology   it   doesn   t   appear   to   dry   my   hair   any   faster   than   the   old   dryer   i   replaced .   one   thing   i   noticed   about   the   reviews   of   the   dryer   was   that   many   people   who   purchase   and   love   this   have   long   hair .   i   do   not   so   i   m   always   drying   right   around   my   scalp .   maybe   if   you   have   long   hair ,   this   might   be   good   for   you   but   other   than   the   quietness ,   i   don   t   see   how   this   is   worth   spending   so   much   money   on .
good   hair   dryer   i   came   from   other   contry .   our   contry   use   only   220   voltage .   when   i   come   back   to   my   contry ,   i   want   to   use   this   hair   dryer .   and   when   i   travel   abroad ,   this   will   be   very   helpful .   good   product ! !   buy   it !
can   t   beat   it   for   the   price   i   bought   this   hairdryer   because   the   one   i   had   died .   it   was   basically   the   exact   same   dryer   in   a   different   color ,   and   it   lasted   5   years .   i   believe   mine   died   because   of   a   short   in   the   cable ,   so   i   am   choosing   not   to   hang   this   one   by   the   opening   at   the   end   of   the   base ,   even   though   it   looks   like   it   should   be   hung   that   way .   this   drier   is   the   cheapest   ceramic   ionic   drier   i   have   found ,   and   it   truly   works   fast .   i   can   dry   my   thick ,   curly   though   short   hair   in   5   10   minutes ,   and   it   does   not   get   frizzy .   i   only   use   the   warm   setting   hot   is   too   hot   for   me ,   and   i   appreciate   the   cool   burst   though   i   wish   it   had   a   cool   setting .   it   also   is   a   standard   size ,   so   can   take   a   diffuser   without   a   problem   i   use   it   this   way   every   day .   i   couldn   t   live   without   this   dryer   it   dries   my   hair   so   fast   without   any   damage .   also ,   i   do   not   find   it   too   heavy .
super   hairdryer   i   know   this   is   expensive ,   but   i   feel   it   is   worth   the   money .   i   had   a   t3   for   8   years   and   found   it   to   be   superior   to   other   hairdryers .   when   it   finally   gave   out ,   i   once   again   checked   reports   and   t3   came   out   on   top .   so   now   i   am   enjoying   my   second   one .   whenever   house   guests   borrow   it ,   they   comment   on   how   wonderful   it   is .   it   really   does   dry   my   hair   faster   than   other   dryers .   i   have   small   hands   and   found   it   to   be   lighter   and   easier   to   handle .   my   only   concern   is   that   the   company   does   not   guarantee   it   if   you   buy   it   from   amazon .   however ,   i   read   that   amazon   will   stand   behind   it .   i   never   had   problems   with   my   last   one   which   worked   for   8   years .
the   second   one   i   ve   purchased   i   was   happy   to   buy   another   elchim   dryer .   my   first   one   died   after   about   five   years   of   using   it   regularly .   i   used   my   t2000   as   a   spare   until   i   found   a   good   deal   on   a   new   elchim .   elchim   is   far   better   than   the   t2000 .   i   have   mid   to   long   blond   colored   hair   and   it   dries   my   colored   hair   quickly   and   smoothly .   my   hair   color   covers   gray   hair   which   is   wirey   and   dry .   this   dryer   gives   me   the   look   i   want   for   my   hair   long   and   smooth .   amazon   had   the   best   price   on   it .   the   price   was   comparable   to   what   my   stylist   would   have   paid   at   a   beauty   supply   store .
you   get   what   you   paid   for !   i   ve   just   purchased   this   particular   dryer   of   bespoke   labs   and   i   am   very ,   very   satisfied   with   the   results !   i   ve   decided   to   purchase   it   because   cuts   down   drying   time   tremendously .   i   had   another   ionic   dryer   and   its   nothing   compare   to   professional   t3 .   my   hair   does   feel   dry   at   all ,   no   breakage ,   no   frizz .   the   engineering   is   fantastic !   it   does   what   it   claims .   i   can   stay   this   company   creates   true   ceramic ,   true   tourmaline   composed   items .   i   have   relaxed   hair   and   i   hate   drying   it .   it   takes   up   most   of   my   time   but   not   anymore !   i   used   the   low   setting   with   a   nylon   bristle   brush   and   i   could   believe   it ,   flat   shiny   moist   hair .   and   when   used   the   my   flat   irons ,   it   straighten   very   fast   a   breeze .   users   stay   they   burn   out   quickly   but   it   produces   salon   results   each   time   over .   you   ve   already   saved   hundreds   of   dollars   compared   to   the   times   used   in   total .   i   will   be   purchasing   their   flat   irons   curling   irons .   i   am   bespoke   brand   loyal   now !   then   won   me   over !
awesome   hair   dryer   my   sister   bought   this   hair   dryer   a   few   years   ago   for   200 .   one   weekend   i   spent   with   her ,   she   let   me   use   it .   we   both   have   super   thick   hair   which   takes   time   to   dry   about   30   minutes   with   a   regular   hair   dryer   .   most   time ,   i   go   out   with   my   hair   still   wet   because   i   don   t   like   to   take   the   time   to   dry   it ,   plus   i   get   overheated .   well ,   this   dryer   worked   in   half   the   time   or   maybe   less   .   i   don   t   go   out   with   wet   hair   anymore   because   it   dries   so   quickly .   it   s   light   and   works   great ,   and   now   the   cost   is   less   than   1   2   what   my   sister   paid .   totally   worth   the   investment !
great   product   purchased   this   as   a   direct   replacement   of   the   unit   mounted   in   my   motorhome   from   factory .   this   is   a   direct   replacement   even   though   the   motorhome   is   10   years   old .   my   old   unit   works   great ,   but   latch   was   starting   to   fail   and   handset   would   fall   when   traveling ,   creating   possibilities   of   damage   to   other   parts   of   bath .   we   have   used   the   old   one   lots   and   have   been   perfectly   satisfied   so   we   expect   the   same   performance   from   this   new   unit ,   also ,   the   new   one   looks   so   much   better ,   10yr   old   hair   dryers   loose   their   looks   too .   the   company   shipped   it   fast   and   all   transactions   have   been   great ,   we   are   very   satisfied .
be   careful   i   love   this   blowdryer   the   only   problem   is ,   it   is   very   dangerous   after   a   couple   of   years   it   started   to   shoot   flames ,   and   now   it   just   blows   cold   air .   my   hair   dresser   also   has   one   of   these   blowdryers   and   while   she   was   blow   drying   a   clients   hair   the   blow   dryer   caught   fire   yes   caught   fire   so   this   blow   dryer   seems   to   have   a   defect   it   can   not   be   that   two   blow   dryers   caught   fire .   other   than   that   its   a   great   blow   dryer
had   to   return   them   i   ordered   two .   the   first   time   i   turned   it   on ,   it   tripped   the   circuit   breaker .   i   didn   t   even   try   to   plug   in   the   second   one .   it   had   features   that   i   liked   so   i   was   sorry   that   it   didn   t   work   out .
b   b   owner   handy   product   for   b   bs   and   for   those   who   get   up   in   the   middle   of   the   night   since   it   has   a   night   light .

fire   hazard   don   t   buy ! ! ! !   i   do   not   do   reviews ,   except   when   i   believe   they   are   needed .   in   this   case ,   it   is   needed !   i   used   this   dryer   for   about   the   past   1   2   years .   not   that   much   trouble   out   of   it .   it   did   overheat .   i   would   let   it   cool   off   and   begin   using   it   again .   then   last   week ,   i   was   using   it   and   sparks   came   out   of   the   thing ! ! !   yes ,   sparks !   i   couldn   t   believe   it .   i   believe   that   this   thing   should   be   recalled ,   so   i   contacted   revlon .   revlon   wanted   no   part   of   it .   they   told   me   to   contact   helen   of   troy .   i   did   that .   now ,   i   am   waiting   for   a   reply .   i   have   also   contacted   the   consumer   safety   commission .   i   am   basically   begging   for   a   recall .   please   do   not   buy   this   hair   dryer .   after   contacting   revlon ,   i   will   not   buy   anything   revlon .   i   am   david   s   wife .   the   amazon   account   is   in   his   name .  
attachment   cannot   attached ! !   the   reason   i   chose   this   one   was   because   of   the   3   attached   parts ,   they   looked   great   and   useful .   but   turned   out   those   cannot   be   attached .   all   three   always   falled   down   after   15   seconds ,   so   no   use   at   all .   this   dryer   is   a   little   heavy   but   acceptable   because   the   air   is   powerful   enough   to   make   the   hair   dry   fast .   overall ,   i   am   very   disappointed   for   the   special   features .   its   design   has   a   major   problem ,   should   make   it   just   as   the   bottle   top .   updates   2   21   11   after   7   months ,   it   is   not   hot   enough ,   just   a   little   more   than   warm .   my   old   travel   dryer   is   even   better   than   this .
nothing   special   despite   the   hype   on   this   product ,   do   not   expect   less   frizz   it   is   not   one   of   those   specifically   ionic   ones .   my   sister   who   has   used   this   product   and   some   cheap   ionic   one ,   said   that   she   had   better   results   with   other   blow   dryers .   ionic   blow   dryers   give   my   thick   hair   a   smoother ,   healthier   result ,   but   this   blow   dryer   does   no   wonders .   blow   drying   time   is   also   not   very   short   i   have   long ,   semi   thick   hair   and   it   takes   forever   to   blow   dry ...   air   dry   only   takes   slightly   more   than   double   the   blow   dry   time .   can   you   blame   me   for   not   liking   to   use   this   blow   dryer   .   i   like   the   cool   setting ,   but   other   than   that ,   nothing   cool .   i   can   t   believe   i   invested   into   this   blow   dryer !   on   the   other   hand ,   it   seems   to   be   reliable   and   may   last   a   while ....   but   all   of   my   cheaper   blow   dryers   did   last   a   while   also   in   fact ,   i   still   have   them   but   i   wanted   an   upgrade   .   i   like   the   separate   vent   cleaner .   no   more   clogged   vents !   that   feature   and   the   easy   to   use   cool   feature   make   this   product   better   than   my   previous   cheap   one .   i   feel   that   this   was   a   poor   investment .   i   have   no   idea   how   the   other   reviewers   got   great   results ,   but   my   great   results   came   with   great   products .
can   t   even   give   this   away   i   was   so   excited   to   receive   this   hair   dryer   when   it   came   in   the   mail !   well   if   you   have   fine   straight   hair   do   yourself   a   favor .   don   t   purchase   this .   my   beautiful   blond   hair   is   so   limp   from   it   that   it   has   become   a   waste   of   time   using   it .   i   tried   numerous   times   not   to   put   anything   in   it   such   as   styling   products   but   it   did   not   make   a   difference .   my   girlfriend   who   has   thick   curly   hair   whom   i   considered   just   giving   it   to   her   if   she   liked   it   said   she   didn   t   like   it   at   all !   it   s   too   late   to   return   it   which   is   definitely   my   own   fault .   i   am   looking   for   something   else   to   replace   it   with   but   i   am   a   little   hesitant   to   purchase   over   the   internet .
lightweight   and   trusty   this   hairdryer   is   the   best   i   ve   had   yet .   its   not   too   noisy ,   its   not   too   weak   or   too   strong   and   is   very   lightweight .   i   blow   dry   my   hair   with   a   brush   and   it   takes   about   15mins   and   because   its   so   light   my   arms   never   get   tired .   i   would   buy   it   again .
only   purchase   from   authorized   retailer   not   amazon ! ! !   i   did   not   purchase   my   dryer   from   amazon   however   after   2years   it   just   stopped   working .   thank   goodness   i   purchased   from   authorized   retailer   i   had   no   issues   with   the   warranty   process   received   a   replacement   dryer   from   t3   although   it   did   take   a   couple   weeks   .   this   is   a   great   dryer ,   i   am   very   happy   with   it   s   performance   the   warranty   process   i   rated   low   to   warn   amazon   shoppers   to   make   sure   when   you   purchase   this   item   the   serial   tag   is   afixed   to   the   cord   it   is   absolutely   necessary   for   a   warranty   situation .   i   purchase   tons   of   things   on   amazon   i   was   disappointed   to   hear   of   the   others   having   issues   since   amazon   is   not   an   authorized   t3   retailer .   make   sure   you   do   your   research   on   this   one   before   you   decide   where   to   purchase .   i   would   definitely   recommend   the   product   itself .
holding   a   blow   dryer   is   annoying   i   have   a   calcium   deposit   in   my   right   shoulder   and   am   right   handed .   i   really   cant   hold   my   blow   dryer   up   anymore .   i   also   am   sick   of   holding   it   while   styling   with   a   brush   with   my   other   hand ... ! !   its   a   pain ,   no   pun   intended .   i   bought   the   blo   go   and   i   cant   say   enough   as   to   how   easy   and   convenient   it   has   been   for   me .   it   took   a   few   approaches   with   getting   it   on   the   mirror   at   first .   you   have   to   really   push   forward   with   a   good   amount   of   pressure   on   the   suction   area   and   then   with   the   other   hand   press   down   the   lever .   but   once   you   get   the   knack   it   really   works .   i   have   had   it   up   on   my   mirror   for   a   year .   i   just   stand   under   it ,   turn   it   on   and   style   or   dry .   you   don   t   really   know   you   need   something   like   this   until   you   used   it   one   of   those   products   that   every   woman   should   have   or   great   gift .   i   really   do   love   it .
best   hair   dryer   ever   i   have   used   this   product   before   and   it   is   so   great   that   i   bought   it   for   gifts .   don   t   let   the   price   scare   you   off   it   is   worth   every   dollar .   your   hair   will   dry   in   half   the   time   of   other   dryers   but   most   important   it   will   not   damage   your   hair   like   most   other   dryers .   your   hair   will   stay   healthy   and   will   shine . found   the   best   price   on   amazon ,   it   was   half   the   price   i   found   elsewhere .
breaks   easily   i   bought   this   hairdryer   and   when   i   came   home   and   plugged   it   in ,   it   began   to   smoke .   i   brought   it   back   to   ulta ,   and   they   graciously   replaced   it   after   seeing   the   smoke   for   themselves .   loved   the   second   one   same   hairdryer   ,   but   it   comletely   died   within   6   months .   would   not   turn   on .   works   well ,   while   it   works .   otherwise   a   cheap   hunk   of   plastic .   i   m   not   going   back   for   round   3 !
t3   blowdryer   this   product   has   been   awesome   so   far .   it   dries   my   hair   quicker   than   regular   dryers .   love   it !
nice   features   for   a   hangup   hair   dryer   traveling   on   business   often   allowed   me   to   try   quite   a   few   hotel   hair   dryers   over   the   years .   the   features   i   like   about   the   andis   hair   dryers   i   ve   used   were   that   they   were   not   too   large   or   heavy ,   they   had   medium   heat   to   medium   high   heat ,   they   didn   t   blow   too   hard ,   and   they   were   relatively   quite .   i   ve   used   some   hair   dryers   that   almost   gave   me   wrist   strain   trying   to   hold   them ,   and   some   that   caused   your   ears   to   ring   once   your   hair   was   dry .   the   andis   hangup   models   seem   to   find   a   good   compromise   between   function   and   low   noise   levels .   i   ve   put   these   in   all   our   bathrooms   at   home ,   since   they   can   be   used   without   disturbing   others   in   the   house   even   if   they   are   sleeping .   some   different   models   of   andis   dryers   i   ve   owned   before   would   stop   working   after   about   a   year   due   to   a   diode   on   the   on   off   switch   overheating   and   failing ,   but   this   model   doesn   t   seem   to   have   that   issue .   other   nice   features   that   this   30975   hd   10l   has   are   that   there   is   no   gfi   transformer   plug   at   the   end   of   the   cord ... it   s   built   into   the   base   housing   of   the   dryer .   also ,   this   unit   comes   with   a   cord   hang   up   bracket   which   can   be   placed   on   either   side   of   the   base .   like   other   hair   dryers   the   on   off   switch   will   reset   to   the   off   position   when   it   s   placed   back   into   the   base   wall   holder .   taking   the   dryer   out   of   the   base   again   will   resume   the   flow   of   warm   air .   some   reviewers   have   complained   of   the   brightness   of   the   built   in   nightlight .   it   s   not   annoying   to   me   and   it   can   be   use   it   as   the   only   nightlight   in   the   bathroom .   if   i   could   ask   for   only   one   additional   feature ,   it   would   be   a   way   to   change   the   color   of   the   led   light .   there   are   many   led   nightlights   on   the   market   that   let   you   select   what   color   you   d   like   the   light   to   have ,   and   lock   it   to   that   color .   this   would   be   a   nice   feature   to   have   on   this   unit ,   and   might   please   those   that   think   the   light   is   too   bright .   last ,   this   unit   has   a   metal   wall   bracket   and   paper   template ,   so   it   s   actually   very   easy   to   install .   the   plastic   base   then   screws   to   the   metal   plate ,   once   mounted ,   with   two   small   screws   hidden   by   the   hair   dryer   when   it   s   in   the   base .   any   excess   cord   can   be   hidden   inside   the   base ,   so   between   not   having   an   unsightly   gfi   box   on   the   plug   end   and   the   fact   that   you   can   shorten   the   cord   to   just   a   few   inches ,   if   needed ,   makes   for   a   very   clean   installation .   no   cords   unsightly   tangled   cords   hanging   around   your   bath   to   get   caught   on   other   stuff .   and   not   having   the   gfi   plug   allows   other   appliances   like   cordless   tooth   brushes ,   shavers ,   or   rollers   to   be   used   on   the   same   wall   outlet   without   the   adjacent   plug   s   being   blocked . ted ,   with   two   small   screws   hidden   by   the   hair   dryer   when   it   s   in   the   base .   any   excess   cord   can   be   hidden   inside   the   base ,   so   between   not   having   an   unsightly   gfi   box   on   the   plug   end   and   the   fact   that   you   can   shorten   the   cord   to   just   a   few   inches ,   if   needed ,   makes   for   a   very   clean   installation .   no   cords   unsightly   tangled   cords   hanging   around   your   bath   to   get   caught   on   other   stuff .   and   not   having   the   gfi   plug   allows   other   appliances   like   cordless   tooth   brushes ,   shavers ,   or   rollers   to   be   used   on   the   same   wall   outlet   without   the   adjacent   plug   s   being   blocked .
love   my   new   hair   dryer   i   read   the   reviews   before   making   a   decision .   the   one   negative   review   was   wires   shorting   out .. but   i   know   you   shouldn   t   wrap   cord   tightly   around   the   dryer .   it   s   powerful   and   it   works !
well   worth   the   i   was   traveling   on   business   and   came   across   this   hair   dryer   at   the   hotel !   i   literally   ordered   one   from   my   hotel   room ,   immediately   after   using   the   dryer .   works   really   well !   love   the   fact   that   it   folds   up   and   has   a   retractable   cord .   great   space   saver .
only   dries   the   top   of   your   head !   i   have   had   this   dryer   a   few   years   now   and   i   rarely   use   it   due   to   its   poor   performance .   it   only   has   holes   at   the   top   of   the   hat   so   the   air   is   only   released   at   the   top   of   your   head   and   it   does   not   dry   the   back   and   lower   sides   of   your   hair   properly .   you   have   to   keep   turning   and   twisting   your   head   to   get   some   of   the   air   to   blow   on   each   quadrant   of   your   head .   the   adjustable   length   is   not   very   practical   and   you   have   to   be   creative   about   where   you   put   the   dryer   and   the   chair   you   use   in   order   to   sit   under   the   it   comfortably .   do   not   buy   this   product !
best   dryer   for   the   price   this   drier   gives   me   another   proof   that   how   amazon . com   helps   me   find   the   best   product .   simple   design ,   great   quality ,   compact   form   factor ,   for   14   you   simply   cannot   find   a   better   one .
bought   for   foreign   travel   and   love   it !   i   bought   this   to   bring   with   me   to   europe .   the   size   is   perfect   and   i   have   long   thick   hair   and   this   small   hair   dryer   dried   my   hair   pretty   quickly .   i   would   definitely   recommend !
love   at   first   blow   i   never   knew   a   blowdryer   could   be   this   wonderful .   i   should   have   invested   in   it   years   ago   and   saved   all   that   money   on   straighteners   and   fancy   products   that   i   bought   to   compensate   for   crappy   blowdryers .   now   i   know .
returning   this   i   ordered   this   dryer   specifically   for   the   diffuser   shown   in   the   picture .   instead   of   the   diffuser ,   it   came   with   a   cheap   hair   brush   that   you   could   purchase   at   a   dollar   store .  
perfect   for   me   it   does   what   it   supposed   to   do .   don   t   know   what   else   to   say   than   that .
beware   electrical   gfi   doesn   t   work !   i   have   purchased   three   of   these   hairdryers   for   my   home   and   was   very   fond   of   the   performance   until   yesterday .   one   of   the   dryers   stopped   working   completely ,   while   another   not   in   the   master   bathroom   outlet .   i   called   our   electrician   to   see   if   the   outlet   was   having   a   problem   which   it   was   not .   while   plugging   in   one   of   the   dryers ,   a   huge   flame   shot   out   of   the   gfi   plug   and   burned   completely   through   the   cord .   the   gfi   cord   did   not   work   and   there   was   luckily   some   minimal   damange   to   the   walls .   please   be   careful   and   make   sure   you   have   a   gfi   outlet   installed   in   your   home   where   you   use   this   product .   the   electrician   believed   that   the   gfi   on   the   hair   dryer   failed   and   the   cord   was   risky   for   electrical   fire .   be   careful ...
just   what   i   was   looking   for   i   was   surprised   to   see   how   fast   this   dryer   was   shipped .   i   was   looking   for   a   small   hand   held   drier   due   to   haveing   ra   in   both   wrists   i   have   a   very   hard   time   useing   a   bigger   hand   drier .   this   drier   was   the   perfect   size   for   me .
excellent   little   dryer   excellent   little   dryer ,   but   i   would   caution   you   that   the   high   setting   does   not   work   in   europe .
worked   well   for   awhile   but   a   fire   hazard   i   ve   had   this   dryer   for   a   little   over   a   year .   worked   well ,   dried   quickly   and   although   not   small   the   dryer   is   lightweight   for   its   size .   but   just   had   a   huge   scare   this   morning   while   drying   my   hair .   the   cord   literally   broke   off   from   the   base   sending   a   flare   up   of   fire   into   the   air   and   exposing   the   wires !   i   ve   had   much   cheaper   dryer   s   for   years   and   i   ve   never   experienced   anything   like   this .   major   safety   issue   and   now   i   have   a   100   dryer   thats   unusable   after   a   little   more   then   a   year .   i   have   a   message   into   amazon . com   but   i   suspect   since   its   been   a   little   over   a   year   any   warranty   that   was   offered   is   no   longer   valid .   i   ll   update   this   review   when   i   get   a   response .   as   far   as   its   use ,   it   was   used   about   5x   per   week   and   although   it   had   a   long   cord   i   used   it   right   by   the   outlet   so   it   wasn   t   stretch   or   tugged .   the   cord   did   get   twisted   up   much   easier   then   far   cheaper   dryers   and   other   appliances   and   this   may   have   contributed   to   the   problem .  
best   tourmaline   ceramic   for   the   price !   very   light   weight .   dries   my   shoulder   length   thick   hair   very   fast   almost   half   the   time   my   old   hair   dryer .   the   red   color   is   cool !   discovered   the   andis   brand   while   staying   in   a   marriott   recently   and   really   liked   that   one .   this   is   an   upgraded   version .   i   ve   read   that   some   people   think   that   it   s   loud   but   i   don   t   notice   it .   sounds   just   like   the   ones   in   the   salon   to   me !
jerdon   wall   mount   this   item   has   a   wall   mount   with   two   flimsy   plastic   tabs   that   must   fit   into   slots   as   the   unit   is   put   back   into   the   wall   mount .   these   tabs   are   so   flimsy   that   they   do   not   maintain   the   spacing   to   fit   into   both   tabs .   it   is   very   difficult   to   get   the   unit   back   into   the   mount .   ours   lasted   only   a   couple   weeks   until   one   of   the   tabs   broke   off   completely .   the   actual   unit   seems   ok   but   we   consider   the   mount   a   no   go   and   would   not   buy   this   item   again .
light   dry   this   is   a   cool   and   very   light   blow   dryer ,   its   light   and   its   light   and   its   very   light .   its   may   be   not   as   powerful   as   some   blow   dryers   but   its   pretty   strong   and   yes   its   very   light
worked   fine   but   didn   t   last   long   i   bought   this   hari   dryer   about   2.5   years   ago .   i   liked   the   fact   that   it   was   mounted   and   had   the   night   light .   it   was   never   the   most   powerful   hairdryer   but   i   generally   only   dry   my   bangs   and   just   fluff   the   water   off   the   top   of   the   curls ,   so   i   wasn   t   that   worried   about   it .   if   i   was   pulling   and   straightening   my   hair   every   day ,   this   would   not   have   been   enough   power .   that   said ,   it   worked   fine   for   what   i   needed .   however ,   today   it   started   to   spark .   this   is   not   hard   wired ,   its   just   a   plug   in   model .   i   was   pretty   surprised   because   it   gave   no   other   indication   that   it   was   wearing   out .   i   would   expect   most   hair   dryers   that   are   used   lightly   to   last   longer   than   this .   too   bad .   considering   the   higher   price   tag   for   the   wall   mounted   version   and   the   short   life   of   the   product ,   i   would   not   buy   it   again .
good   hairdryer ,   retractable   cord   could   be   better ,   only   lasted   7   months   this   hairdryer   is   relatively   quiet .   however ,   the   cord   does   not   retract   all   the   way   that   it   should .   i   have   had   other   retractable   hair   dryers   that   did   not   have   a   problem   retracting   until   i   broke   off   the   button ...   it   s   better   than   not   retracting ,   but   there   s   a   good   8   inches   left   after   its   retracted .   jan   2011   the   hairdryer   died   on   me .   most   hairdryers   will   last   a   couple   years .   this   only   lasted   7   months .
2nd   failure   this   hairdryer   quit   working   within   one   month .   it   gets   hot ,   but   the   blower   does   not   come   on   probably   a   fire   hazard .   this   is   our   second   one   of   these ,   the   first   quit   working   within   the   first   year !
yes   the   best   hair   dryer   i   ve   ever   used .   cut   my   drying   time   in   half   and   i   have   a   lot   of   hair !
great   blowout   i   love   love   love   this   blowdryer !   it   not   heavy ...   doesnt   create   alot   of   heat   to   damage   the   hair ...   im   african   american   so   its   hard   to   find   a   dryer   that   wone   fry   my   hair ...   it   leaves   it   feeling   light   and   airy .
dont   do   it !   i   am   a   professional   hairstylist .   i   cant   believe   how   crappy   this   deal   is !   ordered   my   blowdryer ,   got   it ,   knew   it   was   fake   almost   instantly   i   already   own   a   real   one   ,   wanted   to   return   it .   i   called   them   and   told   them   it   was   fake   and   they   said   i   could   return   it   for   a   refund .   they   e   mailed   a   rma   and   i   sent   it   back .   well   a   month   has   gone   by   and   they   claim   they   havent   recieved   it   and   wont   even   try   to   help   me   find   it .   yeah   right .   total   scam   because   i   called   them   out   for   being   fake .   they   wanted   to   exchange   but   i   was   adamant   on   a   refund .   i   guess   they   didnt   like   that .   losers .   dont   do   it !
hair   dryer   i   moved   and   left   my   hair   dryer   so   i   ordered   a   new   one   the   same   as   i   had   but   improved .   it   works   good , it   is   easy   to   use ,   and   looks   better   than   the   old   one .   clark
a   natural   s   must   have   i   received   the   product   on   time .   no   problems   are   noted   so   far .   i   mainly   use   it   for   deep   conditioning   and   to   speed   up   the   drying   process   of   twist   outs .   recently   i   used   the   brush   attachment   to   blow   out   my   hair .   i   used   both   high   and   low   settings .   it   worked   amazingly .   if   your   a   natural ,   you   definitely   should   own   this   product .   it   has   surely   put   some   smiles   on   my   face !
thank   you   so   much   wonderful   just   what   i   wanted   needed ...   i   read   the   other   reviews   to   make   my   decision ,   they   were   right   on , , ,   thank   you
quick   dry   this   is   the   best   hair   dryer   i   have   ever   bought .   it   has   cut   my   drying   time   in   half   and   it   is   so   much   quieter   than   any   other   dryer   i   have   ever   used .   it   was   worth   every   penny ! ! ! ! !
a   great   choice   i   have   owned   an   andis   hair   dryer   before   and   loved   it   i   had   to   leave   it   when   i   sold   my   home .   i   quickly   ordered   a   new   one   for   my   present   home   a   slightly   upgraded   version   and   am   extremely   pleased .   it   is   very   quiet   and   the   nightlight   is   very   useful   during   the   night .   i   would   highly   recommend   this   dryer .
i   love   this   hair   dryer !   a   few   years   ago ,   i   used   a   first   class   hair   dryer   that   was   provided   in   the   marriott   hotel   and   loved   it .   when   i   got   home ,   i   found   this   one   on   amazon   and   ordered   it .   i   love   this   hair   dryer !   i   use   it   all   the   time   not   just   when   traveling .   it   s   light   weight   so   my   arms   don   t   get   tired ,   and   it   blow   dries   my   short   haircut   very   quickly   about   5   mins   with   styling .   i   also   like   that   it   doesn   t   have   that   long   blower   on   it   which   is   harder   for   me   to   use   for   some   reason .   i   saw   the   review   about   it   not   working   right   in   spain ,   but   i   was   very   pleased   with   how   it   worked   in   greece .   there   is   a   screwlike   switch   you   have   to   turn   for   european   voltage   and   i   wonder   if   the   previous   reviewer   did   not   realize   this   when   the   hair   dryer   is   set   to   european   voltage ,   there   is   only   one   speed   high   ,   instead   of   the   usual   high   and   low ,   and   i   was   pleasantly   surprised   that   the   hair   dryer   worked   perfectly   in   greece ,   just   as   it   did   at   home   same   strength   and   heat .   the   only   maintenance   was   to   clean   the   filter   with   an   old   toothbrush   once   in   awhile   as   it   would   get   covered   with   lint   from   hair   products   i   use   and   then   the   dryer   would   overheat   but   this   is   something   i   have   to   do   with   any   hairdryer   i   purchase .   after   being   used   everyday   for   about   three   years ,   it   s   starting   to   sound   as   if   the   motor   is   going   and   so   i   m   back   to   buy   another   one .   my   daughter   tried   mine   and   liked   it   so   much ,   she   got   one   also .   we   both   prefer   this   hairdryer   to   many   other   more   expensive   ones   we   ve   tried   through   the   years .   i   highly   recommend   this   hairdryer !
andis   40055   hair   dryer   this   hair   dryer   is   smaller   than   i   expected   however   i   am   impressed .   the   sound   is   not   that   ear   pearcing   scream   small   hair   dryers   make .   the   air   flow   and   options   are   ideal .
small   but   still   good   its   a   small   blow   dryer   but   it   does   the   job   great   like   a   bigger   blow   dryer   would . in   this   case   size   does   not   matter   because   it   does   the   job .
andis   30970   hangup   1600w   hair   dryer   w   cord   very   cheap !   not   much   blowing   power   and   very   little   heat .   i   can   not   recommend   this   product .   i   forgot   to   mention   it   is   also   very   noisy !   spend   a   little   more   money   and   get   you   a   good   one .   david   ohio
found   this   at   hotel   in   napa ,   ca   i   have   been   looking   for   a   small ,   low   voltage ,   hair   dryer   for   some   time .   went   to   napa   with   some   friends ,   and   this   hair   dryer   was   in   the   hotel .   i   used   it ,   loved   it ,   wrote   down   the   name   and   found   it   at   amazon . com .   ordered   it   and   it   came   within   days .   i   have   thin   hair ,   and   this   is   best   for   me .
wall   mount   hair   dryer   great   product !   love   it !   it   is   great   to   have   this   just   like   the   hotels !   a   very   nice   perk   at   a   very   reasonable   price !   extremely   convenient !   no   longer   do   i   need   to   leave   the   house   with   my   wet   hair   because   it   is   somewhat   inconvenient   to   reach   my   husband   s   plug   in   for   the   hair   dryer ... usually ,   i   would   just   say   forget   about   it   !   love   the   product !
very   handy   and   neat   this   hair   dryer   is   quiet   and   does   a   good   job .   we   bought   it   because   we   liked   the   ones   at   motels   and   timeshares   we   had   seen   and   wanted   one   like   them .   the   night   light   is   quite   bright   almost   too   bright   for   us   .   the   air   flow   is   quiet   and   does   a   good   job   but   does   not   offer   separate   heat   air   controls .   overall   we   are   pleased   with   it .
do   not   purchase !   do   not   buy   this   product   from   this   merchant !   i   ordered   this   blow   dryer   3   months   ago   and   it   has   already   broken .   the   merchant   will   not   replace   it   and   neither   will   amazon   because   it   is   past   the   30   day   warranty .   amazon   first   told   me   they   would   replace   it ,   but   then   changed   their   mind .   i   believe   that   when   you   pay   over   100   for   a   product   that   breaks   only   a   couple   months   later ,   it   should   be   replaced .   i   suspect   this   product   was   used   and   refurbished .   my   advice   would   be   to   buy   from   a   salon   or   beauty   supply   store   because   then   you   can   register   it   with   the   manufacturer ,   which   you   cannot   if   you   buy   it   through   amazon .   i   am   very   disappointed   with   this   product   and   the   service   i   received   from   the   seller   and   would   discourage   anyone   from   falling   into   the   same   trap   i   did .
caught   on   fire !   this   hair   dryer   seemed   to   perform   ok   for   a   few   months ,   but   then   it   caught   on   fire .   seems   like   manufacturers   of   electrical   appliances   could   prevent   fires .   just   good   thing   my   wife   didn   t   get   burned   in   the   process .
this   hairdryer   is   a   steal !   i   shopped   around   to   compare   prices   on   this   conair   hairdryer   and   this   was   a   steal ! .   it   is   pretty   good   and   it   is   a   tourmaline   ceramic   hairdryer   with   the   standard   attachments .   there   might   be   more   efficient   more   powerful   hairdryers   out   there   but   you   will   also   pay   at   least   4   times   this   price .
after   10   months ,   hair   is   fried .   i   believed   the   wonderful   hype   about   this   dryer .   still ,   there   was   one   nagging   review   that   said   the   hair   dryer   was   breaking   her   hair .   i   ignored   it .   i   hope   you   won   t .   the   dryer   seemed   to   make   my   hair   dull .   i   could   live   with   that .   but   i   started   to   watch   my   hair   get   frizzy .   i   have   wavy   hair ,   and   i   live   in   a   dry   climate   no   reason   for   frizz .   but   it   wasn   t   actually   frizzy   it   was   actually   all   the   broken   ends   frying   into   frizzle .   i   finally   had   to   admit   that   the   dryer   was   the   problem   and   i   went   back   to   my   nearly   broken   old   dryer   from   1995 .   it   will   take   a   long   time   before   my   hair   is   grown   out   and   the   damage   gone .   lots   of   nourishing   hair   products   and   lots   of   time .   and   i   wasted   so   much   money   on   a   dryer   that   really   hurt   my   hair .   too   late   for   me ,   but   if   you   haven   t   bought   it   yet ,   don   t   do   it .
conair   hair   dryer   the   hair   dryer   is   efficient   and   easy   to   use .   it   has   enough   power   to   dry   one   s   hair   in   a   very   short   time   without   being   too   hot   to   bear .
awesome   dryer   i   have   always   bought   conair   dryers .   the   one   i   was   currently   using   was   12yrs   old   and   finally   bit   the   dust !   so   i   decided   to   buy   the   silverbird .   wow ,   my   hair   is   below   the   middle   of   my   back   and   usually   took   20   minutes   to   dry .   with   the   silverbird ,   it   took   7   and   my   chemically   treated   hair   was   so   shiny   and   smooth   i   can   t   quit   touching   it   haha .   definitely   worth   it ,   and   to   think   i   almost   dropped   100   on   a   solano .
excellent   product   and   a   great   bargain   bought   this   for   my   wife   for   christmas   and   she   has   been   using   it   on   daily   basis .   i   am   glad   that   she   loves   it .
amazing   dryer !   quick   quiet !   when   my   old   remington   dryer   that   is   7   years   old   broke   i   started   looking   for   a   replacement ,   needless   to   say   i   ended   up   returning   4   dryers   before   i   found   this   one .   i   loved   my   old   dryer   because   it   was   so   quiet ,   i   can   t   stand   the   dryers   that   have   a   high   pitched   whining   noise .   so   i   called   remington   they   told   me   this   was   the   quietest   dryer   they   make   they   measure   by   decibels   this   dryer   had   the   lowest   .   so   i   bought   it   it   is   super   quiet ,   the   motor   doesn   t   really   give   off   any   noise   the   only   sound   you   hear   is   the   airflow .   and   the   airflow   on   this   dryer   is   super   strong ,   its   much   stronger   than   my   last   dryer   so   it   does   dry   your   hair   pretty   quick .   i   am   very   pleased   with   this   product .   it   comes   with   a   4   year   warranty   too .   the   hot   setting   is   hot   but   its   nice   because   it   doesn   t   get   hot   enough   wear   it   feels   like   its   burning   your   scalp .   i   actually   bought   mine   at   walmart   online   for   27 ,   it   was   such   a   great   deal !   i   highly   recommend   this   dryer ,   its   great .
real   time   saver   my   daughter   recently   bought   this   hair   dryer   and   let   me   dry   my   hair   with   it .   it   dryed   my   thick   shoulder   length   hair   in   a   little   over   5   minutes .   i   love   it .   my   hair   has   a   little   wave   in   it ,   in   the   wrong   places ,   and   this   straightens   that   out   if   i   use   a   wide   round   brush   with   it .   it   does   get   rid   of   the   small   amount   of   frizz   i   have .   my   daughter   has   long ,   frizzy ,   thick   hair   and   she   found   this   dryer   to   dry   quickley   and   smooth   down   her   hair .
meh   i   bought   this   dryer   after   getting   sick   of   having   to   share   my   old   one   with   5   other   family   members .   it   s   neither   great   nor   horrible .   br   it   does   what   it   is   designed   to   do   dry   hair .   that   s   about   where   the   positives   end .   the   dryer   is   very   heavy   and   it   takes   a   good   seven   minutes   or   so   to   dry   my   baby   fine ,   shoulder   length   hair .   the   buttons   on   the   dryer   are   in   an   awkward   place   and   i   m   forever   accidentally   bumping   them   and   switching   the   settings   or   accidentally   turning   it   off ,   mid   dry .   i   did   not   notice   any   difference   in   my   hair   using   this   dryer   with   its   purported   ion   technology .   the   thing   that   annoys   me   the   most   about   this   dryer   is   the   cord .   it   s   nowhere   near   long   enough   for   my   liking .   it   s   so   short   that   i   barely   have   enough   length   to   dry   my   hair   without   sitting   down   and   i   m   5   3 !   bottom   line   if   you   need   just   a   hairdryer   for   a   short   amount   of   time   and   don   t   care   that   it   s   heavy   slow   has   a   short   cord   then   this   is   the   dryer   for   you .
it   works .   been   taking   it   for   a   couple   of   months   now ,   and   it   s   most   definitely   working   for   me .
not   so   great   i   was   optimistic   after   reading   the   mostly   positive   reviews ,   however   i   was   highly   disappointed .   if   you   don   t   apply   the   product   several   times   in   heavy   coats   you   don   t   taste   anything   and   it   needs   to   be   reapplied   frequently   at   least   daily   .   also ,   while   using   the   product   it   seemed   that   the   taste   would   happen   several   seconds   after   going   to   bite   my   nails   which   made   it   rather   ineffective   as   a   control   mechanism .   and   when   eating   or   drinking   anything   if   you   just   so   happen   to   touch   or   lick   anywhere   near   your   nail   it   gives   your   food   what   seems   to   be   a   more   bitter   and   effective   bad   taste   compared   to   your   nails   themselves .   i   started   to   use   a   similar   nail   polish   product   but   did   not   like   the   shine   and   how   frequently   it   needed   to   be   applied   but   it   was   much   more   effective   and   much   cheaper   as   well .   i   suggest   the   nail   polish   over   this   product .
works   great !   i   purchased   this   for   a   rental   house   we   have ,   but   used   it   myself   when   i   installed   it .   it   works   great ,   lots   of   power ,   dried   my   hair   quickly   and   that   s   saying   something   since   my   hair   is   usually   slow   to   dry .   installed   quickly   as   well .   i   thought   the   cord   could   be   a   titch   longer   but   i   didn   t   feel   it   was   so   short   that   i   couldn   t   comfortably   stand   away   from   the   dryer   to   be   in   front   of   the   mirror .   overall ,   a   great   product   for   a   great   price .   br   br   update   it   s   now   been   9   months   since   i   purchased   and   installed   these   in   our   rental   home ,   and   they   still ,   after   heavy   usage ,   work   great .   no   signs   of   wear   and   tear   or   less   power   or   any   problems   to   report .
width   stretcher   unlike   other   stretchers ,   this   one   will   only   widen   your   shoes ,   not   make   them   longer .   this   isn   t   made   clear   in   the   description .   it   s   still   well   made   and   i   was   creative   enough   to   make   it   work ,   but   if   you   re   looking   to   stretch   a   shoe   length   wise   this   probably   isn   t   your   best   option !
decided   against   using   this   i   took   this   product   to   my   doctor   and   he   said   the   colon   cleanse   was   the   same   as   a   laxative   and   the   acai   juice   was   just   a   placebo
good   shave   i   bought   this   razor   for   my   dad   who   decided   to   switch   to   electric   shaving   at   age   97 !   it   works   really   great   for   him   shaves   beautifully   and   is   well   designed .   you   will   not   be   disappointed   with   this   shaver .
good   product ..   love   it !   i   have   frizzy   thick   hair   and   using   this   product   makes   it   more   manageable .   adds   shine   and   softness ..   not   oily   heavy ..   love   it .
poor   battery   life   the   battery   life   is   very   poor .   a   new   one   lasts   only   a   few   weeks .   we   burned   through   the   original   and   two   replacements   in   the   four   months   or   so   that   we   ve   owned   it .   there   is   only   the   two   of   us ,   so   i   doubt   it   gets   used   even   twice   a   day   on   average .
gives   you   beautiful   skin   i   have   been   using   this   product   for   over   ten   years   switched   to   others   briefly   in   that   time   but   nothing   compares   .   i   was   sold   on   it   way   back   in   the   beginning   when   i   d   been   using   it   a   few   months   and   some   women   commented   across   a   room   that   my   face   glows !   i   knew   it   was   the   healthy   skin   lotion   and   have   never   parted   ways   with   it   since .   i   am   40   now   and   honestly   get   told   a   lot   that   i   look   to   be   in   my   mid   late   20   s .   a   lot   of   that   is   staying   out   of   the   sun   and   this   lotion .   the   only   complaint   i   have   about   it   is   the   scent .   all   these   years   later   and   i   have   always   hoped   badly   that   they   would   change   it   but   they   never   have .   i   honestly   dislike   it   but   the   lotion   is   so   good   that   i   still   use   it !   amazing   product ! !
not   much   cotton   the   wooden   sticks   on   these   swabs   break   frequently .   there   is   not   much   cotton   on   the   tip .   the   6   inch   version   work   much   better .   asin   b000gulsl4   cotton   applicators   puritan   non   sterile   6   100   pkg  
great   experience ...   so   since   this   isn   t   sold   by   amazon ,   i   m   mainly   reviewing   the   seller   wish4star   .   br   br   i   received   this   order   in   a   timely   fashion   it   s   shipped   standard   usps   and   so   took   a   few   days ...   maybe   5   or   so   .   all   the   items   in   the   pic   showed   up   and   the   packaging   was   compact   and   secure .   br   br   however ,   upon   going   through   all   the   razors   great   selection   of   blades   btw   ,   i   noticed   that   one   box   had   been   opened   and   a   razor   had   been   opened !   yuck ! !   so   i   contacted   the   seller   and   he   assured   me   this   had   never   happened   before   i   have   a   feeling   he   s   telling   the   truth   and   that   he   would   send   me   a   new   box   asap .   well   i   just   received   my   replacements   yeah   he   sent   an   extra   pack !   ,   which   showed   up   quite   quickly .   br   br   so   all   in   all   i   trust   this   seller   had   a   very   positive   experience   with   him .   i   will   most   likely   be   purchasing   in   bulk   from   him   once   i   settle   on   a   single   brand   of   razor .
hair   products   this   product   was   in   good   condition   when   i   received   it .   shipping   was   nominal .   thank   you !
very   nice !   this   product   gave   me   definite   results   unlike   many   products   where   it   s   a   gradual   color .   after   one   application ,   i   look   like   i   ve   spent   a   day   at   the   beach   which   is   exactly   what   i   wanted   to   achieve .   it   s   not   greasy   or   sticky   which   is   great !   it   dries   quickly .   no   annoying   scent .   you   must   wear   gloves .   fairly   easy   to   apply   and   looks   even .   great   product !   i   m   sold !
great   item   and   service   these   pony   tail   holders   are   a   good   strong   weight   to   hold   my   heavy   hair   without   breaking   hair .   the   item   arrived   in   3   days   from   across   the   country .   it   is   just   a   described   good   quality .   this   store   is   so   great   because   they   don   t   charge   shipping   fee .   other   web   sites   charged   a   fee   equal   to   or   even   more   than   the   cost   of   the   product !   i   recommend   this   store   and   the   product .
not   greasy   i   ve   been   using   this   for   about   a   month .   not   greasy .   it   moisturizes   and   puts   a   good   dark   brown   tone   in .
always   try   amazon   1st   product   is   a   nice   beigey   gloss , cannot   find   it   in   the   stores   anymore   so   i   came   to   amazon
new   favorite   toothpaste   i   feel   so   silly   ordering   toothpaste   from   the   internet ,   but   none   of   my   local   stores   stock   this   gel   bottle   version   anymore !   our   local   pharmacy   usually   has   the   cinnamon   rush   in   a   tube ,   which   is   okay ,   but   i   really   prefer   the   texture   of   this   gel .   and   the   multi   pack   price   is   really   generous   at   least   compared   to   what   toothpaste   sells   for   individually   at   retail   .
perfect   for   hot   rollers !   i   recently   purchased   asin   b000q6v1ug   remington   h   2050   t   studio   ceramic   heated   clip   hair   rollers   with   tourmaline   and   found   that   the   heated   clips   with   these   remington   rollers   did   not   hold   the   roller   in   place ,   unless   i   stayed   really   still ,   and   that   s   not   going   to   happen   in   the   a . m .   br   the   heated   clip   that   remington   has   is   a   great   concept ,   but   the   smooth ,   heated   surface   also   makes   it   more   slippery   on   dry   hair .   so   i   ordered   these   conair   clips   because   they   said   they   were   large ,   and   could   withstand   heat .   so   now   in   addition   to   my   heated   clips ,   or   in   leiu   of ..   these   were   the   perfect   answer !   you   can   t   heat   these   clips   in   the   remington   unit ,   but   they   can   withstand   the   very   hot   velour   rollers ,   as   well   as   blow   dryer   heat .   they   also   can   hold   a   jumbo   size   roller ,   large   enough   a   roller   for   someone   like   me   with   really   long   and   crazy   curly   hair   that   needs   to   be   tamed !   no   slipping   at   all ,   and   no   crease   marks   with   rollers !
coastal   scents   88   eye   shadow   palette ,   ultra   shimmer ,   packaging   was   excellent ,   this   is   exactly   what   i   was   looking   for ,   great   for   day   time   using   light   colors   and   for   night   time   of   course   using   dark   shades .   this   is   a   great   product   with   great   price .   br   br   i   originally   wanted   to   by   bare   escentuals   eye   shadows   but   they   are   bit   expensive ,   especially   if   you   are   not   going   to   use   such   eye   shadows   that   are   needed   for   pakistani   indian   wedding   parties ,   then   do   not   buy   something   expensive   as   mac   or   bare   escentuals ,   no   doubt   mac   and   be   got   great   makeup   but   its   too   expensive .   br   br   so   i   definitely   recommend   this   makeup   because   its   good ,   stays   on   and   great   price !
excellent   i   really   like   this   flat   iron ,   no   other   iron   got   my   hair   so   straight   and   shiny .   i   particulalrly   like   the   comb   which   really   helps   to   straighten   my   ends ,   which   is   always   the   first   to   revert .   i   will   reccommend   this   iron   to   anyone   with   naturally   kinky   hair   anytime !   my   only   issue   was   that   sometimes   it   was   a   bit   difficult   to   manoeuvre   as   it   is   kinda   large .
  not   long   lasting ...   dont   buy   the   tester   ones ...   i   dont   recommend   you   to   buy   these   tester   ones .   every   tester   i   bought   doesnt   stay   on   me   long ,   maybe   half   an   hour ,   then   i   dont   even   feel   the   fragrance .   dont   waste   your   money   on   testers ...
too   powerful .   extra   features   mean   nothing .   too   powerful   on   high .   not   powerful   enough   on   other   settings .   needs   a   additional   setting .   extra   features   nano   technology ,   ion ,   etc .   do   nothing   to   change   the   look   or   health   of   my   hair .   the   diffuser   doesn   t   make   my   hair   curly   wavy .   but   the   one   on   my   old   hair   dryer   did .   going   to   try   and   return .
follow   up   review   after   almost   two   years   of   use   i   have   had   this   shaver   going   on   two   years .   the   first   one   completely   broke   down   after   a   year   and   panasonic   sent   me   a   replacement   it   was   refurbished !   i   have   had   that   one   about   8   months   and   it   is   terrible   the   place   where   it   shows   minutes   and   other   data   is   so   scrambled   that   it   is   impossible   to   read   the   shave   is   rough   and   no   longer   close .   i   just   believe   this   shaver   is   meant   to   last   no   longer   than   a   year   and   then   it   goes   bad .   by   the   way ,   this   is   an   authentic   review   i   live   in   california   and   have   been   a   member   here   for   years .
not   bad   i   liked   the   lotion   better   than   the   spray   for   the   body .   it   went   on   smoother   and   darkened   a   lot   faster .   too   bad   they   don   t   make   it   in   a   bigger   size .   the   smell   was   light ,   not   too   stinky .   it   smelled   good   at   first .   it   was   just   a   few   hours   later   you   could   smell   a   slight   sunless   tanner   smell .   the   price   is   quite   high   for   the   wait   time .   it   was   3   weeks   after   i   ordered   it   before   i   received   it   at   my   home .   they   told   me   it   was   back   ordered ,   however   i   didn   t   get   this   information   until   i   called   them   myself .   a   few   days   after   i   called ,   they   sent   an   email   stating   it   was   on   back   order .   they   made   up   for   it   with   a   discount   and   a   facial   cleanser   but   i   don   t   think   i   ll   be   ordering   this   product   again .   i   guarantee   there   are   other   ones   out   there   that   work   as   well   and   don   t   cost   as   much .

great   buy !   i   bought   this   to   take   on   spring   break   and   it   was   great !   it   was   very   humid   in   cancun   and   it   dried   my   hair   very   fast .   i   have   shoulder   length   hair   and   it   dried   it   in   about   3   minutes .   it   is   great   that   it   folds   up ,   it   makes   it   nice   and   small   to   fit   in   my   tiny   bathroom   drawer .   the   cord   retracts   correctly   most   of   the   time ,   but   can   be   pushed   in   manually .   i   keep   this   dryer   in   my   bathroom   and   my   gigantic ,   expensive   one   in   my   bedroom ,   i   much   prefer   this   one !

so   far   so   good   great   price   and   it   works   great   too .   keeps   bathroom   neat   and   counter   clear .   it   has   a   very   short   cord   that   runs   to   the   outlet   which   can   be   good   for   some   and   bad   for   others .   i   really   like   the   three   speeds   .   i   m   going   to   order   another   for   our   other   bathroom .
amazing   and   worth   the   !   like   many   others ,   i   have   always   used   cheap   hair   dryers   from   target   or   the   drug   store   and   assumed   most   hair   dryers   were   the   same .   my   husband   always   complained   about   how   loud   they   were   and   how   long   they   ran   for   so   he   bought   me   the   fhi   nano   pro   for   valentine   s   day   in   pink   of   course   .   it   is   amazing   and   so   much   more   quiet !   my   thick   hair   dries   in   half   the   time   and   has   much   more   sheen   to   it .   it   has   also   cut   down   on   the   amount   of   time   to   flat   iron   it   and   extended   time   between   washes .   i   think   i   will   be   adding   the   fhi   pro   flat   iron   to   my   collection   too !   i   would   highly   recommend   it   even   thought   it   is   more   money   than   i   ever   thought   i   would   pay   for   a   hair   dryer .
hello   kitty   hair   dryer   gave   them   to   my   granddaughters   for   easter   they   use   only   hello   kitty   hairdryers   in   college
compact   and   stays   put !   these   were   purchased   for   a   vacation   home .   i   wanted   something   that   could   be   mounted   off   counter   like   in   a   hotel .   they   seem   to   work   well ,   but   i   don   t   know   how   long   they   will   last ,   with   renters .   only   time   will   tell .
love   this   hair   dryer !   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   a   couple   of   months   ago   and   really   love   it .   i   had   read   the   reviews   about   the   cord   not   being   a   spiral   stretch   cord   and   that   is   why   i   bought   this   one .   i   have   a   linen   closet   next   to   my   vanity   and   there   is   a   plug   in   inside   the   closet .   i   hang   the   dryer   in   there   out   of   sight   so   when   i   take   it   out   to   use ,   it   has   a   much   longer   cord   then   a   spiral   cord   and   i   need   the   extra   length   to   reach   my   vanity   so   it   works   perfect   for   me .   so   if   you   are   looking   for   the   spiral   cord   do   not   buy   this   unit ,   but   if   you   need   a   longer   cord   this   is   the   one   for   you .
i   don   t   get   it   this   dryer   may   do   all   the   positive   things   everyone   talks   about ,   but   the   button   to   turn   the   thing   on   and   off   is   in   exactly   the   position   that   you   would   hold   it   to   dry   your   hair ,   so   you   are   constantly   pushing   it   off   by   mistake .   that   in   itself   is   so   frustrating   that   i   can   t   see   why   everyone   thinks   that   this   thing   is   so   great .
not   even   a   year   and   the   cord   stopped   retracting   i   bought   this   for   the   retractable   cord ,   used   it   barely   three   times   a   month   since   i   got   it ,   and   the   cord   stopped   retracting .   still   a   decent   buy   if   you   get   it   on   sale ,   since   it   works   as   an   ionic   dryer   should .   would   have   been   perfect   if   it   came   with   a   diffuser   and   the   retractable   cord   hadn   t   stopped   retracting   in   less   than   a   year   with   limited   use .
twinturbo   3500   2000   watt ,   great   buy ! ! !   excelente !   this   dryer   is   light ,   strong ,   it   makes   hair   shine ,   cuts   half   of   the   time   of   drying .   i   m   a   professional   and   i   definetely   recomend   it   for   professionals .
no   cool   setting   i   have   been   wanting   a   wall   mounted   hair   dryer   for   a   long   time   and   this   was   the   only   one   i   found   that   had   a   cool   setting .   at   least   i   thought   it   had   a   cool   setting   since   the   cool   button   is   pictured   and   it   is   in   the   description ,   but   when   it   arrived   today   it   was   the   same   model   that   i   ordered   but   the   product   is   not   the   same .   very   disapointed .
i   hate   this   dryer !   very   disappointed !   this   dryer   puts   out   little   air   and   is   so   lame   compared   to   my   old   chi !   also ,   please   beware   this   company   does   not   recognize   amazon   as   a   real   company .   they   will   not   allow   you   to   register   the   dryer   even   though   it   has   all   the   registration   information   and   numbers .   the   company   is   not   user   friendly   ...   and ,   unfortunately ,   neither   is   the   appliance !   stay   away   from   the   t3 ! ! ! !

best   hair   dryer   i   ve   ever   owned   this   is   a   great   color   and   an   unbelievable   price   for   this   product .   it   s   quieter   than   my   last   hair   dryer ,   which   is   a   huge   bonus .   it   does   smell   funny   when   drying   for   about   the   first   two   weeks ,   but   then   it   s   fine .   i   ve   recommended   this   hair   dryer   to   others   i   know .
dissapointing   low   quality   hair   dryer   i   ordered   this   conair   hairdryer   to   replace   a   different   model   conair   hairdryer   that   was   great   but   had   stopped   working   after   3   years   of   heavy   use .   from   the   first   time   i   used   this   model   i   found   the   airflow   to   be   weak .   after   using   it   twice ,   the   words   next   to   the   settings   had   smeared   and   are   now   almost   completely   rubbed   off .   do   not   buy   this   model .

excellent   i   ordered   this   because   i   wanted   a   powerful .   non   ionic ,   non   tourmaline ,   non   ceramic   hair   dryer ...   which   is   almost   impossible   to   find   now ,   as   i   m   sure   you   realize   if   you   re   looking   at   this !   i   am   very   happy   with   it !   i   only   have   a   couple   of   small   cons ...   one   is   that   the   dryer   is   fairly   heavy ,   which   i   only   may   be   noticing   because   i   m   getting   old !   the   other   is   that   it   is   slightly   difficult   to   regulate   the   temperature   to   the   level   of   warm   i   want ...   it   s   not   too   bad ,   but   is   slightly   warmer   than   i   d   like .   if   you ,   like   me ,   are   searching   for   a   dryer   of   all   the   nons   i   would   recommend   this !
great   hair   dryer   but   sedu   revolution   green   3600   is   better ...   this   is   a   great   little   dryer ,   it   dried   my   thick   curly   hair   straight   in   10   mins   and   it   came   out   smooth   and   shiny   however ,   i   was   surprised   at   how   heavy   this   little   dryer   is !   the   weight   of   this   dryer   was   just   a   bit   too   much   for   me   and   it   bothered   me   in   only   10   mins   of   use   and   i   m   not   exactly   a   weakling .   the   sedu   revolution   green   3600   hair   dryer   actually   dried   my   hair   in   close   to   half   the   time   6   mins !   as   this   one   even   though   the   watts   are   a   little   lower ,   it   seems   just   as   powerful   if   not   more   and   it   looked   just   as   good !   also ,   the   sedu   green   dryer   seems   much   lighter   to   me   and   slightly   less   loud   which   made   it   much   more   enjoyable   to   use .   the   4000   is   a   great   powerful   little   dryer   but   i   am   in   love   with   the   sedu   green   3600   dryer   and   recommend   that   dryer   over   this   one .
powerful   this   is   a   great   hair   dryer .   it   s   powerful   and   dries   my   hair   quickly .   the   only   draw   draw   back   is   that   it   s   pretty   heavy .   i   can   handle   it ,   but   if   you   have   trouble   holding   your   arms   up   long   enough   to   blow   your   hair   dry ,   you   may   want   to   look   at   a   different   product .
heating   element   dies   the   heating   element   in   this   hair   dryer   stopped   working   after   three   uses .   i   am   in   a   protracted   effort   to   get   a   replacement ,   although   from   reading   other   reviews   it   does   not   appear   that   the   replacement   will   be   any   better   than   the   original .   do   not   buy   this   hair   dryer !   it   is   unreliable .
my   wife   loves   it   it   s   expensive ,   but   worth   every   penny ,   it   seems .   has   an   extra   long   cord .   i   don   t   know   what   all   the   fancy   technological   issues   are   but   when   my   wife   says   i   love   it   it   gets   five   stars .   the   cheap   hair   dryers   we   used   to   buy   would   work   for   a   few   months   then   die   this   one   seems   to   be   made   to   last   for   years .
a   really   good   hairdryer   for   reasonable   price   i   think   pretty   much   all   has   been   said   in   the   above   reviews .   it   dries   hair   quickly ,   but   doesn   t   damage   it   by   being   too   hot ,   nor   does   it   make   it   frizzy .   it   is   not   too   loud   it   is   not   exactly   quiet ,   but   nothing   dramatic .   it   is   not   too   heavy   either .   and   it   s   a   good   deal !   i   have   had   it   since   a   month   and   i   actually   go   through   the   trouble   of   blowdrying   my   hair   much   more   often   now ,   because   my   hair   looks   so   nice   now .   well ,   not   that   i   was   a   monster   before   .
a   rare   find   the   removable   lint   screen   makes   this   dryer   a   rare   find .   i   got   so   tired   of   trying   to   clean   out   my   previous   dryers ,   knowing   that   the   air   starvation   would   otherwise   cook   the   insides   and   cause   early   failure .   the   high   air   flow   is   also   a   plus .
love   this   hair   dryer ... until   it   dies !   this   is   my   second   t3   featherweight   hair   dryer   in   3   1   2   years ,   as   the   second   one   is   a   replacement   for   the   first   featherweight   that   stopped   working .   i   have   always   bought   the   cheap   hair   dryers   at   my   local   chain   stores .   i   had   no   idea   what   a   difference   a   high   quality   hair   dryer   would   make   on   my   hair .   i   have   long   hair   about   to   the   middle   my   shoulder   blades   and   whenever   i   have   to   dry   it   i   have   to   follow   up   with   a   straightening   iron .   i   am   pleased   to   report   that   with   the   t3   featherweight   i   no   longer   have   to   use   my   straightening   iron .   my   hair   is   straight ,   silky ,   and   smooth   to   the   touch ... i   was   actually   shocked   the   first   time   i   dried   my   hair .   not   only   did   it   look   great   but   it   took   less   time   than   normal   about   5   minutes   less   .   i   do   love   that   this   hair   dryer   is   so   lightweight   and   quite .   my   one   and   only   complaint   is   that   the   t3   featherweight   hair   dryer   works   for   about   1   1   2   years   before   it   shorts   out .   it   has   happened   twice   with   two   different   featherweight   dryers .   with   the   featherweight   costing   me   200   you   would   think   that   it   would   last   longer !   unfortunately   my   replacement   t3   featherweight   hair   dryer   died   yesterday   and   it   s   no   longer   under   warranty   ,   so   i   bought   a   different   professional   brand   hoping   it   will   last   longer .   sorry   t3 ,   i   had   to   move   on ! ! !   also   to   note ... when   i   received   my   first   t3   featherweight   hair   dryer   in   2006   the   replacement   one   in   2008 ,   the   company   bespoke   labs   had   a   4   year   warranty   on   their   featherweight   hair   dryers .   now   i   have   noticed   that   bespoke   labs   has   changed   the   warranty   on   this   hair   dryer   to   only   2   years ! ! !   interesting !
andis   pro   style   1600   review   i   first   discovered   this   well   functioning   hair   blower   at   a   hotel   where   i   was   staying .   the   lightweight ,   sleek   design   hair   styler   seemed   to   have   a   higher   heat   output   at   a   lower   wattage   than   any   models   i   had   owned .   i   purchased   one   from   amazon   when   i   returned   home   and   as   usual ,   received   my   items   in   record   time .   the   hair   styler   is   a   pleasure   to   use   and   i   especially   like   the   heat   options   and   focus   of   air   without   attachments   that   allows   me   to   get   the   job   done   efficiently .
it   does   blow   hot   air ...   ... but   that   is   all   the   positive   i   can   say   about   this .   i   bought   one   of   these   tonight   at   a   local   store   to   replace   my   dead   conair   folding   handle ,   retractable   cord   were   what   sold   me   originally .   however   the   cord   is   not   long   enough   to   get   to   the   top   of   your   head   it   is   half   the   length   of   my   previous   dryer   .   i   couldn   t   find   any   info   on   how   long   it   was   supposed   to   be   but   i   couldn   t   seem   to   get   it   out   any   further .   the   switch   is   impossible   to   work   with   an   arthritic   thumb .   you   shouldn   t   have   to   use   two   hands   to   turn   the   thing   on   or   off !   noise !   wow !   loud   and   irritating !   this   thing   is   going   back   tomorrow .   obviously   not   a   happy   camper   with   this   purchase .
works   better   than   others   i   was   needing   a   hair   dryer   that   wouldn   t   throw   the   breaker   when   on   high   and   this   one   is   good   although   it   did   blow   breaker   one   time   but   i   had   too   many   things   going   at   the   time   but   it   hasn   t   happened   since .   it   is   handy   to   hold   and   turn   on   and   off   or   adjust   settings   with   one   hand   so   this   is   a   keeper   for   me !
this   dryer   is   great   for   long   hair   i   bought   this   dryer   after   reading   customer   reviews   here .   overall ,   i   like   it .   br   pros   br   dries   long ,   thick   hair   very   quickly   i   have   over   shoulder   length   hair   and   it   only   took   10   minutes ,   great   because   i   have   a   10   month   old   who   doesn   t   nap   long   br   cord   keeper   no   messing   with   wrapping   up   the   cord   br   three   levels   of   heat ,   three   levels   of   speed ,   cold   shot   anyone   can   use   it ,   although   i   never   use   the   cold   shot   feature   br   comes   with   concentrator   diffuser   br   my   hair   was   fairly   frizz   free   after   use   the   ion   technology   br   decent   price   i   purchased   for   29.99   target   br   br   cons   br   fairly   heavy   not   friendly   for   those   who   have   difficulty   lifting   manuevering   arthritis   etc   br   the   cord   isn   t   that   long   if   you   were   trying   to   dry   your   child   s   hair ,   probably   be   a   pain   br   br   so ,   hopefully   it   lasts   long .   my   last   dryer   was   only   15   and   lasted   5   years   before   it   blew   out .
t3   with   the   cost !   i   love   this   lightweight   blow   dryer   it   is   fantastic   and   it   is   super   quiet   and   doesn   t   frizz   my   hair   out .   the   plug   fits   into   my   outlet   well ,   my   last   blow   dryer   it   hogged   u   to   plug   spaces .   after   reading   some   reviews   on   the   t3   and   hair   stylist   using   this   product   i   committed .   it   is   pricey   but   worth   it   to   me .
great   hairdryer   this   is   my   second   andis ,   it   worked   so   well   when   it   gave   out   i   ordered   another   one   this   past   february .   hopefully   it   ll   last   as   long   as   the   first   one .   a   great   deal   for   the   price .
love   this   space   saver   i   bought   2 !   one   for   the   master   bath   and   one   for   the   kids   bath .   it   has   helped   with   the   clutter   in   the   kids   bathroom   soooo   much !   and   since   it   s   out   all   the   time   it   reminds   my   girls   to   dry   their   hair .   i   love   it !   i   would   recommend   it   to   anybody   with   kids .
fhi   heat   nano   salon   pro   i   spent   over   100   for   a   hairdryer .   i   used   it   twice   and   had   to   return   it   because   it   had   no   heat .   i   wasn   t   impressed   for   over   100 .
after   years   of   good   service   it   went   out   with   a   bang   i   have   had   this   hair   dryer   for   a   few   years ,   and   it   has   served   me   well   up   until   now .   just   this   morning   i   was   blow   drying   my   hair   when   sparks   began   to   fly   out   of   the   dryer ,   into   my   hair   and   onto   the   floor .   in   shock ,   i   threw   the   dryer   to   the   ground   where   it   continued   to   spark   and   hiss   a   few   more   times   until   it   died .   i   figured   it   must   have   reached   it   s   end   after   a   long   life   of   use ,   but   after   reading   some   of   the   other   reviews   here   i   am   surprised   to   learn   that   this   has   happened   to   others ,   and   so   soon   after   their   purchase .   please   stay   away   from   this   hair   dryer   unless   you   want   to   be   scared   out   of   your   wits   when   you   least   expect   it   and   risk   burning   off   a   part   of   your   hair   or   carpet   .
impressive   dryer   i   was   looking   for   a   new   dryer   and   spent   some   time   online   doing   my   research .   this   product   was   generally   well   liked   so   i   spent   the   extra   money   and   purchased   it .   i   m   not   sure   it   is   as   overwhelmingly   better   than   all   others   that   s   a   tough   claim   ,   but   i   have   to   say   that   it   is   a   pretty   good   product .   i   have   very   thick   color   treated   blonde   hair   so   i   have   to   be   careful   not   to   damage   it   but   yet   i   don   t   want   it   to   take   all   day   to   dry .   this   dryer   allows   me   to   dry   my   hair   very   quickly   and   without   damage .   i   really   like   the   difuser   too .   it   is   a   bit   heavy   but   that   isn   t   a   big   deal   since   i   don   t   take   it   on   trips   and   my   arm   doesn   t   get   too   tired   since   it   doesn   t   take   too   long   to   dry .   overall ,   i   rated   four   stars   because   although   it   isn   t   perfect ,   i   do   really   like   the   performance   of   this   dryer .
great   product !   i   spent   a   lot   of   time   comparing   the   features   and   benefits   of   different   hair   dryers   before   buying   this   one .   i   have   a   babyliss   and   like   it ,   but   wanted   to   try   something   new .   i   didn   t   see   a   big   difference   initially ,   but   when   i   used   this   and   the   babyliss   on   alternate   days ,   i   was   amazed   at   how   quickly   the   fhi   drys   my   hair .   i   can   exercise   in   the   morning   before   work   because   this   cuts   down   the   amount   of   time   i   need   to   get   ready .   it   is   lightweight   and   quiet ,   and   i   hope   that   it   lives   up   to   its   claim   to   have   a   longer   life .
fabulous   it   does   everything   it   says   it   will   nice   drying ,   not   too   hot ,   very   even ,   and   the   attachments   work   well .   the   heat   is   very   even   and   it   does   a   good   job .   this   is   kind   of   a   cadillac   of   hair   dryers   for   people   who   want   to   pamper   their   hair .   i   love   it !
phenomenal   i   got   this   as   a   second   hair   dryer   for   traveling   and   to   leave   at   my   boyfriend   s   house   so   i   didn   t   have   to   lug   my   conair   213x   infiniti   pro   about   40 ,   and   much   heavier   than   this   one   back   and   forth   every   weekend .   this   was   a   great   choice .   the   dryer   is   much   much   lighter   than   what   i   m   used   to   and   has   a   nice   smooth   feel   as   in ,   it   doesn   t   feel   light   plastic   under   my   hands ,   but   more   of   a   rubbery   feel   very   pleasant !   .   it   is   also   just   as   powerful   as   the   213x .   it   has   2   speeds   gale   force   wind   and   normal   ,   and   3   heat   settings .   i   use   the   gale   force   winds   on   medium   heat   and   my   hair   4   5   below   my   shoulder ,   thin   medium   thickness ,   is   dry   in   under   3   minutes .   my   younger   sister   tried   it   out   and   put   it   on   gale   force   high   heat   and   she   said   it   didn   t   stay   on   for   more   than   a   few   seconds .   my   thoughts   are   it   could   have   been   my   outlet   i   live   in   a   very   old   apartment   building   circa   1900s   unable   to   handle   the   current   flow   or   it   could   have   been   a   safety   feature   of   the   hair   dryer   to   prevent   over   heating .   either   way   its   not   a   problem   for   me   since   high   heat   hurts   my   head   and   ears   and   makes   me   feel   as   if   i   m   destroying   my   hair !   all   in   all   its   a   great   value   for   the   price .
best   face   cream   ever   i   purchased   the   olay   complete   lotion   for   sensitive   skin   just   looking   for   a   light   spf   hydrating   lotion   to   wear   under   makeup   that   wouldn   t   totally   ruin   my   skin   like   everything   else .   i   have   super   sensitive ,   fair   skin   and   am   slightly   acne   prone   and   after   trying   what   seemed   like   every   sensitive   product   under   the   sun   without   success   i   was   desperate   even   cetaphil   gives   me   ruddy   blemished   skin   for   pete   s   sake !   .   so   my   dermatologist   suggested   i   try   this   olay   lotion   she   called   it   the   oil   of   old   lady   cream   ha   and   to   my   delight   this   stuff   worked   wonders   beyond   my   wildest   dreams !   this   lotion   not   only   was   light ,   non   greasy   and   proved   a   great   foundation   for   liquid   and   powder   makeup ,   but   miraculously   smoothed   my   complexion   and   lightened   erased   my   post   blemish   marks   and   general   ruddiness .   i   have   received   so   many   compliments   on   my   complexion   since   using   this   product   it   s   amazing !   i   highly   recommend   this   lotion   to   anyone   looking   for   a   complete   protection   and   rejuvenation   of   the   skin   and   at   less   than   12   a   bottle ,   who   could   resist !  
peroxyl   peroxyl   isn   t   available   where   i   live .   the   shipment   was   slower   than   i   expected   but   arrived   at   the   end   of   the   promised   time   frame .   the   product   is   excellent   for   gum   problems   and   was   recommended   by   my   dentist .   it   shouldn   t   be   used   without   a   dentist   s   approval .
not   so   good   i   thought   these   rollers   were   really   cute   but   i   ended   up   giving   them   away .   i   dont   know   if   its   that   the   heat   is   uneven   or ,   or   maybe   the   rollers   are   too   small ,   or   what ,   but   i   never   got   a   good   bouncy   head   of   softly   curled   hair   out   of   these .   i   dont   think   they   heat   up   particularly   quickly ,   either .   they   might   be   good   for   a   kid .
hope   in   a   jar   spf   20   i   have   been   using   this   product   for   over   a   year .   i   have   very   light ,   delicate   skin   and   really   dislike   anything   greasy   or   heavy .   hope   in   a   jar   either   formulation   is   wonderful   light ,   non   greasy ,   causes   no   blemishes .   i   am   really   surprised   by   the   negative   reviews !   i   am   in   my   60   s   and   have   tried   just   about   everything   on   the   market   and   for   the   price   this   product   is   uncomparable .
great   this   lotion   turns   you   brown   almost   immediately   but   because   it   has   a   bronzer   the   deep   tan   doesn   t   last   long   unless   you   go   to   the   tanning   bed   everyday .   but   it   s   good   for   a   quick   tan .
lovely   scent ,   non   irritating   i   m   really   pleased   with   this   product   and   hope   the   dial   in   this   scent   will   remain   available   for   purchase   over   time .   i   use   antibacterial   liquid   pump   soap   in   both   kitchen   and   bath ,   but   prefer   a   non   medicinal   and   non   floral   scent .   the   scent   of   this   is   very   light   and   smells   exactly   like   apples   in   the   autumn ,   with   just   a   light   hint   of   spice   in   the   background .   the   product   lathers   up   very   well ,   but   rinses   clean   easily ,   leaving   my   hands   soft   and   feeling   healthy   and   refreshed ,   but   not   at   all   greasy   like   a   moisturizer   usually   feels .   the   scent   lingers   only   for   a   little   while   and   does   not   make   me   feel   like   i   am   leaving   it   behind   in   foods   i   prepare   after   washing   my   hands .   i   ve   had   guests   over   since   i   bought   this   soap   and   both   times   they   commented   on   what   a   lovely   scent   it   had   when   they   washed   their   hands   in   the   bathroom .   this   is   my   favorite   so   far   in   any   of   the   types   and   scents   available   from   standard   brands   of   liquid   antibacterial   soaps   in   a   pump   container .   i   also   love   that   i   could   buy   in   volume   at   a   good   price ,   so   as   to   not   run   out   suddently .   i   would   recommend   this   product   highly   for   those   who   prefer   antibacterial   liquid   soaps ,   but   aren   t   fond   of   flowery   or   medicinal   scents .
amazing !   this   will   curl   even   the   thinnest   finest   hair   and   the   curls   last   all   day . instantly   heats   up   and   doesn   t   burn   hair .   hairspray   and   or   styling   gel   will   extend   the   life   of   the   curls   but   is   not   necessary . i   can   do   my   whole   head   myself   in   around   15   20minutes   and   i   have   long   hair .   the   only   down   side   i   have   found   is   that   if   you   burn   yourself   you   definately   know   it .   not   safe   for   kids   to   use   because   of   how   hot   it   gets .
my   most   pleasant   surprise   in   a   long   long   time   when   i   ordered   the   anti   aging   eye   roller   i   thought ,   yeah   sure ,   this   will   be   like   any   other   product   that   advertises   the   reduction   of   eye   bags   and   puffiness .   but ,   and   i   mean   a   big   but ,   i   found   that   it   really   does   reduce   the   appearance   of   bags   and   puffiness .   i   am   glad   i   tried   it   and   i   am   glad   it   is   an   olay   product   because   i   use   olay   exclusively   for   face   and   body .   anyway ,   i   would   and   have   recommended   this   product   to   others   so   they   can   try   it   and   other   olay   products .   i   don   t   mind   asking ,   because   i   am   on   a   fixed   income ,   for   coupons ,   very   substantial   coupons   for   olay   products .   i   also   like   the   regenerist   moisturizer   which   i   use   at   least   twice   a   day .   thank   you .

j   adore   mustela   my   boy   does   not   like   when   i   put   any   cream   on   his   face .   he   does   not   mind   mustela   dermo   pediatrics   stelaprotect .   skin   is   so   smooth   and   smells   lovely .   i   can   only   recommend   it !
fantastic   hair   product !   i   have   really   dry   hair   and   this   product   really   helps   style   and   hydrate   my   hair .   easy   to   use ,   apply   before   blow   dry .   i   noticed   a   difference   the   first   time   i   used   it .   i   have   been   using   it   with   the   moroccanoil .
sharper   than   it   looks   it   does   the   job .   i   could   use   a   bit   longer   razor ,   as   it   is   a   pretty   small   head .   it   s   also   a   lot   sharper   than   i   thought   it   would   be .
great   product   i   had   purchased   this   item   years   ago   at   an   origins   store ,   not   even   noticing   the   brand   name .   i   wanted   to   replace   it   and   when   i   saw   this   on   amazon   i   was   thrilled .   this   is   such   a   great   handy   thing   to   use   for   lotion .   my   husband   hates   me   asking   him   to   lotion   my   back ,   so   this   is   great ,   and   washable   which   i   love .   i   also   use   an   oil   for   sore   back   muscles   sometimes   and   i   can   use   this   to   apply   it   myself .   great   item .
did   not   work   as   i   hoped   i   used   the   roller   on   a   facail   scar   i   have   that   i   cover   with   makeup ,   it   is   not   deep   but   im   very   self   conscious   of   it .   i   used   the   roller   on   it   as   instrusted   but   found   that   it   actually   made   the   area   rolled   more   scar   like   red   and   leathery   i   would   not   advise   using   this   on   scars .
great   service   this   little   tin   full   of   solid   perfume   arrived   quickly ,   is   packaged   nicely ,   is   really   handy   for   purse   or   gym   bag .   it   smells   great .   my   only   wish   is   that   smell   would   last   longer   i   was   hoping   a   solid   perfume   could   do   so .   after   about   1   2   hour   the   smell   is   gone .
great   trimmer   this   is   my   second   mb   200   that   i   ve   owned .   the   first   one   was   amazingly   convenient .   it   held   a   charge   for   around   a   month .   with   no   accessories ,   it   was   great   for   traveling .   unfortunally   my   cats   knocked   it   off   of   the   sink   with   the   guard   extended .   it   broke   a   small   piece   inside   and   the   guard   doesn   t   work   anymore .   so   i   suggest   to   store   it   with   the   guard   all   the   way   in   so   that   can   t   happen .   other   than   that ,   i   m   completely   satisfied .
paraben   disappointment   zero   stars !   br   with   all   of   those   natural   and   safe   ingredients ,   komenuka   bijin   blew   it   when   they   added   the   very   unsafe   and   unhealthy   chemical   preservative   paraben .   br   disappointed   beyond   belief !
just   like   the   perfume .   i   have   avon   s   haiku   perfume   and   i   absolutely   love   it .   i   received   the   powder   as   a   gift   and   it   s   the   same   wonderful   scent !   i   have   not   purchased   from   this   seller ,   so   that   s   all   up   you .   those   of   you   who   worry   about   the   shimmer   as   the   others   state ,   it   is   very   very   light .   to   be   honest ,   i   just   started   using   the   powder   again   and   i   didn   t   notice   the   shimmer .   i   recommend   applying   non   scented   lotion   then   the   powder   after   you   get   out   of   the   shower .
excellent   product !   a   must   have   1   great   smell   br   2   excellent   cleaner ,   even   stubborn   mascara   without   irritation   br   3   reduces   pore   size   br   4   makes   your   moisturizer   work   better   br   5   makes   your   make   up   glide   on   br   br   purchase   it !
it   really   works   i   got   this   for   my   daughter ,   who   has   really   frizzy   wavy   hair .   she   s   tried   several   brands   of   flat   irons ,   including   the   expensive   ones .   she   says   she   really   loves   this   one ,   and   it   s   her   favorite .   she   says   it   straightens   her   hair   considerably   faster   than   the   others ,   and   stays   straighter   longer .   if   you   could   see   her   hair ,   you   d   know   this   is   no   small   feat .   i   highly   recommend   it .
works   pretty   good   this   cream   works   very   nicely   on   my   eyes .   i   mainly   bought   it   because   it   has   the   copper   peptides   that   everyone   seems   to   be   raving   about .   i   see   some   improvements   however ,   i   think   that   with   any   skin   care   products   you   need   to   give   it   a   few   months   to   see   true   results . also   i   noticed   that   this   cream   can   irritate   so   make   sure   you   put   only   a   little .   i   went   crazy   putting   on   extra   daily   out   of   desperation   lol   and   i   felt   a   burning   irritation   around   my   eyes .   still   a   good   cream   but   you   may   want   to   shop   around   to   see   what   else   is   out   there .
best   product   ever   for   natural   hair   care !   i   ve   been   natural   for   about   a   month   now   and   i   ve   been   trying   products   out   in   hopes   to   soften   and   moisturize   my   hair .   this   product   was   recommended   by   the   natural   hair   community   on   you   tube   so   i   decided   to   give   it   a   try .   let   s   just   say   this   will   be   in   my   hair   care   regimen   for   a   very   long   time .   not   only   did   it   soften   my   4a   4c   hair   texture   which   is   as   coarse   as   it   gets ,   it   also   helps   seal   in   moisture   and   the   ingredients   are   all   natural   and   essential .   what   can   i   say   other   than   i   m   in   love   with   vatika !   where   has   vatika   been   all   my   life   this   is   a   must   buy   if   you   want   the   feeling   of   baby   soft   hair !   also   i   ve   read   that   this   has   thickenend ,   and   grown   hair   faster   than   normal   rates .   i   ll   just   have   to   sit   back   and   wait   for   that   experience ...
perfect   lighted   magnifying   mirror   mine   came   yesterday   and   it   is   perfect !   i   was   looking   for   a   lighted   magnifying   mirror   that   would   wall   mount   and   i   didn   t   want   to   pay   an   arm   and   a   leg   for   it .   this   was   under   60   and   it   is   all   i   could   ask   for .   i   bought   the   chrome .   it   really   does   the   job .   thanks   for   providing   such   a   superior   product   at   such   a   great   price !
recommended   product   this   is   a   worthy   product   from   a   notable   seller .   the   customer   service   is   superb ,   shipping   is   quick ,   and   the   minoxidil   solution   has   offered   personal   results   that   i   haven   t   seen   with   5   solutions .   i   ve   used   other   15   solutions ,   and   this   is   the   one   i   choose   by   preference .   the   azelaic   acid   is   a   theoretical   dht   inhibitor   testosterone   conversion   to   dht   production   is   the   absolute   cause   of   the   hair   follicle   demise .... aka   hair   loss   ,   and   combined   with   the   15   minoxidil   mixture ,   the   solution   offers   the   possibility   of   solid   regrowth   .   honestly ,   i   ve   used   this   product   in   combination   with   additional   regrowth   methods   and   am   receiving   results   that   i   have   not   had   in   the   past   using   other   regrowth   combinations   i   ve   used   this   15   solution   for   roughly   5   6   months   .   i   began   thinning   in   my   early   20   s   and   by   25   was   shaving   my   head   which ,   i   didn   t   mind   so   much   but   wasn   t   completely   doing   so   by   preference   .   i   m   currently   29 ,   and   my   hair   is   gaining   the   density   as   it   once   was   at   18 .   i   recommend   the   product .
buy   petroleum   jelly   instead   costs   way   less   this   simply   felt   like   a   lighter   petroleum   jelly   and   was   in   a   tube .   been   using   it   for   a   week   and   notice   no   difference .   easily   wears   off   in   five   minutes .   clinique   s   lip   scrub   made   my   lips   feel   better .
beware   powerful   stuff ! !   i   ordered   the   product   about   two   weeks   ago .   shipping   was   fast ,   the   product   came   in   a   plain   box   and   was   well   packaged .   i   have   several   skin   tags   on   my   neck   and   applied   product   carefully   with   a   q   tip   as   directed .   it   has   a   stinging   sensation   on   application   so   i   was   careful   not   to   apply   too   much   solution   to   the   tags .   i   got   some   of   the   solution   on   the   surrounding   skin   but   applied   the   ointment   to   stop   the   burn .   the   solution   burns   the   skin   very   quickly   so   you   have   to   be   carefuly   not   to   apply   too   much .   the   burns   has   caused   my   skin   to   become   discolored ,   my   neck   now   looks   worse   than   before   and   my   tags   haven   t   fallen   off   yet .   that   was   a   week   ago ,   so   i   will   now   use   a   small   brush   to   apply   and   hopefully   this   will   prove   a   better   applicator   than   the   q   tip .   i   am   now   looking   forward   to   be   rid   of   the   tags   and   acid   burns   on   my   neck .   if   you   are   interested   in   purchasing   this   product ,   please   proceed   with   caution .   maybe   the   suppliers   could   provide   a   small   applicator   with   this   purchase .
definitely   recommend   this   mirror   i   ve   been   using   this   mirror   for   ten   to   fifteen   years .   recently ,   the   bulbs   went   out   and   i   discovered   that   there   s   no   easy   way   to   replace   them ,   so   it   seemed   worth   it   to   just   buy   a   new   mirror .   actually ,   this   one   is   a   little   bit   better .   i   think   that   lighting   technology   has   changed   a   bit   since   i   last   bought   it   and   the   lever   that   changes   the   lighting   is   smoother .   my   last   one   became   very   difficult   to   move   and   it   eventually   broke   off   every   time   i   tried   to   move   it .   br   br   all   in   all ,   the   option   to   change   the   lighting   is   fantastic   and   it   gives   off   plenty   of   light   to   be   able   to   do   my   makeup   in   low   light   situations .   i   m   hoping   it   will   last   another   ten   to   fifteen   years ,   this   is   well   worth   the   money .
chi   ceramic   flat   iron   works   pretty   well   and   leaves   my   hair   silky   smooth .   i   have   thick   hair   so   sometimes   it   doesn   not   want   to   hold   the   style   that   i   wish   is   to   hold   but   the   chi   ceramic   flat   iron   works   better   than   most   other   flat   irons   i   have   used   and   and   leaves   my   hair   silky   and   smooth .   so   far   i   have   not   noticed   any   hair   damage   or   breakage ,   a   big   plus .
great   product !   i   have   heard   about   enjoy   products   a   few   times ,   and   it   was   recommended   by   my   hairstylist .   i   still   went   out   on   a   limb   by   ordering   this   pomade ,   but   i   love   it ! ! !   i   have   long   straight   hair ,   but   after   i   blowdry   straighten   it ,   it   s   still   a   little   frizzy   and   i   have   flyaways .   this   pomade   helps   a   ton ,   you   only   need   about   the   size   of   a   nickel ,   and   you   can   use   it   from   root   to   tip   without   it   looking   oily   of   course   if   you   use   too   much ,   that   might   not   be   the   case   .   also ,   is   smells   soooo   great !   the   price   is   good ,   i   can   see   it   lasting   for   a   long   time   since   a   little   goes   a   long   way .   i   would   definitely   recommend   this   product   to   anyone   with   the   same   need   as   i   had .  
rucci   1x   10x   pretty   durable   body   if   closed .   magnification   is   pretty   clear .   don   t   like   that   there   were   1x   10x   stickers   on   the   mirror .
new   replacement   heads   make   noise !   i   ve   been   using   the   sonicare   for   many ,   many   years ,   probably   15   years ,   when   they   first   came   out .   i   have   the   advance   handle   and   philips   no   longer   makes   replacement   heads   for   the   advance   handles   but   instead   has   a   slightly   different   head   called   e   series   that   is   supposed   to   fit   the   advance   handle .   i   ordered   the   three   pack   of   the   e   series   and   it   does   fit   the   original   advance   handle   but   be   advised   that   he   makes   a   louder   noise   when   in   use .   apparently ,   the   magnets   on   the   e   series   don   t   match   what   was   originally   designed   for   the   advance   handles .   i   called   philips   and   demonstrated   the   noise   difference   over   the   phone   to   the   technician   and   even   she   could   tell   the   significant   difference   in   noise .   it   s   not   unbareable   by   any   stretch   but   is   not   as   comfortable   as   using   the   old   replacement   heads .   the   technician   did   not   know   about   the   difference   in   noise ,   checked   with   others   and   then   got   back   to   me   that ,   yes ,   there   is   a   difference   in   noise .   philips   should   tell   the   user   about   this   difference .   it   s   no   big   deal ,   but   should   be   disclosed .   br   br   what   i   found   interesting   also   is   that   the   new   package   says   to   replace   the   heads   every   3   months .   the   old   packaging   said   every   6   months .   when   i   asked   the   technician   about   this   and   asked   if   this   meant   that   the   new   heads   were   not   made   as   well   as   the   old   heads   and   was   this   part   of   the   american   corporate   conspiracy   to   have   consumers   buy   more   and   spend   more ,   she   said   they   changed   the   recommendation   on   the   advice   of   dental   professionals .   whether   these   dental   professionals   are   part   of   the   conspiracy ,   i   do   not   know .   whether   the   new   heads   are   not   as   well   built   as   the   old ,   i   also   don   t   know .   but   in   any   event ,   since   i   ve   been   using   the   sonicare   for   the   past   15   years   or   so   i   ve   changed   heads   every   six   months   or   so   and   my   teeth   have   not   fallen   out   and   i   ve   had   no   complaints   from   my   dentist .   i   guess   i   ll   update   this   review   four   months   from   now   and   advise   whether   my   teeth   have   fallen   out   and   are   full   of   cavities   all   because   i   didn   t   change   the   replacement   head   after   three   months .   br   br   but   to   philips   credit ,   at   least   they   didn   t   simply   stop   making   a   head   to   fit   the   advance   handle   and   thereby   force   the   consumer   to   buy   a   new   handle   for   the   new   heads .   the   e   series   does   fit ,   albeit   not   perfectly .   br   br   stay   tuned . e   replacement   head   after   three   months .   but   to   philips   credit ,   at   least   they   didn   t   simply   stop   making   a   head   to   fit   the   advance   handle   and   thereby   force   the   consumer   to   buy   a   new   handle   for   the   new   heads .   the   e   series   does   fit ,   albeit   not   perfectly .   stay   tuned .
low   quality   conair   the   dryer   overheats   and   shuts   off   and   cannot   be   reset   you   have   to   wait   until   it   cools   down   on   its   own   or   only   use   it   on   a   low   heat   setting   the   tube   that   connects   the   bonnet   is   not   very   durable .   conair   could   do   better   my   last   two   conair   dryers   have   not   lasted .   i   can   t   recommend   this   item .   and   note   i   bought   this   unit   from   a   store ,   not   amazon ,   so   conair   cannot   blame   their   lack   of   quality   on   amazon  
a   review   for   guys   i   didn   t   know   what   the   attachments   were   for   so   i   threw   them   out .   i   turned   it   on   and   it   blew   hot   air .   5   stars .
has   been   working   fine   for   me   this   drier   has   been   working   great   for   me   for   the   last   few   months   and   i   m   pretty   sure   i   am   using   it   harder   than   most .   i   have   it   out   at   the   barn   with   my   horse   and   use   it   it   dry   him   off   after   a   workout   and   a   bath .   this   means   that   while   it   is   only   working   on   short   hair ,   it   has   a   lot   of   surface   area   to   cover   and   it   holds   up   the   whole   time .   only   bad   thing   i   have   to   say   is   that   the   less   than   ideal   environment   with   lots   of   dirt   has   caused   me   to   see   a   fleck   of   rust   or   two   on   the   front   grill ,   but   they   don   t   seem   to   be   spreading   and   they   haven   t   given   me   any   trouble .
in   regard   to   other   reviews   i   originally   bought   this   model   hangup   hair   dryer   because   of   the   cord   hanger .   in   all   honesty ,   i   never   use   the   hanger .   i   leave   my   cord   dangle .   it   actually   helps   to   detract   from   the   power   cord   that   runs   to   the   outlet .   if   i   hang   the   cord ,   i   actually   feel   like   that   just   spreads   out   the   cord   mess .   that   may   be   something   to   consider   if   you   are   buying   this   model   for   the   cord   hanger .   the   nighlight   is   not   as   bright   as   some   of   these   reviews   would   have   you   believe .   if   you   go   from   having   a   completely   dark   bathroom   to   having   this   light ,   you   will   notice   the   room   is   much   brighter   at   night ,   but   the   light   is   no   brighter   than   any   other   night   light .   you   will   need   the   right   size   allen   wrench   to   switch   the   dryer   from   1200w   to   1600w   as   this   does   not   come   with   the   dryer .   i   had   no   problems   with   the   screw   length   for   mounting   as   others   have   stated ,   so   they   may   have   fixed   that   problem .   this   dryer   is   much   quiter   than   my   previous   dryer   which   was   an   1875w   regular   handheld   model .   it   s   not   silent ,   but   it   is   quieter   than   any   dryer   i   ve   owned .   even   though   this   and   other   wall   mounted   dryers   have   lower   wattage ,   i   don   t   notice   a   significate   increase   in   drying   time   maybe   a   minute   or   two   .   i   actually   prefer   the   lower   wattage   now   because   i   m   not   blasting   my   hair   or   scalp !   with   heat   which   tended   to   cause   split   ends   and   fry   my   hair   after   continued   use   i   don   t   curl   or   use   a   flat   iron ,   so   the   difference   is   purely   a   result   of   the   hair   dryers   .   also ,   once   i   finish   blow   drying ,   my   hair   looks   like   it   will   for   the   rest   of   the   day   an   moderate   amount   of   volume   ,   whereas   with   the   1875w   dryer ,   my   hair   would   be   a   pouf   ball   first   thing   in   the   morning   and   gradually   flatten   to   my   head   by   the   end   of   the   day .   other   notes   the   dryer   itself   is   a   medium   size .   i   like   that   it   s   not   one   of   the   tiny   ones   because   i   feel   like   it   s   not   flimsy   and   weak   even   if   smaller   ones   really   aren   t   .   it   s   also   not   as   big   and   heavy   as   full   sized   dryers ,   so   i   find   that   i   move   it   around   much   more   and   get   more   even   drying .
sadly   disappointed   i   upgraded   from   a   gold   n   hot   1200   for   this   one   as   was   so   excited   to   try   it .   unfortunately ,   like   the   rest   of   the   1   star   reviews ,   the   dryer   frequently   overheats   and   then   pop !   it   stops   working .
great   product   i   bought   this   dryer   because   my   hairdresser   has   one   like   it .   i   have   naturally   curly   hair   that   i   straighten .   this   dryer   is   awesome .   it   dries   hair   quicker   than   most ,   leaving   no   frizz   in   the   hair .   my   hair   feels   smoother   and   healthier   after   using   it .   i   would   recommend   this   product   to   everyone .   some   of   the   reviews   that   i   read   on   here   before   purchasing ,   said   that   a   lot   of   people   didn   t   like   the   controls   because   their   hand   would   hit   it   and   just   turn   it   off ,   i   don   t   understand   this ,   if   you   hold   it   in   your   hand   the   right   way ,   it   works   fine   without   hitting   the   controls .
a   good   deal   this   product   is   of   good   quality   for   a   very   good   price .   also   lightweight   and   not   too   noisy .
perfect   for   using   on   kids   hair ,   all   around   dryer   i   have   owned   several   wall   mount   dryers   and   they   seem   to   be   chintzy   overly   small   and   too   hot ,   way   too   hot   to   dry   my   kids   hair .   this   one   is   a   bit   bigger ,   feels   great   in   the   hand   and   has   a   little   switch   you   can   set   to   make   it   run   either   warm   or   hot .   my   kids   no   longer   scream   and   yell   when   i   dry   their   hair .   it   has   plenty   of   power   and   it   looks   good   too .   the   only   drawbacks   are   the   length   of   the   cord   could   be   a   tad   longer   ,   and   the   back   vent   sometimes   pulls   a   hair   or   two   neither   are   deal   breakers .   i   m   very   happy   with   this   dryer .
don   t   buy   from   amazon   i   usually   love   amazon   and   buy   a   lot   of   cd   s ,   books ,   etc .   don   t   buy   this   hairdryer   from   any   discount   supplier .   i   bought   one ,   expected   a   genuine   article ,   didn   t   get   a   manufacturer   s   warranty   and   am   stuck   with   a   dryer   that   doesn   t   get   hot .   i   contacted   the   seller ,   and   because   i   was   certain   this   was   authentic ,   i   threw   the   box   away   and   now   i   m   on   the   hook   for   100   plus .   do   not   buy   from   anyone   other   than   a   seller   who   can   provide   a   warranty   from   the   manufacturer .   these   dryers   have   a   tendency   after   a   couple   of   years   to   burn   up .   my   last   one   shorted   right   at   my   vanity .   scary .   get   the   warranty .   please .
t3   tourmaline   ceramic   ionic   hair   dryer   great   product .   just   be   sure   to   read   the   instructions ...   the   first   time   i   used   the   blowdryer   it   set   my   smoke   alarm   off   because   of   the   manufacturing   residue   in   the   blowdryer .   no   real   need   to   worry   because   there   was   a   warning   in   the   manual .   it   was   just   inconvenient ...   had   to   open   all   the   windows   and   turn   off   the   dryer   to   get   the   smoke   detector   to   go   off .   there   is   an   odd   smell   the   first   time   you   use   the   dryer   but   again ,   this   was   all   described   in   the   owner   s   manual .   other   than   that ,   i   ve   had   compliments   that   my   hair   looks   smoother .   i   noticed   less   frizz   and   my   hair   feels   softer .   it   s   a   bit   pricey   but   a   good   product   if   you   re   looking   to   splurge   a   little .
no   warranty   we   bought   the   t3   featherweight   through   amazon   less   than   a   year   ago .   the   dryer   died   yesterday .   i   contacted   t3   and   they   stated   that   they   would   not   honor   their   warranty   because   amazon   was   not   an   authorized   dealer .   they   offered   to   replace   the   dryer   for   50.00 .   i   advised   them   i   would   let   amazon   know   that   the   dryers   they   are   selling   are   not   backed   by   a   warranty   because   they   are   not   an   authorized   dealer .   sounds   like   a   bunch   of   manure   to   me .
lasted   but   two   years   i   have   this   dryer   but   it   s   currently   mounted   to   my   wall ,   unused ,   because   it   burned   out   after   two   years   of   mostly   daily   use .   still ,   i   love   the   style   and   plan   to   get   another   one .
why   did   i   wait   so   long   we   ve   all   used   the   wall   mounted   blow   dryers   in   hotels ,   and   then   gone   home   to   the   unit   sitting   on   the   counter   top   in   our   bathroom .   i   finally   broke   down   and   purchased   this   wall   mounted   unit   and   put   it   in   my   wife   s   bathroom .   it   only   took   a   couple   of   minutes   to   install   the   mounting   plate   with   the   supplied   hardware .   what   a   difference .   no   more   cords   dangling   in   the   sink   and   knocking   items   on   the   floor .   i   chose   this   model   because   it   has   a   removable   filter   to   allow   easier   cleaning .   my   feelings   about   blow   dryers   is   that   they   re   pretty   much   all   the   same   within   price   ranges .   i   don   t   expect   a   35   item   to   last   10   years .   .   .   i   will   happily   replace   it   when   it   wears   out .   this   one   works   fine   and   i   don   t   have   any   complaints .   i   d   buy   it   again   tomorrow   if   faced   with   the   same   need   and   happily   recommend   it   to   anyone   who   s   considering   a   purchase .
flawed   my   blow   dryer   broke   after   less   than   3   weeks   of   sporadic   use .   i   thought   it   was   great   at   first ,   but   was   very   disappointed   that   it   broke   so   quickly .
pretty   good   this   dryer   has   good   power   my   hair   comes   out   good   thin   straight   hair   .   it   s   a   bit   heavy   so   it   wouldn   t   be   good   for   someone   with   gripping   or   strength   concerns .   the   on   off   and   heat   buttons   are   not   placed   well .   i   accidentally   turn   the   dryer   off   several   times   while   i   m   drying   my   hair ,   but   that   is   only   a   minor   inconvenience .
hair   dryer   burnt   out   in   9   months   100   is   a   lot   to   pay   for   a   hair   dryer   that   only   lasts   for   9   months .   don   t   bother .   if   you   want   to   spend   the   money   on   a   high   end   hair   dryer ,   make   sure   it   has   a   guarantee .   this   one   does   not .
makes   life   easier   i   bought   this   product   almost   3   years   ago .   it   is   so   nice   to   be   hands   free   and   feel   confident   it   will   stick   to   the   counter   or   glass   .   i   recently   bought   it   as   a   gift   for   my   mom .   she   loves   it .
andis   1600   w   hang   up   dryer   fits   the   bill   perfectly .   i   sought   a   small ,   efficient   hair   dryer   that   could   hang   up   in   my   very   small   bathroom   and   be   unobtrusive   but   effective .   the   cord   hanger   is   a   plus ,   allows   the   coiled   cord   to   be   placed   out   of   the   way .   i   disagree   with   some   reviewers   who   found   it   very   noisy   on   high   setting .   this   dryer   is   just   fine .
love   it   i   saw   this   at   my   sister   in   laws ,   she   has   one   in   each   bathroom   and   loved   it .   its   out   of   the   way   and   always   neat   looking .   it   has   lots   of   power   for   no   bigger   than   it   is   and   just   a   nice   addition   to   my   bathroom ,   convenient   but   out   of   the   way   also .   power   cord   is   long   enough   but   not   too   long .   love   it ,   love   it ,   love   it ! !
good   product ...   product   purchased   about   one   month   ago   and   so   far   we   are   pleased .   the   unit   dries   wet   hair   quickly   and   leaves   hair   soft ,   not   frizzy .   a   bit   large   in   the   hand ,   but   light   enough   not   to   be   cumbersome .   the   key   verdict   will   be   determined   by   how   long   the   unit   will   last ...   as   the   previous   2   units   vidal   sasson   burned   out   in   less   than   12   months .
amazing   results !   this   hair   dryer   has   worked   wonders .   i   am   in   the   process   of   transitioning   from   relaxed   to   natural   and   this   product   creates   lovely   results .   leaves   hair   straight   with   a   lovely   sheen .   also ,   it   takes   maybe   5   10   minutes   to   dry   hair !
best   hairdryer   ever   owned !   this   hairdryer   is   fantastic .   it   is   powerful ,   which   means   it   dries   fast ,   lightweight ,   and   includes   many   different   settings .   the   extra   attachments   also   help   for   different   types   of   drying .   although   other   reviews   say   it   is   heavy   and   bulky ,   the   andis   hairdryer   is   far   from   it .   i   would   recommend   it   for   anyone .
gets   the   job   done   but   the   plastic   switch   that   holds   the   hard   hat   up   is   kind   of   flimsy .   don   t   move   around   too   much   while   you   re   underneath   the   hood   and   you   ll   be   fine .   if   they   can   redesign   the   hood   lock   on   this   device ,   it   d   be   a   five   star   item ,   because   my   roller   sets   come   out   swell   when   using   it .
weak   dryer   i   bought   this   dryer ,   but   when   i   recieved   it   and   try   it   was   not   as   powerful   as   i   thought   it   would   be   .   then   when   i   wanted   to   returne   it   they   said   they   will   be   15   restucking   fee   which   sounds   really   sucks .   if   i   did   not   open   to   try   it   how   do   i   know   that   is   work   for   me   or   not . i   would   never   ever   buy   anything   frome   discount   jungle .

wall   mount   is   handy   we   started   using   this   model   10   years   ago   it   s   so   much   better   than   putting   it   in   a   drawer   or   leaving   it   on   the   counter   all   the   time .   this   dryer   has   a   night   light   but   it   s   not   bright   enough   to   be   your   only   night   light   in   the   bathroom .   we   re   on   our   3rd   conair   wall   mount   dryer   all   the   same   model   .   the   first   one   lasted   about   5   years   it   s   actually   good   for   a   hair   dryer   that   gets   daily   use .   the   first   one   died   i   contributed   by   not   cleaning   it   enough   .   the   2nd   had   a   little   piece   of   plastic   that   broke   off   in   the   holder   when   you   put   the   hair   dryer   back   in   the   wall   mount ,   there   s   a   little   plastic   piece   that   holds   it   in   securely   and   that   piece   was   damaged .   2   lasted   about   4   years ,   so   not   too   bad   for   daily   use   the   dryer   was   fine ,   it   was   the   holder   .   hopefully   this   lasts   at   least   4   years   again .
beats   the   heck   out   of   rotary   hair   dryers   i   bought   this   for   my   wife   with   her   long , thick   hair   because   she   always   complained   about   how   her   rotary   style   hair   dryer   wasn   t   powerful   enough .   i   was   at   my   barbershop   and   noticed   this   was   the   model   my   barber   used   and   it   blew   strong   hot   air   so   i   decided   to   get   her   one   and   she   loves   it .
mounted   hairdryer   i   got   this   for   my   sister .   she   absolutely   loves   it .   she   does   a   lot   of   traveling   and   is   used   to   a   hairdryer   like   this .
exceptional   hair   dryer   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   as   a   christmas   present   for   my   girlfreind .   she   says   its   the   best   hair   dryer   she   has   ever   owned .   i   highly   recommend .
love   it !   my   husband   firefighter   had   a   nasty   habit   of   leaving   the   blowdryer   on   the   bathroom   counter   until   it   cooled   off .   everytime   i   walked   into   the   bathroom ,   there   d   be   the   clean   counter   with   the   blowdryer   sitting   on   it   so   i   d   wind   up   the   cord   and   put   it   in   the   cabinet .   everyday .   so   for   christmas ,   i   got   hubby   this   blowdryer   and   we   all   love   it .   colors   are   not   too   white ,   more   ivory   and   light   taupe ,   but   very   neutral .   the   kids   can   all   use   it   easily   5   yrs   and   up   ,   simple   on   off   button   on   the   base ,   hi   lo   on   the   dryer   handle   and   it   gets   put   away   right   away .   it   took   five   minutes   to   hang ,   we   plugged   it   right   into   the   outlet   and   i   love   it !
hairdryer   i   am   very   happy   with   this   dryer .   all   the   settings   and   attachments   let   me   do   almost   anything   with   my   hair .   i   have   a   bad   right   arm   and   can   t   use   curlers   so   this   really   helped   me   look   presentable !

cut   my   drying   time   in   half !   did   a   lot   of   research   on   blow   dryers   and   settled   on   this   one   based   on   positive   feedback .   totally   worth   the   money .   dried   my   hair   and   made   it   a   lot   straighter   than   my   old   dryer   and   only   took   half   the   time !
love   love   love   it ! ! ! !   i   ve   been   looking   for   a   dryer   for   quite   some   time   and   was   getting   close   to   ordering   a   200   dryer   but   just   couldn   t   see   actually   spending   that   on   a   hair   dryer   .   but   low   and   behold   i   took   a   chance   on   this   one   and   absolutely   love   it !   i   have   wavy   curly   hair   that   is   very   prone   to   frizziness   and   this   has   seemed   to   tame   some   of   that   chaos   and   makes   straightening   my   hair   really   easy .   it   has   cut   my   drying   time   down   by   a   few   minutes ,   is   quiet ,   and   throws   out   a   lot   of   air .   compared   to   my   last   hair   dryer   this   is   like   a   little   bit   of   heaven   in   the   morning !   i   would   definitely   recommend .   also ,   it   has   a   4   year   warranty   can   t   go   wrong   with   that !

good   price ,   good   features   maybe   like   you ,   i   had   a   huge   stylist   type   hairdryer   i   d   had   for   years .   after   moving   to   a   different   city   and   a   different   job ,   i   no   longer   needed   the   super   power   that   this   dryer   gave   me .   my   hair   does   better   air   dried   and   if   you   listen   to   all   the   stylists   in   the   media ,   they   say   blow   drying   your   hair   every   day   would   damage   it   so   a   quick   few   seconds   for   the   bangs   and   i   was   out   the   door .   with   the   limited   space   in   our   bathroom   after   moving ,   the   hair   dryer   took   up   more   space   than   was   warranted   for   it .   sure   i   wasn   t   spending   another   few   dollars   to   buy   something   i   already   had ,   but   the   frustration   of   never   having   a   clean   looking   sink   counter   had   been   eating   at   my   peace   of   mind .   after   a   few   trips   where   the   hotel   had   a   wall   mounted   hair   dryer   that   suited   my   need   just   fine ,   i   talked   the   hubby   into   putting   out   the   funds   for   a   wall   mounted   dryer .   i   hemmed   and   hawed   about   which   dryer   i   should   buy .   mostly ,   it   came   down   to   price   and   the   loop   for   the   cord .   didn   t   need   the   nightlight ,   but   after   a   couple   of   nights ,   the   soft   green   glow   came   in   handy   when   waking   up   in   the   middle   of   the   night   due   to   cats   or   a   need   to   use   the   toilet .   even   the   hubby   who   is   sensitive   to   light   at   night   was   comfortable   with   it   as   long   as   it   wasn   t   facing   the   bed .   the   loop   on   the   back   is   flat   and   not   a   circle   so   you   have   to   hook   the   cord   over   it   just   like   in   the   picture .   i   had   expected   it   to   be   a   full   circle   sticking   out   from   the   wall ,   but   it   sits   flush .   still ,   the   cord   does   stay   in   place   so   i   can   t   complain .   i   have   a   good   hair   dryer   and   it   s   finally   off   the   counter !
simple   to   set   up .   convenient   to   use .   okay ,   how   could   i   have   lived   63years   and   never   thought   of   installing   a   hair   dryer   on   the   wall   it   s   a   no   brainer !   dragging   out   the   hairdryer   every   day   and   trying   to   put   it   away   neatly   is   a   hassle   and   there   is   no   reason   to   put   up   with   it   any   longer !   i   bought   2   oster   76932   710   and   put   one   up   in   my   bathroom   and   the   other   in   the   spare   bath .   now   when   guests   come   over   they   compliment   me   for   the   nice   hotel   upgrade .   everybody   comments   on   what   a   good   idea .   the   710   watt   oster   is   a   great   dryer   and   does   the   job   well   on   my   thick   hair .   the   dryer   snaps   easily   in   and   out   of   the   holder .   it   took   me   about   30   minutes   to   install   both   dryers ... and   that   included   the   time   it   took   me   to   find   my   drill   and   try   and   read   3   16   on   the   drill   bit !   buy   this ... it   will   only   make   you   happy !
too   loud !   ion   damages   my   hair .   i   purchased   this   dryer   at   target   for   20 .   i   use   only   conair   dryers ,   and   know   that   it   is   a   matter   of   trying   until   i   find   the   right   one   for   me   when   the   old   one   dies .   this   one   is   so   loud   that   it   hurt   my   ears .   i   know   that   i   could   have   gotten   used   to   it ,   but   decided   that   it   was   best   not   to   try .   i   have   thick   and   fine   hair   and   for   some   reason   the   ion   dryer   really   zaps   my   hair   diminishes   the   shine .   this   dries   quickly   and   thoroughly ,   but   the   noise   and   damage   to   my   hair   are   not   worth   it .   i   will   go   back   to   a   regular   conair .   i   love   the   brand ,   but   just   not   this   item .
it   blew   a   circuit   .. !   none   available .
the   very   best   i   have   tried   a   lot   of   hair   dryers   in   the   last   40   years .   this   one   is ,   by   far ,   the   best   i   have   used .   it   is   pricier   than   the   ones   you   see   in   the   discount   stores ,   but   it   is   worth   every   penny   you   pay   for   it .   i   recommend   it   highly .
installation   installation   may   be   difficult   for   you   because   of   the   wall   anchors   that   come   with   the   hair   dryer .   they   spin   when   used ,   in   the   wall ,   and   will   not   grip ,   and   so   are   useless .   we   would   have   also   liked   to   see   robertson   head   screws   used ,   instead   of   phillips .   it   was   necessary   to   purchase   several   different   phillips   screwdrivers   to   grip   the   screws .   the   screws   were   over   tightened   in   the   base   at   the   factory   making   it   very   difficult   to   remove   them   for   use   in   attaching   the   hairdryer   to   the   base .
conair   225   the   dryer   is   heavier   than   expected ,   and   for   the   wattage ,   it   puts   out   less   air   than   it   should .
works   great   i   ve   had   mine   for   a   year   and   a   half ,   it   still   works   great .   turned   out   to   be   a   great   purchase .   br   3   17   2013   it   s   been   over   3   years   and   it   still   works   like   new .

like   it   but ....   yea   i   can   agree   with   everyone   s   review   about   how   it   is   heavier   than   most   dryers .   it   is   also   much   louder   too .   compared   to   my   old   dryer ,   it   sounds   like   somebody   s   going   through   my   house   with   damn   leaf   blower .   they   should   have   3   speeds   on   that   thing   because   it   doesn   t   just   sound   like   a   leaf   blower ,   it   feels   like   one   too .   the   low   on   this   dryer   is   my   old   dryers   high .   it   does   do   the   job   when   it   comes   to   getting   your   hair   dry   fast   though !  
alright   dryer   i   bought   this   dryer   becuase   i   needed   one   quick   and   it   was   cheap .   the   different   setting   selection   is   nice .   i   have   medium   thick   hair ,   and   a   lot   of   it ,   that   comes   down   to   between   my   shoulder   blades   and   normally   takes   me   about   30   minutes   to   dry .   it   did   the   job   for   about   a   year   till   it   shorted   out   and   sparks   came   out   of   it .   not   a   very   long   life ,   but   i   guess   you   get   what   you   pay   for .   i   have   had   other   revlon   hair   styling   tools   that   lasted   longer ,   just   not   this   one .
actually   works   better   than   i   thought .   but   price   still   seems   a   little   high ...   when   my   wife   first   said   she   wanted   me   to   get   her   this   for   her   birthday ,   i   though   she   had   lost   her   mind .   100   for   a   hair   dryer   ! ! ! ! ! ! !   well ,   gotta   keep   her   happy   so   i   got   it   for   her .   after   her   using   it   for   about   a   year ,   i   must   say   that   it   really   does   work   better   then   the   cheaper   hair   dryers   she   s   been   using .   her   hair   tends   to   get   frizzy   and   this   dryer   really   does   solve   that   problem   a   lot   better   the   25   hair   dryer   she   was   using   before .   it   seems   well   constructed .   make   sure   you   clean   out   the   filter   under   the   back   end   cap ! !   it   kept   stopping   every   5   8   minutes   my   wife   thought   it   was   overheating .   but   i   noticed   that   the   filter   was   clogged .   after   cleaning   it ,   the   hair   dryer   was   back   to   normal .   i   still   have   a   hard   time   with   paying   100   for   a   hair   dryer   but   i   must   say   that   it   actually   does   seem   to   work   better   than   normal   hair   dryers .
wallmount   dryer   this   is   our   second   unit   after   10   years   of   daily   service .   the   original   unit   worked   fine   until   the   internal   fan   that   pulls   air   through   the   unit   shattered .   we   mounted   a   2nd   unit   on   the   same   wall   bracket   in   about   5   seconds   and   are   again   happy   campers .
this   hair   dryer   is   the   boss   wife   wanted   good   hair   dryer .   i   know   nothing   about   them .   i   poked   around   on   the   internet   and   read   lots   of   reviews .   people   were   very   positive   about   this   brand   and   version .   it   is   a   professional   grade   high   quality   dryer   and   she   loves   it .   she   was   not   familiar   with   the   brand   previously .   the   only   thing   to   consider   and   not   a   big   deal   is   that   the   power   cord   is   longer   than   a   typical   home   cord   as   it   seems   to   true   that   this   is   used   by   professionals .   not   a   big   deal ,   but   so   you   know   it   does   not   have   a   little   curled   up   cord .
soft   hair   i   bought   this   for   my   daughter   and   am   very   pleased   with   my   purchase .   it   is   an   amazing   hair   dryer   that   literally   makes   your   hair   softer . i   would   recommend   this   to   anyone .
great   dryer   i   bought   this   as   a   gift   for   my   daughter   who   is   in   nursing   school .   she   loves   anything   that   is   pink   and   has   the   breast   cancer   logo .   she   said   this   is   the   best   dryer   she   has   ever   had , dries   her   hair   in   half   the   time .   she   said   she   loves   it , and   that   it   is   a   great   dryer .
cherry   red   cherry   product ! !   couldn   t   be   more   impressed   with   a   blow   dryer !   the   color   jumps   right   out   at   you   the   2   speeds   are   average   and   the   heat   options   work   great .   heats   up   really   fast   on   high   is   probably   too   hot   for   some .   have   medium   short   hair ,   so   no   need   for   attachments ,   but   i   m   sure   they   would   function   well   if   you   need   them .   can   t   say   enough   about   the   color   lol !
newer   isn   t   better   i   had   one   of   these   for   a   number   of   years   and   loved   it ,   however   the   new   one   i   just   purchased   broke   within   one   week .   the   holder   broke   and   now   its   hard   to   put   in   and   out   of   the   wall   mount .   another   piece   of   crap .
a   very   good   buy   this   is   the   only   hair   dryer   that   i   have   used   since   i   purchased   it .   it   has   a   powerful   motor ,   which   means   you   get   a   very   forceful   air   current .   it   pretty   quiet ,   and   this   dryer   can   put   out   alot   of   heat ,   so   sometimes   i   find   myself   turning   the   heat   setting   down   or   moving   it   further   from   my   head   because   it   can   get   uncomfortably   warm .   the   first   one   i   had   lasted   over   three   years ,   and   would   have   lasted   longer   if   i   had   been   a   little   less   clumsy   with   it .   to   be   honest ,   the   only   real   drawbacks   that   i   find   with   this   dryer   is   that   it   s   a   little   heavier   than   a   cheaper   hair   dryer ,   and   a   little   more   expensive ,   but   very   worth   it .
great   hairdryer !   i   just   got   this   hairdryer   a   few   days   ago   for   christmas ,   so   i   can   t   speak   for   it   s   longevity ,   but   i   love   it   already .   after   the   first   use ,   i   noticed   that   my   mid   back   length ,   thick   hair   was   less   frizzy ,   more   manageable   and   softer .   it   also   gets   dry   in   approximately   5   7   minutes ,   cutting   my   drying   time   in   half .   it   s   a   heavy   dryer ,   but   does   the   job   and   with   only   a   moderate   level   of   noise   on   high .   i   would   definitely   recommend   this   hair   dryer !
great !   this   is   very   good .   i   like   it .   i   can   select   strong ,   wild ,   hot   and   cool   style .   awesome !
a   great   product   this   is   a   very   good   product .   i   have   been   using   over   a   month .   it   has   enough   power   to   blow   your   hair   faster .   however ,   the   night   light   caused   everyone   a   little   uncomfortable .   the   light   was   too   bright   when   i   pluged   the   power .   the   only   way   to   turn   off   light   is   to   press   test   buttom   and   press   reset   buttom   when   you   needed   to   use ,   which   is   very   inconvenience .   so ,   i   opened   the   back   cover   and   stick   the   dark   tape   on   the   light   screen   to   reduce   the   bright   light .   i   wish   there   is   a   dimm   switch   to   adjust   light .
worth   every   penny   worth   evey   single   penny .   does   not   burn   hair .   would   order   another   one   in   a   minute   if   it   broke .   i   will   never   buy   another   cheap   blow   dryer   again .
honest   my   wife   and   i   have   used   this   product   for   at   least   10   years   every   day   and   it   finally   wore   out   so   i   had   to   buy   a   new   one .
hot   and   loud   i   ve   been   looking   for   a   new   dryer   with   a   soft   bonnet   after   my   last   vidal   sasson   dryer   broke .   this   dryer   gets   very   hot   on   the   middle   setting   but   doesn   t   dry   very   well .   the   low   setting   while   cooler   doesn   t   dry   your   hair .   i   thought   the   exessive   heat   would   make   your   hair   dry   in   half   the   time   but   it   doesn   t .   this   dryer   also   makes   loud   straining   noises ,   which   i   am   hoping   doesn   t   mean   the   motor   is   about   to   quit .   br   br   my   old   dryer   is   no   longer   being   manufactured   and   this   was   the   only   alternative   i   could   find .   what   can   you   do .
second   one   too !   burnout   both   times   this   week ,   our   second   andis   wall   mounted   dryer   burned   out .   after   our   first   failure ,   i   always   checked   and   cleaned   it   out   on   a   regular   basis .   prior   to   complete   unit   failure ,   the   internal   thermal   protection   would   turn   the   unit   off   prior   to   my   wife   finishing   her   hair .   it   would   typically   work   again   the   next   day .   the   first   one   lasted   about   3   month ,   the   second   one   about   8   months .   i   have   another   model   from   a   different   manufacturer   in   my   bath   and   it   has   worked   for   over   10   years .   we   purchased   this   one   because   of   the   claim   to   produce   less   noise   not   really   and   the   night   light .   the   night   light   could   be   too   bright   for   some ,   but   it   was   ok   for   us .   i   just   order   another   wall   mount   from   a   different   manufacturer .   in   less   than   1   year ,   i   will   be   120   for   one   hair   dryer .   not   good   value .   plus ,   i   am   sure   i   ll   have   to   make   new   mounting   holes   and ,   patch   and   repaint   over   the   old   ones .
fastest   blow   dryer   ever !   i   have   very   long ,   thick   blonde   hair .   usually   i   don   t   have   the   patience   to   blow   dry   my   hair .   i   have   been   using   the   same   hot   pink   conair   blow   dryer   for   about   3   years   and   it   takes   at   least   20   mins   to   get   my   hair   completely   dry .   i   used   this   andis   product   at   a   hotel   i   stayed   in   in   nyc   and   loved   it !   it   dried   my   hair   in   less   than   10   minutes .   i   wrote   down   the   brand   name   of   the   blow   dryer   and   bought   it   on   amazon . com   the   day   i   got   home   from   my   trip .   br   i   have   already   recommended   it   to   all   of   my   girlfriends !
cool !   used   it   for   about   a   year   now ,   have   had   no   problems !   it   was   easy   to   install   and   works   great !   keeps   counter   clear   and   is   ready   to   use .
quiet   and   smooth   i   love   this   hair   dryer !   on   vacation   i   used   my   sisters   was   so   impressed   that   once   i   got   home ,   i   went   online   ordered   it .   this   hair   dryer   is   the   best   i   ve   ever   bought ,   and   i   ve   had   plenty   over   the   years .   most   hair   dryers   have   a   high   pitched   whine   when   on   high .   this   one   is   very   quiet ,   almost   whooshing   it   dry .   also ,   my   hair   is   smoother   than   it   s   ever   been   after   being   dried .   could   it   really   be   the   fact   it   is   tourmaline   or   ceramic   no   matter ,   i   would   highly   recommend   this   brand   and   this   model !   buying   it   through   amazon   made   it   much   easier   since   i   didn   t   want   to   go   through   the   hassle   of   looking   for   it ,   not   knowing   which   stores   carried   this   exact   model .   price   was   very   competitive .
love ,   love   love   this   blowdryer !   i   tried   this   blowdryer   at   kimpton   hotels   in   san   francisco   forgive   me   it   blew   mind ! ! ! !   i   have   long   curly   hair   that   i   straighten   as   i   blowdry   using   a   large   metal   brush .   normally ,   this   is   a   20   30   minute   painstakingly   long   process .   this   blowdryer   reduced   my   drying   time   to   7   minutes ! !   7   minutes ! ! ! !   the   hot   air   is   very   hot ,   the   high   speed   is   very   high .   i   loved   this   product   so   much   i   texted   myself   the   name   of   it   and   bought   it   when   i   got   home .   can   t   say   enough ...   it   does   overheat ,   so   if   you   turn   it   off   between   sections   of   hair   or   something ...   you   might   have   to   wait   until   it   cools   a   little .   but   to   save   15   20   minutes   of   my   life   from   blowdrying   hell ,   it   s   worth   it ! !
not   quite   what   i   wanted   but   a   good   dryer   i   guess   i   wasn   t   reading   the   description   quite   right   when   i   ordered   this   dryer ,   i   was   hoping   it   had   2   levels   of   power   plus   3   temps .   but   at   low   temp   the   dryer   blows   less   air ,   and   at   high   temp   it   blasts   my   hair   making   it   hard   to   style .   so   i   just   use   the   medium   setting   medium   heat   medium   air   flow .   i   do   really   like   the   folding   feature   and   retractable   cord .   they   make   it   so   much   easier   to   store   in   a   bathroom   vanity   drawer .   it   is   not   lightweight   so   don   t   buy   it   if   you   are   looking   for   a   lightweight   travel   dryer .   it   s   more   of   a   space   saver   in   the   bathroom   rather   than   the   suitcase !   i   do   like   the   andis   brand ,   not   sure   if   i   would   buy   this   particular   one   again   because   of   the   temp   air   flow   issue ,   but   it   is   definitely   well   made   and   worth   the   money .
don   t   buy   it   from   amazon   don   t   buy   it   from   amazon ,   it   arrived   on   time   buy   it   had   scratches   and   looked   used .
love   this   blow   dryer !   i   have   two   teenage   girl   s   and   we   have   really   put   this   blow   dryer   through   the   test .   it   works   great   and   dries   our   hair   quickly   without   the   frizz .   would   highly   recommend !
does   the   job   i   like   this   product .   the   chord   is   long   enough .   noise   level   is   not   too   loud .   two   power   levels .   the   only   reason   i   only   gave   it   three   stars   is   because   i   don   t   know   if   it   s   going   to   last .
stopped   working   after   10   months   worked   great .   love   the   retractable   cord .   then   one   day ,   just   10   months   after   buying   it ,   it   just   wouldn   t   turn   on .   i   had   to   throw   it   in   the   trash .   my   last   hair   dryer   lasted   years   and   years .   this   sucks .
not   authentic   first ,   i   was   very   much   unimpressed   by   this   hair   dryer .   given   its   price ,   i   was   expecting   something   significantly   better   than   a   20   dollar   dryer   none .   and   it   s   no   featherweight ,   it   s   heavier   than   my   previous   one .   second ,   i   found   that   i   couldn   t   register   this   product   because   its   lack   of   the   serial   number .   though   on   the   manual ,   it   specifically   says   if   the   serial   number   is   missing ,   it   might   not   be   authentic .   so   here   goes   the   warranty   comes   with   the   bespoke   itself .   but   i   reasoned   it   must   still   be   authentic   since   it   s   sold   by   amazon ..   third ,   i   went   to   sephora   and   found   this   one   on   shelf .   man ,   the   one   in   sephora ,   though   looked   exactly   like   this   one   i   had ,   but   it   s   real   featherweighted   just   by   this ,   i   didn   t   even   need   to   try   out   the   functionality   of   that   one   in   sephora   to   understand   i   have   got   this   fake   one   from   amazon .   amazon   tried   to   charge   me   restocking   fee   for   this   one   that   is   fake .   i   need   a   resolution ! !   please   don   t   buy ,   it   s   fake .
good   for   the   proce   our   last   andis   lasted   3   1   2   years   and   i   think   that   is   pretty   good   for   a   much   used   hair   dryer .   i   love   the   wall   mount   and   i   even   like   the   night   light .   i   highly   recommend   this   dryer   to   anyone .
love   it   i   looked   in   the   usual   stores   to   replace   my   other   oster   wall   mounted   hair   dryer   we   ve   had   for   about   10yrs   and   could   not   find   this   item .   we   all   love   the   convenience   of   not   having   to   store   it   anywhere   and   always   have   it   handy   next   to   the   vanity   where   it   is   needed .   it   is   a   great   product   besides .   i   definitely   will   re   order   this   again .
plug   prongs   overheating   beware   i   ve   had   the   conair   ion   shine   1875   for   about   6   months   and   haven   t   been   particularly   unhappy   with   the   dryer .   i   wouldn   t   even   be   writing   a   review   if   i   hadn   t   burned   my   fingers   on   the   plug   this   morning .   i   have   very   thin ,   fine   hair   and   don   t   need   to   use   the   blow   dryer   more   than   3   minutes   in   order   to   dry   my   hair .   there   s   absolutely   no   reason   for   the   prongs   on   the   plug   to   heat   to   the   point   that   they   become   a   branding   iron .   i   let   the   plug   cool   down   and   checked   it   in   another   outlet   to   be   sure   the   problem   lay   in   the   dryer   and   not   in   the   electrical   outlet ,   and   the   prongs   heated   to   the   point   of   burning   in   under   a   minute .   needless   to   say ,   the   dryer   went   straight   in   the   trash .   after   the   plug   cooled   down .   i   ll   be   saving   my   receipt   for   the   next   dryer   which   won   t   be   a   conair   that   i   purchase .
great   value   for   the   price   t3   bespoke   labs   evolution   hair   dryer   superfast   shipping .   item   arrived   in   new   condition   as   described .   very   nice   hair   dryer .   very   powerful .   i   was   a   bit   concern   about   the   life   of   this   product   but   so   far   so   good ...
great   while   it   lasted   i   loved   this ... while   it   lasted .   after   3   weeks ,   it   stopped   working .   i   also   was   not   able   to   register   it   with   the   manufacturer   and   receive   warranty   coverage   because   amazon   is   not   a   registered   dealer .   the   seller   has   agreed   to   replace   it   when   i   mail   the   product   back .   just   be   aware   of   these   potential   issues .
fast   drying   normally   it   takes   me   1   2   hour   to   dry   my   long   hair ,   but   now   only   15   minuites   with   this   fhi   2000   hair   dryer .   also ,   my   hair   is   silky   to   the   touch   afterward .   the   weigh   of   this   dryer   i   feel   a   little   bit   heavy   at   first ,   but   it   s   solid .   i   bought   this   dryer   in   pink   color   before ,   and   this   black   one   is   for   my   sister   as   x   mas   gift .   i   hope   she   will   like   it   as   much   as   i   do .   great   service   from   amazon .   fast   delivery   about   a   week .   nice   packaging   no   damage   at   all .   thank   you !
great   travel   dryer   at   a   great   price   i   bought   this   dryer   about   a   month   ago   exclusively   for   travel ,   but   i   like   it   so   well   that   i   ve   been   using   it   for   my   regular   one .   i   like   that   the   retractable   cord   keeps   my   counter   looking   uncluttered ,   but   it   doesn   t   always   retract   as   easily   as   it   should .   i   sometimes   have   to   coax   the   cord   back   in   the   handle ,   but   to   me ,   it   s   a   tolerable   hassle   especially   for   the   price   point   .   the   dryer   is   very   powerful .   i   have   a   ton   of   hair   and   the   wattage   really   minimizes   the   time   it   takes   me   to   get   my   hair   dry .   the   ceramic   element   also   minimizes   the   static   i   experience   with   most   other   hair   dryers .   overall ,   it   has   a   few   flaws ,   but   for   19.99   it   s   a   heck   of   a   dryer .   br   br   update   i   have   had   this   over   a   year   now   and   it   s   still   going   strong   after   daily   use .   love   this   thing !
t3   featherweight   hair   dryer   this   was   definitely   worth   the   purchase !   it   dries   faster   than   normal   hair   dryers .   best   of   all ,   i   have   had   a   ton   of   compliments   on   how   shiny   my   hair   is   since   i   started   using   it !
just   what   i   needed   update   posted   12   2012   this   was   my   2nd   attempt   at   a   wall   mounted   hair   dryer .   the   first   one   was   terrible .   the   one   i   got   rid   of   had   a   short   barrel   and   sucked   my   hair   into   the   intake   in   the   back   and   ended   up   burning   up   the   3rd   time   i   used   it .   i   ve   had   this   one   a   little   over   a   month   and   it   is   so   much   better .   easy   to   mount .   easy   to   use .   i   love   that   it   turns   off   when   you   set   it   back   in   the   cradle .   cord   gives   enough   to   stretch   down   low   when   i   blow   dry   my   daughters   hair .   only   negative   is   that   there   is   no   heat   control .   high   air   setting   has   high   heat .   medium   air   has   medium   heat .   low   air   has   luke   warm   heat .   but   since   i   prefer   the   high   air   high   heat   it   works   ok   for   me .   i   recommend   it .   br   br   update12   2012   around   the   beginning   of   2012   the   unit   s   high   setting   stopped   working .   or   rather   it   works   intermittently .   sometimes   it   will   come   on   but   most   times   it   does   not .   this   makes   it   hard   to   dry   thick   or   long   hair .   the   heat   air   volume   on   the   other   settings   doesn   t   cut   it   if   you   want   to   dry   your   hair   quickly   or   if   you   have   a   lot   of   hair .   still   pretty   good   product   in   terms   of   size   design   price   and   maybe   i   m   expecting   too   long   a   life   from   a   hair   dryer ,   but   i   do   know   that   most   of   the   others   dryers   i   ve   owned   lasted   6   8   years .   was   hoping   at   least   that   much   out   of   this   one .
great   dryer !   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   to   replace   my   previous   hot   tools   hair   dryer   that   had   broken   after   many   years   of   use .   this   hair   dryer   is   even   better   than   my   old   one !   it   is   much   lighter   and   still   has   the   same   fast   drying   power   of   the   last   one .   i   take   it   everywhere   because   no   other   hair   dryer   can   dry   my   long   layered   hair   as   quickly   and   easily .
great   product .   this   is   a   great   product ,   if   it   can   be   quieter   and   smaller .   it   will   be   an   even   better   item   for   home   users .
do   one   thing   and   do   it   well   i   replaced   a   conair   1600   which   was   used   daily   for   several   years   and   finally   died .   i   bought   this   based   on   the   numerous   good   amazon   reviews   and   because   some   have   said   that   the   1850   watt   dryers   might   not   work   outside   the   u . s .   delivery   was   swift .   the   dryer   feels   substantial   and   well   built .   it   dries   more   quickly   than   the   old   conair   without   hair   looking   like   i   stuck   my   finger   in   a   socket .   as   was   mentioned   before ,   this   will   dry   anything   short   of   a   wookie   very   quickly .   highly   recommended .   10   19   10   just   received   a   second   andis   33805   ordered   6   days   ago   as   backup   in   the   event   this   model   33805   is   discontinued .   the   original   has   performed   flawlessly   and   continues   to   feel   well   built .
perfect   little   travel   hair   dryer .   dual   voltage   perfect   for   travel .   wonderful   size   and   perfect   heat ... not   too   hot   as   some   can   be .   i   make   my   daughter   bring   this   one   when   we   travel   since   i   love   it   so   much   and   i   leave   mine   old   clunky   one   at   home .
bummer   i   m   sure   this   hair   dryer   could   have   been   great .   i   loved   my   yellowbird   but   unfortunately ,   this   blackbird   would   not   power   on .   the   original   hair   dryer   got   to   me   in   a   matter   of   days   but   the   replacement   was   going   to   weeks   so   i   had   to   cancel   it   and   get   a   refund .   bummer !
quit   working   after   two   uses   i   bought   this   dryer   strictly   to   use   for   deep   conditioning   my   hair   after   reading   the   reviews   that   it   didn   t   work   well   for   drying   hair .   it   worked   beautifully   for   this   the   first   two   times   i   used   it ,   i   just   hooked   it   up   to   use   for   the   third   time   and   it   worked   for   about   15   seconds   i   started   on   the   cool   setting   then   shut   off ... i   tried   other   outlets   in   case   that   was   the   issue .   it   is   a   dead   dryer .   i   m   very   disappointed   in   this   product .
thanks ,   jen !   i   also   first   tried   this   product   while   on   vacation .   this   little   hair   dryer   is   compact ,   light ,   and   powerful .   the   best   part ,   however ,   is   the   service   i   got   from   this   vendor !   my   order   was   filled   right   away ,   i   got   it   within   days ,   and   the   price   was   the   best   i   found   by   far .   thanks ,   jen !   anita   stratford ,   ct
warning !   from   the   start   i   wasn   t   totally   happy   with   this   hair   drier ,   but   decided   to   make   do   anyway .   too   much   hassle   to   return   it .   the   toggle   switch   was   difficult   to   use   and   when   i   wanted   curls   in   my   hair ,   for   some   reason   i   couldn   t   make   it   work   as   well   with   this   one .   do   the   ion   driers   straighten   the   hair   the   higher   speed   temperature   is   too   hot ,   but   the   lower   one   takes   too   long   to   dry   my   hair .   the   worst   of   it   started   about   two   months   ago   when   it   started   slowing   down   after   a   minute   or   so   of   use .   i   didn   t   think   much   about   it   other   than   realizing   i   d   probably   need   to   replace   it   soon .   then   this   morning   as   i   was   drying   my   hair ,   i   happened   to   see   it   in   the   mirror   as   it   slowed   down .   it   was   throwing   sparks   when   it   slowed !   i   was   lucky   my   hair   hadn   t   caught   fire !   needless   to   say   it   has   been   discarded ,   and   today   thanksgiving   day   i   have   one   more   thing   for   which   to   be   thankful   i   was   protected   from   a   fire .
great   product   !   this   is   the   second   unit   i   ve   puchased   like   this ,   was   very   pleased   with   the   first   one .   very   handy ,   no   worries   about   plugging   it   in   since   it   s   hard   wired   to   begin   with .   the   first   unit   is   about   five   yrs   old   now   with   perfect   performance ...   tops   st .   louis
after   using   it   for   about   a   year   and   i   noticed   i   lost   my   natural   shine   i   agree   with   another   user   seemed   to   work   ok   at   first   although   i   didn   t   notice   much   improvment   in   speed   of   drying .   it   is   lightweight   and   easy   to   handle   but   it   is   hotter   than   i   m   used   to .   after   6   months ,   my   hair   started   to   feel   dry   and   had   zero   shine .   my   hair   had   always   been   very   healthy   and   shiny   before .   my   hair   stylist   noticed   it   and   couldn   t   figure   out   what   was   wrong .   after   about   9   months ,   i   switched   back   to   my   old   hairdryer   and   my   hair   was   instantly   healthy   and   shiny   again .   maybe   this   hairdryer   is   good   for   some   people   but   it   was   bad   for   me ,   and   costly !   this   comment   above   sums   it   up   for   me   as   well .   in   the   beginning   you   notice   the   shine   which   was   great   but   after   a   few   months   i   started   to   notice   that   my   hair   was   losing   it   s   shine   and   bounce .   i   now   went   back   to   my   old   blow   dryer   that   i   had   in   storage   and   my   hair   is   bouncy   again   and   the   shine   is   coming   back   slowly   but   surely .   i   believe   this   blow   dryer   doesn   t   work   for   all   hair   types .   my   hair   is   semi   curly .   darlene
happy   with   my   purchase   i   have   very   thick ,   very   curly   hair   that   is   below   my   shoulders   and   this   dryer   works   great .   i   diffuse   my   hair   and   my   only   complaint   is   that   the   nozzle   on   the   dryer   is   a   little   big   and   is   a   tight   fit   for   the   largest   connector   to   my   helen   of   troy   diffuser .   it   is   a   little   heavy ,   but   i   don   t   hold   the   dryer   above   my   head   when   i   dry   my   hair ... if   i   did ,   they   weight   of   the   dryer   would   probably   be   a   little   bothersome .   the   hot   setting   on   the   dryer   gets   really   hot   which   i   like ,   and   the   cool   shot   button   gets   the   dryer   as   cool   as   possible   reasonably   fast .   after   trying   and   returning   other   dryers ,   i   m   happy   with   this   one .   it   s   not   too   expensive   and   it   works   great   for   me .   i   ve   only   had   it   about   a   week ,   and   some   other   reviews   said   it   stopped   working   after   a   few   months ,   so   we   ll   see .
not   as   powerful   as   i   thought   it   would   be   a   fairly   good   hairdryer   although   not   very   powerful   but   adequate   for   my   purposes .   the   first   one   i   received   didn   t   work   at   all   and   had   to   be   returned .   this   one   works   fine ,   but   was   a   little   difficult   to   install .   i   love   the   night   light   it   is   very   bright ,   but   one   can   always   close   the   bathroom   door   if   it   s   bothersome .   i   would   purchase   this   item   again .
sent   wrong   product   picture   is   incorrect   i   ordered   the   product   pictured   andis   1600w   wall   mount   hair   dryer   to   replace   a   similar   unit   that   i   have   been   very   happy   with .   i   was   sent   a   different   product   that   does   not   match   the   pictured   product   and   has   multiple   cords   protruding   from   the   base   and   is   unusable   to   me .   amazon   s   rules   are   that   it   has   to   be   returned   unopened   and   i   ripped   the   packaging   before   i   realized   the   wrong   product   was   sent .   i   will   not   be   ordering   from   amazon   again .
disappointed   andis   purchaser   after   3   1   2   months   after   purchasing   this   hair   dryer ,   the   unit   has   burned   out .   this   was   not   the   first   time   i   have   experienced   this   same   problem   with   this   same   dryer .   a   year   ago   i   purchased   the   same   dryer   and   the   had   the   same   problem .   would   i   ever   buy   another   andis   product ... no !
excellent   dryer !   this   is   an   excellent   blow   dryer !   i   read   the   reviews   before   purchasing   about   how   it   didn   t   work   right   out   of   the   box .   same   thing   happened   to   me ,   except   that   i   realized   that   if   you   press   the   red   reset   button   on   the   plug ,   it   works   just   fine .   my   hair   dries   faster ,   without   over   drying .   great   price ,   too !
oster   wall   mount   hair   dryer   the   dryer   works   like   a   charm   and   is   just   what   we   were   looking   for .   i   d   recommend   it   for   anyone   who   doesn   t   want   a   hair   dryer   just   lying   around   on   their   countertop .
great   hairdryer   i   had   one   before   and   was   lost   without   it .   ordinary   blow   dryers   take   longer   and   don   t   make   my   hair   look   as   healthy .   i   could   not   wait   for   my   replacement   to   come .
the   bird   is   the   word !   i   have   natural ,   color   treated ,   kinky   curly ,   african   american   hair .   a   co   worker   recommended   it   for   blow   outs .   she   s   used   it   for   3   years   twice   a   week ,   with   no   replacements   .   i   ve   had   the   yellow   bird   for   4   months ,   and   i   have   no   complaints .   it   has   reduced   my   drying   time   in   half ,   i   love   the   four   different   heat   settings   cold   setting   at   the   end   for   shine   ,   and   most   importantly   the   comb   is   nice   and   strong !   i   purchased   it   at   a   beauty   supply   store   but   i   just   had   to   come   on   here   and   sing   this   bird   s   praises !   i   am   such   a   fan !   br   br   3   23   10   i   stilll   looooooove   the   yellow   bird !   i   use   it   once   a   week   for   my   hair   and   it   s   still   going   strong .   no   problems   whatsoever !   i   ve   recommended   this   dryer   to   about   5   others ,   they   ve   all   bought   it   and   they   love   it   also .   br   br   3   5   13   my   yellowbird   is   still   going   strong .   i   use   it   less   on   my   hair   1   2   times   a   month   ,   but   it   s   still   effective .   the   only   complaint   is   that   i   can   t   order   a   replacement   comb   i   dropped   the   whole   unit   by   mistake   and   2   teeth   came   off   on   one   end .   i   still   use   the   comb ,   i   just   divide   my   hair   in   smaller   sections   so   that   my   hair   doesn   t   pass   through   the   end   with   the   broken   teeth .
universal   hair   dryer   i   bought   this   for   my   wife   just   before   a   trip   to   greece .   it   worked   flawlessly   both   here   and   there .   she   combined   it   with   a   universal   plug   system   from   aaa   and   found   no   flaws   on   either   in   the   us   or   in   europe .
a   better   hair   dryer   my   first   expensive   hair   dryer .   it   really   does   dry   faster ,   leaves   my   hair   in   better   shape ,   and   is   amazingly   quiet .
good   product ,   a   bit   pricey   asin   b0017wnhyg   turbo   power   twin   turbo   2600   hair   dryer   i   bought   this   for   my   mom   s   beauty   salon   she   had   some   of   these   but   they   were   worn   out ,   so   basically   she   knew   what   to   expect   from   this   product .   although   it   was   a   good   buy ,   it   wasn   t   exactly   a   bargain   as   the   price   was   not   very   far   from   what   i   could   get   on   a   brick   and   mortar   store .   as   of   know   it   has   been   what   expected   reliable ,   and   comfortable   in   hand .   i   my   mom   would   recommend   this   product .
too   much   power   this   hair   dryer   does   leave   my   hair   soft ,   but   it   s   air   flow   is   much   too   strong   for   styling   my   shoulder   length   hair ,   even   on   the   low   setting .   since   air   flow   control   was   the   primary   reason   for   selecting   this   particular   item ,   i   am   disappointed   and   use   the   dryer   only   occasionally .
alot   of   power !   the   hairdryer   fits   exactly   on   the   wall   mount   that   we   installed   for   our   sears   hair   dryer .   this   hair   dryer   has   more   watts ,   so   more   power .   my   hair   gets   dryer   much   quicker .   a   very   good   product   and   can   t   beat   the   price .   i   was   searching   this   product   and   this   price   was   the   cheapest .
absolutely   first   class   i   was   give   my   first   jerson   first   class   hair   dryer   over   10   years   ago .   as   soon   as   i   realized   it   didn   t   have   much   life   left ,   i   purchased   another .   this   one   is   working   just   as   well   and   perhaps   it   will   also   last   10   years .   as   long   as   the   company   makes   this   model ,   that   is   the   only   brand   i   will   ever   buy .
just   as   good   the   second   time   around   this   is   my   second   209r .   when   my   first   one   finally   expired   after   around   five   years   of   daily   use ,   i   knew   that   i   wanted   another   just   like   it .   this   dryer   is   wondefully   efficient ,   lightweight   and   has   the   cord   keeper   feature   that   makes   it   very   easy   to   store .   very   highly   recommended .
great   value !   i   like   the   design   of   the   jerdon   wall   mount   hair   dryer .   it   s   compact   and   easy   to   install   on   the   wall .   the   double   buttons   make   it   easy   to   use ,   too .   the   cons   the   dryer   doesn   t   have   a   cool   setting ,   only   high ,   med ,   and   low ,   plus   the   electrical   cord   is   very   short   and   you   must   install   it   very   close   to   the   outlet .
mounted   hair   dryer   good   product ,   very   easy   to   install .   don   t   use   the   screw   provided   instead   by   special   drywall   screws   otherwise   we   are   very   happy   with   this   product .
more   than   you   expact   good   price ... it   doesn   t   get   too   hot   to   damage   your   hair ... super   fast   drying   capacity ...   br   i   didn   t   know   changing   the   hair   dryer   makes   your   life   this   much   easier .
lightweight   and   powerful   i   tried   this   hair   dryer   at   a   hotel   and   loved   the   fact   that   it   was   lightweight   yet   powerful .   i   have   problems   with   my   arms   and   this   allowed   me   to   dry   my   hair   without   the   added   weight   of   those   other   hair   dryers .   i   loved   it   so   much ,   i   bought   2 !
better   than   the   big   girl   very   powerful   on   high   setting .   needs   a   middle   setting   though .   rocker   switch   very   hard   to   move   accurately   from   one   setting   to   another ,   but   maybe   that   will   improve   with   use .   shot   of   cool   air   feature   is   helpful   and   hair   dries   quickly   with   smooth   finish .   i   rarely   use   my   full   sized   chi   dryer   as   the   size ,   power   and   weight   make   this   my   go   to   dryer .   that   said ,   i   haven   t   used   this   for   international   travel   so   cannot   vouch   for   other   features .   overall   a   great   value   for   the   price !
hair   dryer   the   dryer   was   exactly   as   advertised   and   i   am   extremely   satisfied   with   the   hair   dryer   it   was   shipped   without   delay .
this   dryer   is   just   ok   ...   while   it   is   extremely   lightweight   and   the   long   cord   is   great ,   i   ve   had   better   dryers   and   regret   this   purchase .   i   agree   that   this   dryer   is   effective   in   cutting   down   the   time   it   takes   to   dry   thick   hair   it   does   not ,   however ,   have   enough   heat   to   straighten   and   smooth   my   thick   yet   fine   textured   wavy   hair   without   using   a   flat   iron .   it   leaves   my   hair   straight ,   but   a   little   on   the   frizzy   bushy   side   in   comparison   to   other   dryers   i   ve   owned   in   the   past .   i   hate   the   way   my   hair   looks   when   i   use   it   alone   and   now   need   to   spend   more   money   on   something   better .
great   features ,   but   a   couple   issues   out   of   the   box ,   this   dryer   certainly   comes   with   all   of   the   essential   requirements   that   i   look   for   in   a   hair   dryer .   i   won   t   buy   a   dryer   without   high   med   low   heat   and   high   low   speed   which   this   one   has ,   because   i   do   my   hair   both   curly   and   straight .   i   like   that   it   comes   with   a   concentrator   and   diffuser ,   because   it   is   sometimes   hard   to   fit   aftermarket   attachments .   the   filter   is   easy   to   remove   and   clean   it   also   isn   t   too   heavy .   the   color   is   cute ,   although   i   don   t   know   if   most   men   would   like   it .   br   br   on   using   it ,   it   has   good   power ,   and   it   s   not   too   noisy .   it   also   doesn   t   get   hot   anywhere   but   on   the   very   tip   by   the   metal   grate ,   and   even   that   s   not   bad .   if   you   are   a   stylist   who   likes   to   hold   the   barrel   of   the   dryer ,   this   is   totally   doable .   and   it   s   cool   enough   to   put   away   immediately   after   use   instead   of   leaving   it   to   cool ,   which   is   especially   nice .   the   cord   is   a   good   length .   br   br   the   retractable   cord   is   definitely   a   nice   feature ,   but   should   be   done   two   handed ,   guiding   the   cord   so   it   doesn   t   come   up   and   hit   your   hand   or   arm   i   tried   it ,   ouch !   .   it   s   a   tad   tricky   because   the   button   is   small   and   slightly   awkward   to   get   to   one   handed .   br   br   all   that   said ,   i   have   two   issues   with   this   product .   the   first   is   minor ...   there   is   no   loop   or   hook   to   hang   the   thing   up !   i   keep   my   dryer   on   a   hook   inside   the   door   or   my   bathroom   vanity   cabinet ,   and   it   s   an   annoyance   that   i   can   t   hang   this   there .   and   because   the   cord   is   retractable ,   you   can   t   really   loop   it   around   the   barrel   and   hang   it   with   that   without   negating   that   feature .   br   br   the   second   issue   is   more   significant .   i   am   no   engineer ,   but   in   my   lay   opinion ,   this   dryer   has   way   too   much   vibration .   it   gives   my   hand   a   bit   of   a   workout   while   holding   it .   i   can   t   say   whether   this   is   a   problem   will   this   model ,   or   just   for   some   reason   the   one   that   i   was   sent .   but   it   is   significant ,   and   it   is   still   happening   after   10   or   so   uses .   br   br   this   dryer   is   nice ,   but   without   understanding   specifically   the   benefits   of   ionic ,   tourmaline   etc . ,   i   don   t   see   anything   that   makes   it   better   than   any   other   dryer   with   those   same   essential   features   i   mentioned   at   the   beginning .   personally ,   i   d   rather   have   one   with   a   hanging   loop . e   anything   that   makes   it   better   than   any   other   dryer   with   those   same   essential   features   i   mentioned   at   the   beginning .   personally ,   i   d   rather   have   one   with   a   hanging   loop .
good   but   not   wow   i   ve   been   using   this   hair   dryer   for   over   3   months   now .   i   wanted   to   wait   to   give   any   reviews   till   i   used   this   for   awhile   and   i   must   say   that   it   hasn   t   scored   any   points   for   length   of   use .   i   thought   maybe   if   i   continued   to   use   it ,   my   hair   would   improve   from   being   dry ,   but   it   hasn   t .   br   br   this   dryer   has   a   low   and   high   speed   setting ,   and   low ,   medium   and   hot   heat   settings .   the   low   setting   dryed   my   hair   as   fast   as   a   cheaper   dryer   and   the   high   speed   setting   is   probably   enough   to   even   dry   clothes   rather   quickly !   it   packs   a   punch !   after   using   all   three   heat   settings ,   i   found   that   medium   works   best   although   hot   doesn   t   get   as   hot   as   most   other   dryers   i   ve   tried   and   those   tend   to   actually   burn   the   hair .   there   s   also   a   cool   shot   feature   that   works   great   if   you   re   using   the   hot   setting   and   want   an   instant   cool   down .   br   br   the   attachments   are   an   airflow   diffuser   and   an   airflow   concentrator .   both   of   these   work   well   if   you   either   want   a   wide   spread   airflow   or   a   concentrated   one .   the   concentrated   one   works   good   if   you   re   using   either   a   brush   or   curlers   and   want   the   air   concentrated   on   that   particular   spot .   the   wide   spread   one   is   simply   if   you   want   a   wider   area   of   airflow ,   such   as   if   you   have   really   long   hair .   br   br   i   thought   that   the   tourmaline   feature   would   make   it   somehow   better   for   my   hair ,   but   i   haven   t   noticed   any   improvement   over   other   standard   and   less   expensive   hair   dryers .   this   is   my   biggest   dissapointment   with   this   one   and   why   i   waited   over   3   months   to   submit   a   review .   br   br   on   the   plus   side ,   the   filter   hasn   t   clogged   yet   or   gotten   any   hair   in   it   at   all !   this   is   amazing ,   since   with   other   dryers   i   ve   used ,   it   didn   t   take   long   at   all   before   hair   would   start   gathering   in   the   filter .   this   one   also   has   a   removable   filter ,   but   as   of   yet   i   haven   t   needed   to   clean   it .   br   br   this   is   also   heavier   than   most   dryers ,   so   if   you   have   weak   arms   or   otherwise   have   trouble   holding   something   rather   heavy   for   the   length   of   time   that   it   would   take   to   dry   your   hair ,   this   one   probably   isn   t   for   you .   however ,   if   you   want   to   do   something   a   little   extra   to   help   build   muscle   in   your   arms ,   this   will   do   it !   it   weighs   under   a   pound ,   but   compared   to   other   dryers ,   it   weighs   about   1   3   more   on   average .   this   is   also   quieter   than   most   dryers   i   ve   used .   more   time   will   tell   on   how   durable   it   is ,   but   the   way   this   is   constructed ,   i   have   no   doubts   that   it   will   last   a   long   time .   br   br   i   m   giving   this   3   stars   due   to   the   good   features   it   has ,   but   for   the   cost   of   the   money   and   the   seemingly   better   for   your   hair   impressions   that   it   seems   it   should   have ,   it   didn   t   score   there .   it   remains   just   above   average . you .   however ,   if   you   want   to   do   something   a   little   extra   to   help   build   muscle   in   your   arms ,   this   will   do   it !   it   weighs   under   a   pound ,   but   compared   to   other   dryers ,   it   weighs   about   1   3   more   on   average .   this   is   also   quieter   than   most   dryers   i   ve   used .   more   time   will   tell   on   how   durable   it   is ,   but   the   way   this   is   constructed ,   i   have   no   doubts   that   it   will   last   a   long   time .   i   m   giving   this   3   stars   due   to   the   good   features   it   has ,   but   for   the   cost   of   the   money   and   the   seemingly   better   for   your   hair   impressions   that   it   seems   it   should   have ,   it   didn   t   score   there .   it   remains   just   above   average .
love   it !   i   have   thick   hair   and   it   dries   it   in   a   fraction   of   the   time   of   other   dryers .   heavy   but   doesn   t   bother   me   esp .   since   i   don   t   have   to   hold   it   as   long   as   others .
convenient   wall   mounted   dryer   until   it   failed   catastrophically   this   model   was   installed   by   our   contractor   and   served   well   for   several   years ,   until   one   day   its   innards   flew   apart   nobody   was   hurt   so   we   bought   a   replacement .   the   wall   mount   is   very   convenient .   because   we   installed   it   low   on   a   cabinet   and   the   cord   is   a   bit   short ,   we   hung   it   upside   down   i . e .   cord   on   top   ,   which   requires   the   fifth   optional   screw   through   the   hole   in   the   magnet   otherwise   it   would   slip   right   off   the   wall   mount   .   power   is   adequate   for   me .
horrible   hair   dryer   i   purchased   this   hair   dryer   for   200   with   the   t3   volumizing   lotion   and   orlando   pita   styling   brush .   i   have   never   been   so   disappointed   in   a   salon   quality   hair   dryer .   i   am   a   blow   dry   addict   who   watches   my   stylist   closely   when   he   blows   my   hair   dry .   i   am   very   good   at   getting   a   salon   quality   blow   out   at   home .   i   used   this   product   for   4   months ,   and   it   is   sitting   in   the   back   of   a   drawer   now .   if   i   wasn   t   so   busy ,   i   would   send   it   back   and   demand   a   full   refund .   i   feel   like   i   was   duped .   the   strength   of   the   dryer   is   poor ,   which   results   in   dry   fly   aways .   it   also   does   not   get   hot   enough ,   so   after   you   have   spent   30   minutes   blowing   your   hair   dry ,   it   looks   like   it   is   still   damp   and   has   been   blown   out   with   a   super   market   dryer .   i   have   used   the   babyliss   and   solano   hair   dryers   in   the   past ,   and   am   going   back   to   them .   don   t   fall   for   the   hype   this   company   may   have   a   great   publicist ,   but   the   product   falls   short .
i   love   this   dryer !   i   love   this   dryer !   it   is   fast   and   relatively   quiet .   i   have   had   great   hair   days   ever   since   i   bought   this .   since   my   hair   dryers   only   seem   to   last   a   year   or   so ,   i   am   buying   a   couple   extras   as   backup .   i   think   this   is   the   best   hair   dryer   that   i   have   ever   owned .
small   but   powerful   i   was   hoping   it   would   be   as   quiet   as   the   description   i   have   a   dog   that   barks   at   blowdriers   but ,   no   such   luck .   it   s   about   as   noisy   as   any   of   them ,   i   guess .   but   it   is   small   and   powerful ...   i   d   recommend   it .
t3   evolution   flame   thrower   under   no   circumstances   should   a   hair   blowdryer   have   a   heat   setting   hot   enough   to   singe   your   hair   off .   i   now   have   sections   of   hair   that   have   been   burned   off .   also ,   when   i   put   my   hair   in   a   ponytail ,   i   have   hundreds   of   tiny   short   hairs   sticking   up   because   hairs   were   burned   off .   i   also   got   2   third   degree   burns   on   my   skin .   i   purchased   the   featherweight   first ,   took   it   back   for   the   evolution   thought   maybe   with   more   settings   it   would   be   ok   .   that   s   when   i   noticed   my   hair   has   been   singed   off .   with   the   featherweight ,   you   have   two   heat   choices ,   flame   thrower   or   cold .   the   hottest   setting   on   the   evolution   is   the   one   that   singed   my   hair   off .   the   medium   setting ,   isn   t   quite   hot   enough   to   get   my   hair   straight .   so ,   back   this   one   is   going   too .   for   what   it   s   worth ,   my   sister   raved   about   this   dryer   and   she   bought   the   evolution ,   and   the   featherweight ,   and   the   travel   one .   she   is   made   of   money   though   and   i   think   unless   something   is   outrageously   expensive ,   she   gets   it   in   her   head   it   is   worthless .   also ,   she   always   uses   the   diffuser   and   always   does   the   curly   look   probably   on   cool   .   i   will   be   sticking   with   the   elchim   line ,   which   i   thought   was   outrageously   expensive   at   130   but   now   seems   like   a   bargain .   i   m   going   for   the   da   vinci   model   by   elchim   this   time .   all   the   best   salons   use   elchim .   it   s   funny   that   130   seems   like   a   deal   for   a   blowdryer   now .   i   purchased   mine   at   sephora .   so ,   this   review   is   nothing   against   amazon .   just   want   to   get   the   word   out   there   about   this   product .
already   had   one ,   needed   another   one !   my   wife   already   has   this   dryer ,   but   she   wanted   another   one   to   gift   someone .   the   good   thing   i   like   about   it   is   the   dual   voltage   switch ,   compact ,   very   simple   to   use .   also   it   has   the   cool   switch   that   blows   cold   air   that   my   wife   likes   as   well .   overall   simple   to   use   and   works   good .   the   only   con   i   can   think   of   is   the   chord   gets   in   the   way   a   lot .   by   the   way ,   the   old   one   we   had   is   still   good ,   except   there   is   some   rust   on   the   rim   now   so   try   to   keep   it   away   from   any   moisture ....
andis   blow   dryer   wow !   i   searched   and   searched   for   a   good   blow   dryer   and   decided   upon   this   one .   it   was   the   best   decision .   i   am   a   professional   so   i   have   to   have   a   sturdy   blow   dryer   and   this   one   is   that   and   more !   it   dries   the   hair   in   about   3   4   minutes   including   long   hair !   with   no   frizz !   i   love   it   and   would   buy   another   one   in   a   heartbeat !
worth   it !   this   dryer   works   as   well   as   everyone   said   it   does .   ...   .   definately   a   difference   in   the   speed   of   drying   your   hair   and   how   it   looks   afterwards .   it   is   quiet   and   also   a   bit   heavier   to   hold   than   other   dryers   i   have   used .   the   price   i   paid   getting   it   on   amazon   was   at   least   30   cheaper   than   what   i   saw   it   selling   for   in   the   stores .   it   is   worth   it ... you   won   t   be   disappointed .
it   s   just   ok ,   not   all   that !   the   on   off   switch   gets   in   the   way   of   holding   the   handle   and   it   often   turns   off   while   i   am   using   it .
awesome   dryer   i   picked   up   this   dryer   when   i   was   staying   some   nights   at   my   fiancee   s   apartment ,   so   i   could   stash   it   out   of   his   way   when   i   wasn   t   there .   it   folds   in   half   and   the   cord   retracts   into   the   handle ,   making   it   very   small .   i   was   immediately   impressed   with   the   power ,   i   have   pretty   thick   hair   but   i   could   completely   dry   it   in   just   a   few   minutes .   when   we   got   married   and   bought   a   house   it   has   stayed   on   with   me ,   becoming   my   primary   hair   dryer .   i   have   used   it   daily   for   about   3   years   now   and   it   has   not   faltered ,   definitely   worth   it !
it   burned   my   hair   off   i   have   the   silver   version   of   this   exact   blowdryer   i   had   it   for   about   a   year   and   always   used   an   attachment   on   the   end   of   it .   then   all   of   the   sudden   the   attachment   wasn   t   fitting   right   and   so   i   used   it   for   about   a   month   without   it .   i   have   always   noticed   how   hot   the   dryer   got   but   didn   t   think   anything   of   it .   i   was   blowdrying   my   hair   with   a   round   brush   and   suddenly   smelt   burning   hair .   much   to   my   surprise ,   it   had   burnt   that   chunk   of   my   hair   completely   off   and   i   now   have   a   patch   of   very   short ,   miscolored ,   burnt   hair   on   my   head .   horrible   product .   i   looked   at   the   attachment   also   and   the   plastic   on   the   inside   is   completely   melted   from   it   getting   too   hot .   no   wonder   it   wasn   t   fitting   anymore .
great   compact   travel   hairdryer   i   bought   this   hairdryer   to   use   while   vacationing   in   europe .   it   worked   great !   it   is   true   that   you   can   only   use   the   low   setting   in   europe   however ,   it   seemed   as   though   the   low   setting   was   putting   out   as   much   air   as   the   high   setting   usually   does   here   in   the   us .   also ,   i   only   took   a   small   carry   on   suitcase   to   europe .   because   of   the   fold   down   capability ,   this   hairdryer   fit   perfectly   into   my   carry   on .   i   would   highly   recommend   this   product !
great   hairdryer !   love   the   hairdryer ,   it   works   amazing !   my   only   problem   that   everyone   should   know   is   that   i   bought   it   for   the   4   year   warranty   because   i   have   had   2   chi   hairdryers   that   broke   just   after   my   1   year   warranty   expired !   therefor   this   hairdryer   was   appealing   to   me .   the   only   problem   is   bespoke   labs   wont   honor   my   warranty   because   it   was   not   purchased   by   an   authorized   beauty   supply   dealer .   so   i   am   screwed   if   this   breaks   early !
run   away !   don   t   waste   another   minute   of   your   life   looking   at   this   piece   of   junk .   i   am   very   disappointed .   first ,   the   wall   mount ... these   screw   anchors   are   the   largest   i   ve   used   on   such   a   small   device .   my   last   mounted   hair   dry   used   pilot   holes   almost   half   the   size .   my   son   s   book   shelves   used   smaller   holes   than   these   things !   then ,   once   you   get   these   beasts   into   the   wall ,   the   unit   mounts   onto   the   mounting   plate   with   a   single   turn   screw .   so   the   white   plastic   unit   still   wiggles   every   time   you   use   the   hair   dryer !   second ,   this   thing   only   runs   for   15   seconds   before   overheating   yes ,   i   timed   it   !   sure ,   you   could   turn   it   down   so   the   heating   coils   are   off ,   and   the   fan   still   in   high ,   but   what   s   the   point   my   wife ,   with   shoulder   length   hair ,   refuses   to   use   it   because   it   turns   off   so   quickly .   do   your   self   a   favor   and   look   somewhere   else !
great   color !   overall ,   i   like   this   hairdryer   a   lot .   the   thing   that   first   drew   me   to   this   hairdryer   the   color .   it   s   a   bright ,   shiny ,   fushia   color .   the   make   is   very   sleek   and   stylish .   infiniti ,   by   conair ,   is   light   and   easy   to   handle ,   even   when   you   re   using   a   brush   with   your   other   hand !   the   best   part   of   this   hairdryer   is ,   by   far ,   the   retractable   cord ,   which   makes   it   very   easy   to   store .   the   filter   is   removable ,   making   the   life   of   your   hairdryer   longer !   br   br   your   hairdryer   comes   with   a   concentrator   to   help   straighten   your   wavy   or   curly   hair   and   a   diffuser   to   give   it   body   and   life .   it   also   is   equipped   with   tourmaline   ceramic   technology   which ,   according   to   the   box ,   generates   ions   that   work   hair   molecules   to   help   dry   them   inside   and   out ...   ions   smooth   the   cuticle   layer ...   creating   a   silky ,   shiny   look .   br   br   i   found   the   infiniti   to   be   a   very   usable   hairdryer .   with   heat   options   hot   ,   warm   ,   and   cool   ,   and   power   levels   high   and   low   ,   there   are   plenty   of   way   to   dry   and   style   your   hair .   hot   never   got   too   hot   and   warm   was   perfect   for   my   use .   some   hairdryers   take   a   long   time   to   cool   down   afterwards ,   but   i   am   happy   to   report   that   the   infiniti   cooled   off   quite   quickly .   the   retractable   cord   is   also   very   handy .   one   quick   word   of   warning   about   the   cord ,   it   retracts   very   fast .   be   careful   of   fingers   or   retract   it   little   by   little   and   not   all   at   once .   br   br   from   my   experience ,   my   hair   did   look   straighter   and   more   silky   than   usual ,   which   might   be   due   to   the   tourmaline   ceramic   technology   .   as   mentioned   before ,   i   really   do   like   this   hairdryer .
nice   for   the   price   i   can   t   locate   the   serial   number   for   this   anywhere ,   so   i   have   to   wonder   where   these   came   from .   on   the   other   hand ,   they   are   very   light ,   quiet ,   and   dry   my   hair   more   quickly   than   my   20   dryer   did .   i   have   medium   texture   curly   wavy   blonde   hair ,   and   it   makes   my   hair   shinier   than   i   m   used   to   with   just   the   blow   dry ,   but   not   really   any   less   frizzy .   however ,   the   dryer   is   very   hot   which   seems   to   make   using   my   flat   iron   take   longer   since   the   hair   seems   to   have   already   been   heat   styled   into   a   specific   position   pouf   with   the   dryer   my   old   dryer   didn   t   provide   such   an   effect .   interesting   tradeoff ,   but   i   would   keep   the   t3   over   my   old   one .
hairdryer   love   hairdryer .   my   hair   is   in   great   shape   since   switching   to   it .   the   only   thing   that   i   wish   it   had   was   a   hot   warm   setting   in   addition   to   the   high   low
painfully   self   destructed   after   3   years   an   update   updated   11   9   12   about   2   months   ago   the   original   plug   went   bad .   it   had   a   built   in   gfci   feature   and   the   trip   switch   eventually   became   stuck   so   that   it   would   not   turn   on .   i   replaced   the   plug   with   a   new ,   heavy   duty   one   i   bought   at   home   depot ,   figuring   the   bathroom   outlet   s   gfci   feature   would   provide   the   same   protection .   then   last   night ,   while   drying   my   daughter   s   hair ,   it   started   to   smell   of   something   burning   and   a   few   hot   ceramic   embers   came   shooting   out .   one   stung   my   daughter   on   the   back   of   the   neck   and   while   i   waved   my   hand   in   front   i   got   one   embedded   in   my   hand .   very   small   but   very   hot   stinging .   i   threw   it   away   for   safety   reason .   so ,   it   worked   fine   for   3   years   but   died   an   painful   death .   be   aware .   br   br   original   review   br   i   was   using   a   25   year   old ,   1200   watt   hair   dryer .   it   may   lost   some   of   its   punch   over   the   years   but   it   did   dry   hair .   this   is   an   upgrade ,   but   it   isn   t   a   radical   difference .   the   upside   is   the   retractable   cord .   this   makes   getting   it   out   and   putting   it   away   much   easier   and   faster .   the   downside   is   that   the   cord   is   fairly   short   the   big   safety   device   at   the   plug   end   is   another   story   .   i   ll   learn   to   live   with   it ,   but   when   i   m   trying   to   dry   the   hair   of   my   7   and   8   year   olds ,   who   move   around   a   lot ,   a   longer   cord   is   welcome .   now   i   have   to   get   them   to   move   their   head   around   instead   of   me   moving   the   dryer   around .   one   thing   i   have   noticed   is   that   my   kids   now   complain   the   air   is   too   hot ,   something   they   didn   t   do   with   the   old   dryer   i   have   to   switch   to   medium   heat ,   and   then   it   takes   longer   .   it   has   a   hot ,   medium   and   cool   setting   and   a   cool   push   button   for   interrupting   a   hot   flow   and   slow   and   fast   speeds .   the   buttons   for   speed   and   temperature   are   similar   and   you   need   to   remember   which   is   which .   the   cord   retraction   button ,   which   is   not   obvious ,   is   up   on   the   motor   housing   somehow   i   keep   forgetting   it   s   there .   overall ,   a   good   dryer ,   with   some   benefits   and   drawbacks .
love   it   we   had   these   in   our   old   home   and   left   them   so   as   not   to   disturb   the   wallpaper .   we   were   so   happy   to   find   them   again   and   they   discounted   10   for   buying   two .   that   s   so   great .   it   is   awesome   not   to   have   to   look   for   your   hairdryer   and   put   it   away   each   time !
love   it   i   love   the   blowdryer ,   the   only   thing   is   the   color   was   not   what   you   see   in   the   picture ,   it   was   a   shade   of   a   greenish   gold   color .   other   than   that   it   s   great .
barely   satisfied   it   does   not   heat   as   well   as   i   think   it   should ,   barely   adequate   and   would   not   purchase   again .
worked   well   on   fine   hair .   i   used   the   infiniti   by   conair   223f   blow   dryer   on   my   10   year   olds   hair .   she   has   a   head   full   of   long   blond   hair   but   it   is   fine .   usually   when   i   use   a   blow   dryer   on   her   hair   it   gets   to   be   fly   away   and   static   filled .   this   blow   dryer   worked   great   on   her   hair .   it   left   it   looking   smooth   and   with   a   nice   shine .   she   didn   t   get   the   fly   away   messy   look   from   it .   i   started   out   using   the   hot   setting   and   then   moved   down   to   the   warm   setting   as   her   hair   was   drying .   she   liked   that   i   was   able   to   use   the   cooler   setting   especially   when   blowing   it   on   her   face   to   dry   her   bangs .   i   love   that   the   cord   retracts   back   into   the   handle   for   storing .   makes   it   much   easier   to   put   away   when   done   using   it   and   also   makes   it   nice   while   using   it   that   you   don   t   have   to   have   a   long   cord   dangling   in   your   way .   i   don   t   mind   the   color ,   it   actually   looks   more   of   a   reddish   purple   to   me   than   pink .   the   dryer   is   a   little   bulky   for   smaller   hands .   my   daughter   thought   it   was   a   bit   heavy   for   her   smaller   hands   but   i   had   no   problem   hanging   on   to   it   and   using   it .   overall ,   a   nice   blow   dryer   that   works   well .
great   dryer   this   hair   dryer   does   wonders   on   naturally   wavy ,   thick   hair .   it   does   reduce   frizz   and   makes   it   very   soft   and   smooth .   the   three   heat   settings   are   amazing   too   and   i   can   t   even   say   how   much   i   love   the   retractable   cord   feature ...   no   more   trying   to   make   my   cord   wrap   around   my   dryer   to   keep   it   out   of   the   way .   great   product .
hooded   dryer   this   dryer   is   good   because   it   s   easy   to   use ,   but ,   i   have   a   couple   of   hang   ups   about   it   though   1 .   it   doesn   t   have   a   timer .   2 .   the   holes   aren   t   well   distributed   for   even   heat   penetration .   overall ,   it   s   a   decent   hair   dryer .   i   use   it   to   deep   condition .
wallmont   hair   dryer   i   love   that   my   hair   dryer   is   no   longer   cluttering   up   my   sink   area .   the   cavity   behind   the   wallmount   is   spacious   and   allows   me   the   hide   the   extra   power   cord   that   i   do   not   need .   i   really   like   the   night   light   too .   the   1600   watts   may   be   a   ittle   underpowered   for   some   but   it   is   fine   for   me .

not   perfect ,   but   it   gets   the   job   done ...   first ,   let   me   start   by   saying ,   i   use   my   blow   dryer   lightly   compared   to   others ,   so   i   can   t   comment   on   the   longevity   of   this   dryer .   i   am   convinced   there   is   no   perfect   hair   dryer   out   there ,   but   this   particular   one   does   a   great   job .   br   br   i   really   like   how   quiet   this   is   compared   to   some   other   models   i   ve   owned .   even   on   high ,   the   noise   is   dramatically   muted   if   you   shower   during   your   childs   naptime   as   i   do ,   then   this   is   huge !   .   while   i   initially   thought   the   retractable   cord   would   be   a   plus ,   it   makes   storing   the   entire   unit   very   cumbersome .   i   keep   my   dryer   in   a   drawer   in   my   bathroom .   my   old   dryer   had   to   have   the   cord   wrapped   around   it   a   million   times ,   but   overall ,   it   was   pretty   compact .   not   so   with   this   model .   the   end   of   the   plug   cord   is   thicker ,   and   difficult   to   bend ,   and   the   nose   of   the   dryer   is   a   bit   longer   then   i   m   used   to .   not   the   end   of   the   world   though .   br   br   i   tried   the   diffuser   one   day ,   but   found   it   to   be   a   huge   pain   to   work   with ,   so   i   just   set   it   aside ... i   ve   gone   this   long   without   ever   using   one ,   i   m   sure   i   ll   be   fine   without   it .   i   always   keep   the   concentrator   on   though   which   only   adds   to   the   size   of   the   dryer   come   storage   time   .   it   s   great   for   quick ,   high   temp   drying ,   or   for   bangs .   overall ,   i   d   recommend   this .   it   s   a   good   dryer   that   gets   the   job   done ,   even   though   storing   it   can   be   kinda   awkward ..
very   good   dryer   just   prefect   for   hair   drying .   dry   me   hair   within   10   sec ,   and   my   wife   s   in   2   mins .   br   hair   feel   even   softer   after .

powerful   little   dryer   i   had   recently   been   on   vacation ,   and   the   hotel   had   this   hair   dryer   in   their   bathrooms .   i   liked   it   so   much   i   decided   i   wanted   one   for   my   bathroom ,   found   it ,   and   purchased   it !   i   have   no   regrets .   br   br   first   of   all   i   love   the   convenience   of   having   it   mounted   within   easy   reach .   i   am   always   running   late ,   so   being   able   to   grab   and   dry   is   wonderful .   it   is   a   powerful   little   dryer   and   dries   my   hair   quickly .   br   br   i   know   others   complain   about   the   nightlight ...   in   the   beginning   it   seemed   bright   so   i   would   simply   pull   the   bathroom   door   to .   now   i   don   t   even   notice   it !   br   br   if   you   re   looking   for   something   efficient ,   practical   and   convenient ,   this   is   the   little   dryer   for   you !
convenient   and   light   weight   we   bought   one   which   lasted   3   1   2   years   of   fairly   tough   use   from   various   family   members .   loved   the   wall   mount   design ,   as   well   as   the   light   weight   of   the   dryer   if   you   have   children   or   seniors   who   have   difficulty   holding   heavy   dryers   for   any   length   of   time   this   is   one   of   the   lightest   weight   units   we   found .   for   the   price ,   we   paid   about   14.00   for   it   at   the   time   so   averages   out   to   about   3   per   year !   we   were   very   pleased   with   the   longevity   and   the   features   of   the   unit ,   and   are   buying   a   new   one   as   a   replacement .   asin   b0008ent8i   jerdon   1600w   wall   mount   hair   dryer  
oster   wall   mount   hair   dryer   mounting   was   very   easy .   the   hairdryer   looks   sleek   modern ,   works   efficiently .   i   m   very   happy   with   it .
excellent   hair   dryer   i   tried   this   in   a   recent   hotel   stay   and   had   to   order   one   for   myself   at   home .   the   dryer   has   a   retractable   cord   which   is   nice   and   it   drys   your   hair   quickly   and   without   frizz .
better   than   conair ,   but   really   not   that   amazing   i   have   thick ,   curly ,   coarse   hair   that   frizzes   horrendously .   i   have   to   completely   and   forcefully   dry   it   in   order   to   tame   it   down .   i   ve   bought   dozens   of   blow   dryers   in   my   lifetime   to   battle   my   hair ,   most   from   the   drugstore .   despite   having   consistently   mediocre   to   poor   experiences   with   these   cheapies ,   i   stupidly   found   myself   continuing   to   buy   them .   i   have   no   fewer   than   4   unused   conairs   relegated   to   the   hall   closet   because   they   don   t   perform   acceptably .   and   that   s   in   addition   to   the   countless   ones   that   i   ve   thrown   away   when   they   broke .   so   i   finally   decided   to   change   tactics   and   buy   a   higher   end   model .   my   hair   stylist   recommended   the   elchim   brand ,   as   that   s   what   they   use   in   the   salon   i   go   to   vidal   sassoon   salon   .   it   s   definitely   a   step   up   from   the   conair ,   but   there   are   some   things   i   don   t   love   about   it .   things   i   like   good ,   strong   air   flow   feels   solid   plastic   feels   strong   and   not   flimsy .   i   ve   only   had   it   for   a   few   weeks ,   so   it   remains   to   be   seen   how   durable   it   is   compared   to   the   drugstore   cheapies ,   but   it   feels   like   it   won   t   break   as   quickly .   long   cord   so   you   can   move   around   as   needed   3   settings   each   for   air   flow   and   heat   things   i   don   t   like   hottest   setting   is   extremely   hot .   i   burned   my   finger   by   touching   my   hair   after   drying   a   lock   on   the   hottest   setting !   unfortunately ,   the   medium   setting   isn   t   quite   hot   enough .   so   i   ve   been   using   the   hottest   setting   and   moving   it   around   fast   so   it   doesn   t   heat   up   one   area   long   enough   to   fry   my   hair   or   my   fingers .   it   s   tiring   and   i   m   hoping   it   doesn   t   damage   my   hair   long   term .   no   cool   shot .   overall ,   seems   like   a   step   up   from   the   cheap   drugstore   dryers   because   the   air   flow   is   much   better   and   it   feels   more   durable   we   ll   see   if   that   proves   true   over   time   ,   but   for   some   people   it   might   not   be   worth   paying   twice   as   much .
would   buy   again   and   did !   this   is   light   weight ,   inexpensive ,   and   was   a   great   improvement   from   the   travel   hairdryer   that   finally   broke   after   10   years   of   use .   i   could   definitely   feel   the   soft   and   smoothing   effects   of   the   tourmaline .   in   fact   i   loved   it   so   much   that   i   bought   another   one   when   i   was   able   to   find   it   at   target   for   13 .   plus   it   s   soft   material   does   not   scrap   your   walls   or   furniture   when   they   rub   against   each   other .   highly   recommend   it !
could   be   better   i   purchased   this   hair   dryer   to   replace   one   my   daughter   borrowed   from   me .   i   thought   this   was   the   same   item ,   but   was   sadly   mistaken .   my   original   blow   dryer   was   also   conair   ion   shine   1875   watts ,   but   it   is   a   much   better   product ,   this   one   feels   very   plasticy   and   cheap ,   it   does   not   have   the   power   you   would   expect   for   1875   watts   either .   br   br   all   that   being   said   for   the   cost   of   the   dryer   it   works   and   i   will   keep   it ,   but   next   time   i   will   spend   a   few   extra   dollars   for   a   higher   quality   hair   dryer .
five   stars   great   product
dryer   my   hair   is   curly ,   so   i   think   this   dryer   is   not   so   stronger   for   my   hair .
love   this   hairdryer   i   ve   had   this   dryer   for   about   8   months   and   use   it   almost   every   day .   i   absolutely   love   it .   i   too   found   it   difficult   to   get   my   shoulder   length   hair   dry   in   a   reasonable   amount   of   time .   i   found   the   trick   is   to   dry   my   hair   with   a   blow   dryer   till   just   damp ,   roll   it   in   my   velcro   rollers ,   then   use   the   bonnet   dryer   while   putting   on   my   make   up   about   10   minutes   .   i   put   the   hose   away   while   it   s   still   warm   so   it   scrunches   up   easily   and   fits   back   in   the   unit .   i   wait   just   a   minute   or   two   til   my   hair   cools   then   pull   the   rollers   out   and   style .   hold   nice   volume   all   day   long .   i   ve   never   had   it   overheat   or   turn   off   on   me   knock   on   wood   .   i   ll   by   another   one   when   this   one   dies !
great   hairdryer   for   the   price   and   size   the   day   i   started   using   this   hairdryer ,   i   got   compliments   on   how   good   my   hair   looked   no   joke !   people   asked   me   if   i   d   gotten   a   haircut   and   i   had   to   tell   them   no ,   just   a   new   hairdryer .   it   s   a   powerful   machine   for   how   small   and   compact   it   is .   it   folds   up   nicely   to   fit   easily   in   a   gym   bag ,   suitcase   or   small   bathroom   drawer .   the   cord   doesn   t   retract ,   which   is   good   in   my   opinion   my   last   hairdryer   almost   started   a   fire   when   the   retracting   cord   frayed   and   sparked .   i   ll   update   if   anything   goes   wrong   with   this   dryer ,   but   i   ve   been   using   for   about   2   months   now   with   no   problems .   highly   recommend   it   for   the   price ,   value   and   functionality !
absolutely   worth   the   money ! !   after   years   of   buying   those   low   cost   hairdryers   that   i   knew   were   not   helping   my   thick   curly   already   dry   hair ,   like   another   reviewer   i   started   researching   for   the   best   one   i   could   find   and   i   knew   it   would   be   expensive .   well ,   this   one   is   absolutely   worth   every   penny .   my   hairstylist   was   using   this   dryer   and   it   took   1   2   the   time   to   dry   my   hair .   i   love   the   extra   long   cord   and   the   various   settings .   it   was   a   little   heavy   at   first ,   compared   to   my   old   vidal   sassoon   but   i   quickly   got   used   to   it .   you   will   not   be   disappointed .   i   d   purchase   another   one   in   a   heartbeat .

it   finally   arrived   the   hair   drier   is   as   it   was   described ,   the   price   was   really   good   and   my   daughter   and   her   long   hair   are   very   pleased   with   the   drier .   br   br   the   united   states   parcel   post   took   22   days   to   deliver   it .   it   would   be   worth   spending   an   extra   bit   of   change   to   get   a   faster   delivery .
does   the   job ,   for   it   s   size ...   updated   taking   into   account   that   this   is   a   travel   hair   dryer ,   i   have   no   complaints .   it   s   been   used   for   5   to   10   minutes   every   other   day   for   the   past   couple   months   and   so   far   not   a   problem   at   all .   there   is   only   one   tiny   design   complaint   i   have ,   and   that   is   i   figured   the   retractable   cord   would   be   completely   hidden   when   fully   retracted   but   theres   a   stopper   which   allows   a   good   10   inches   of   chord   to   remain ... i   wouldve   preferred   it   to   retract   completely   to   the   plug ,   but   fine .   i   expected   something   different   and   this   is   what   i   got ,   so   four   and   a   half   stars .   otherwise ,   so   far   a   great   product   for   the   unbeatable   price .   for   its   size   it   dries   fairly   quickly ,   and   does   indeed   fold   up   into   a   nice   little   package   however   you   ll   end   up   winding   the   rest   of   the   chord   around   it   anyway   .   and   the   folding   handle   makes   a   fair   amount   of   cracking   noise   when   you   fold   it ... not   the   smoothest   mechanism ,   but   fine .   once   again ,   not   perfect ,   but   for   size   it   s   as   good   as   it   gets .   br   update   it   s   now   been   a   good   12   months   or   so ,   and   the   usage   has   gone   up   to   5   10   minutes   almost   every   day .   it   s   fallen   off   the   counter   3   to   4   times ,   and   still   works   like   a   charm .   the   other   day   now   about   6   months   ago   however ,   the   button   to   retract   the   cord   flew   off   with   spring   while   the   cord   was   furiously   being   pulled   out .   i   tried   to   reattach   but   it   lost   its   retracting   mechanism .   fine ,   now   it   s   a   regular   drier .   although   i   do   have   to   admit   it   s   definitely   very   powerful   for   its   size ,   quite   amazing   actually .   still   works   like   a   charm .
several   notches   above   your   average   junk   hair   dryer .... or   is   it   update   10   5   2011   this   dryer   went   pop ,   began   to   breathe   fire   and   emit   noxious   fumes .   to   say   it   died   is   incorrect   i   turned   it   off .... permanently .   it   had   a   lifespan   of   three   years   and   five   months .   is   this   acceptable   for   a   hair   dryer   that   costs   about   150.00   not   as   far   as   i   am   concerned .   my   next   investment   in   hair   dryer   futures   asin   b002jsl6qi   babyliss   babtt5585   tt   tourmaline   3000   hair   dryer   .   br   br   original   review   the   hair   dryer   like   the   toaster   oven ,   the   cell   phone ,   and   the   corded   telephone   all   are   built   with   obsolescence   in   mind .   br   br   my   mother   owned   a   chrome   oster   hair   dryer   that   lasted   for   26   years .   sure   it   weighed   about   10   pounds   and   didn   t   have   a   concentrator   nozzle ,   but   it   was   built   to   endure .   the   oster   dryer   fit   into   a   stand   and   had   an   optional   plastic   hood   that   would   go   over   your   head   to   dry   your   curlerd   hair .   those   were   the   days !

good   value   for   the   money   currently   on   the   3rd   hair   dryer   in   10   years   so   happy   with   product   and   cost   is   very   reasonable .   availability   of   wallmount   dryers   is   limited   to   a   few   models .
great   hair   dryer   for   kids   my   daughter   was   getting   scared   of   the   hair   dryer   so   we   tried   this   one   and   she   loves .   in   addition   it   s   probably   the   best   hair   dryer   we   ve   owned   in   recent   memory   and   my   wife   wants   one   too   now .
finally !   i   love   this   hairdryer !   this   hairdryer   is   great !   it   is   light   weight   compare   to   my   old   hairdryer .   it   makes   my   hair   look   less   coarse   and   softer .   my   old   hair   dryer   made   my   hair   looked   very   dry   and   more   coarse .   i   just   love   it !
awesome   hairdryer ! ! ! !   this   is   one   of   the   best   hair   dryers   i   ve   ever   had ...   i   recommend   it   100   ,   and   it   s   worth   every   penny ! ! !
not   quiet   enough   i   am   returning   this   hairdryer   that   is ,   if   they   ll   let   me   i   still   haven   t   received   a   reply   to   my   request   and   it   s   been   a   week .   i   tried   it   once   and   found   it   had   a   high   pitched   loud   whine   which   my   other   quiet   hairdryer   fortunately   did   not   have   sassoon   discontinued   .   also ,   the   cords   were   too   short   and   the   light   is   way   too   bright .
adequate   for   the   type   of   product   that   it   is   difficult   to   place   on   head .   could   use   a   waist   strap   for   heating   unit   so   it   doesn   t   keep   falling   off   the   table   while   putting   on   bonnet
heavy ,   loud   and   not   that   great   this   product   is   not   worth   the   money .   it   s   very   heavy ,   very   very   loud   and   doesn   t   make   a   noticable   difference   in   the   drying   time   of   my   hair .   it   s   no   better   or   worse   than   the   typical   20   conair   or   revlon   dryer .   save   your   money .
extremely   noisy   at   this   point ,   most   hair   dryers   are   fairly   equal   in   their   ability   to   dry   hair .   so ,   i   was   looking   for   a   model   that   would   be   quiet   and   hopefully   not   expose   my   ears   to   as   much   damage   as   the   regular   hair   dryer .   this   model   highlighted   being   quiet   as   a   feature .   totally   untrue .   it   was   significantly   noisier   than   my   old   conair   dryer   which   cost   the   same .   i   will   not   trust   revlon   again .   buy   it   only   if   you   want   dry   hair   and   limited   hearing .
conair   hair   dryer   is   awesome !   years   ago   i   got   a   remington   hair   dryer   similar   to   this   one   and   through   the   years   and   many   moves   it   got   lost .   i   had   been   looking   for   one   a   long   time   and   i   found   it   at   amazon . com .   i   am   very   pleased   with   this   item .   i   would   recommend   the   product   and   your   service   to   anyone .
nice   this   is   a   wonderful   hair   dryer   so   great   to   be   out   of   the   way   on   the   counter !   would   have   given   5   stars ,   but   it   was   somewhat   difficult   to   install .   the   screws   supplied   were   too   small   and   the   unit   wobbled   on   the   wall .   we   purchased   new ,   longer   screws   and   fixed   the   issue .   it   is   in   our   quest   bedroom   and   i   m   sure   will   be   a   wonderful   welcome   to   out   of   town   quests .   just   like   a   hotel  
best   hair   dryer   i   ve   ever   purchased   i   was   very   close   to   purchasing   one   of   those   t3   hairdryers   but   didn   t   want   to   take   my   chances   after   reading   that   amazon   was   perhaps   an   unauthorized   seller   of   that   product .   i   went   ahead   and   decided   on   the   fhi   heat   nano   salon   pro   2000   and   i   can   honestly   say   that   it   was   worth   every   penny .   i   was   initially   skeptical   on   its   claims   that   it   cuts   drying   time   in   half   and   maintains   moisture   but   its   true .   i   have   type   3c   hair   which   is   kinky   yet   delicate   and   it   straightened   my   hair   like   a   dream .   not   to   mention   that   the   motor   is   half   as   quiet   as   the   any   cheap   drug   store   dryer .   i   would   highly   recommend   the   fhi   heat   nano   salon   pro   2000   to   anyone   wanting   a   quality   hair   dryer .   it   s   worth   the   investment
great   hair   its   light   weight   and   i   love   the   new   technology .   it   s   very   good   for   colored   treated   hair .
great   when   it   worked   i   purchased   this   hair   dryer   on   18   june   2008 ,   used   it   only   three   to   four   times   per   week   and   thought   it   worked   very   well .   my   hair   dried   quickly   and   was   left   soft   and   smooth .   then   only   21   days   after   the   one   year   warranty   expired   it   quit .   no   warning ,   no   apparent   problems ,   nothing   to   lead   me   to   believe   it   wouldn   t   last   a   long   time .   it   just   stopped   working   and   would   not   start   again .   the   dryer   still   looks   new ,   no   scratches ,   no   lint   in   the   air   intake   screen ,   no   kinks   in   the   cord ,   but   is   doesn   t   work .   before   it   quit ,   i   would   have   given   it   four   stars   deducting   one   for   being   rather   loud   ,   the   fact   that   it   lasted   barely   more   than   one   year   makes   me   want   to   give   it   zero   stars .   i   ll   compromise   and   offer   two   stars   and   wish   you   good   luck   if   you   decide   to   purchase   this   hair   dryer .
fabulous   dryer   i   was   pleasantly   surprised   by   this   hairdryer .   i   had   a   remington   for   about   8   years   and   finally   decided   it   was   time   for   a   new   one .   i   had   never   used   a   diffuser   before   as   i   have   short   hair   and   didn   t   think   it   would   do   too   much   for   me .   boy   was   i   wrong .   my   hair   doesn   t   have   this   much   volume   unless   i   use   a   product   in   it ! !   the   cord   wind   is   phenomenal ! ! ! !   i   always   hated   how   my   hair   dryer   took   up   half   of   my   counter   unless   i   unplugged   it   and   stored   it   under   the   sink .   for   something   i   use   everyday ,   it   never   happened .   i   thought   i   was   going   to   have   to   be   content   with   my   dryer   s   cord   all   over   the   place   until   now !   when   i   am   done   using   it ,   i   simply   hit   the   button   and   the   cord   goes   away   but   the   dryer   is   still   plugged   in   the   only   down   fall   is   that   the   cord   is   not   very   long .   luckily   my   outlet   is   right   next   to   my   bathroom   counter !   i   am   very   pleased   with   this   dryer   and   would   highly   recommend   it .
too   hot ,   literally   this   blow   dryer   has   only   two   settings ,   high   and   low   with   a   cold   shot ,   the   high   setting   is   very , very   hot ,   i   m   assuming   that   is   why   it   dries   hair   so   quickly ,   don   t   hold   it   in   the   same   place   for   too   long ,   you   could   burn   your   scalp .   i   do   like   the   light   weight   of   this   dryer   and   long   cord .   i   would   like   to   have   a   dryer   that   you   can   have   more   control   over   the   heat   and   output   of   air .   i   most   likely   will   not   spend   100.00   to   replace   this   dryer   with   the   same   model .

wish   i   read   all   of   the   reviews   before   i   bought   it !   i   wish   i   had   read   further   down   the   reviews   before   i   bought   this   myself .   i   read   the   first   few   reviews   at   the   time   everyone   seemed   to   love   it .   indeed ,   i   loved   it   when   i   first   got   it ,   so   much   so   that   i   bought   a   second   one   to   have   should   this   one   burn   out   that   happened   to   me   once   on   vacation ! !   .   over   time ,   i   noticed   my   hair   was   becoming   brittle   and   coarse   and   was   thinning   out .   i   attributed   it   to   a   new   medication   i   was   taking .   my   curly   hair   actually   turned   straight   because   of   this   medication   and   now   i   assumed   my   hair   was   continuing   to   morph   into   brittleness   and   falling   out   due   to   the   meds .   i   also   noticed   that   whenever   my   hair   dresser   cuts   blows   out   my   hair ,   i   have   soft   normal   hair .   i   thought   it   was   her   hair   products   that   gave   that   result .   while   ordering   this   as   a   gift   for   someone   recently ,   i   noticed   the   many   negative   reviews   which   described   exactly   what   had   happened   to   my   hair   too !   i   bought   a   new   different   brand   of   hair   dryer   and   my   hair   has   now   been   restored   to   normal ,   soft   shiny   hair   just   like   when   my   hair   dresser   does   it .   while   mine   has   never   burned   out   or   sparked ,   it   does   shoot   out   smoke   now   and   then ,   but   not   often .   stay   away   from   this   blow   dryer .   it   will   ruin   your   hair .

andis   hang   up   hair   dryer   i   was   looking   for   a   wall   mount   hair   dryer   and   came   up   with   the   andis   read   the   reviews   and   decided   that   this   dryer   was   for   me   in   the   2nd   bathroom   so   the   night   light   helps   and   is   not   in   anyway   visable   until   you   get   into   the   hallway .   great   hair   dryer   would   highly   recomend   this   one ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
don   t   buy   product   should   be   recalled .   when   i   first   purchased   this   product   in   march   of   2009   i   loved   it .   less   than   90   days   later   the   item   made   a   popping   sound   and   now   only   works   on   the   high   setting .   there   are   several   similar   comments   about   this   product   only   working   for   a   short   period   of   time ,   or   the   product   starting   to   spark .   buyer   beware .   this   item   is   probably   not   safe .
conair   i   have   always   felt   that   conair   makes   the   best   dryers .   it   is   quiet   and   drys   your   hair   quickly .   nice   black   color .   lightweight .
hairdryer   we   used   a   hairdryer   like   this   in   a   hotel .   it   was   so   powerful   that   we   came   home   and   ordered   one .   we   love   it .   it   cuts   the   drying   time   in   half .   it   folds   for   traveling   and   has   a   retractable   cord .   we   love   it !
amazing   i   was   impressed   the   first   time   i   used   this   hairdryer .   it   cut   my   drying   time   in   at   least   half .   and   it   was   alot   smoother .
love   it ... but   pricey   i   have   very ,   very   curly   hair   that   i   get   straightened ,   and   also   recently   had   a   brazilian   keratin   treatment   done ,   too .   i   m   tell   you   all   this   because   the   keratin   treatment   is   supposed   to   significantly   reduce   the   drying   time   of   your   hair ,   and   it   does .   so ,   while   i   did   notice   a   shorter   drying   time   with   this   dryer   than   with   my   other   ones ,   it   wasn   t   a   really   valid   measure   of   how   much   better   and   faster   it   was ,   because   any   dryer   is   pretty   fast   for   me   now .   i   decided   to   use   the   dryer   on   my   daughter   s   long ,   thick ,   wavy   hair .   the   unit   got   to   be   a   bit   heavy   it   wasn   t   noticeable   for   my   hair   because   it   was   such   a   short   drying   time   7   minutes   but   not   as   bad   as   many   other   full   sized   dryers   that   i   ve   used .   this   one   is   a   smaller   unit ,   but   it   is   loud .   it   did   successfully   dry   my   daughter   s   long   hair   in   1   3   1   2   the   usual   time .   and ,   her   hair   was   shinier   and   softer   than   with   a   regular   dryer .   i   am   assuming   that   s   from   the   tourmaline   and   or   ceramic   as   we   used   the   same   conditioner   s   we   ve   always   used .   so ,   overall   i   m   pleased   but   i   think   the   price   tag   is   a   bit   much   for   a   fairly   heavy   and   loud   dryer .
best   folding   handle ,   retractable   cord   dryer   i   used   another   brand   for   years ... and   i   replaced   them   every   few   months ... never   held   up .   i   have   limited   space   in   the   bathroom   and   love   the   retractable   cord   and   folding   handle   styles   for   that   reason .   i   discovered   this   andis   brand   version   at   a   hotel   five   star   and   searched   it   out   and   found   it   at   amazon .   i   m   very   happy   with   it   ...   it   has   already   outlasted   the   conair   versions ... only   reason   i   didn   t   give   it   five   stars   is   for   a   ceramic   ionic   dryer ... it   leaves   hair   quite   frizzy !   if   you   need   the   compactedness   of   this   dryer .... it   s   the   best   one   around .
this   is   a   great   quality   remington   product .   you   will   notice   the   quality   of   this   product   as   soon   as   its   out   of   the   package .   the   plastic   is   thick   and   has   some   give   to   it ,   not   like   that   cheap   stuff   that   is   hard   and   brittle .   the   motor   is   very   tolerable .   i   would   say   it   is   quieter   than   most   i   ve   used .   i   like   the   three   speeds   as   well   as   the   three   temps .   that   is   so   much   better   than   just   having   one   temp   and   a   slower   speed .   it   still   has   a   cold   shot   to   freeze   your   hair   when   you   ve   got   it   where   you   want   it .   great   product !
wonderful   conair   hair   dryer .   this   is   the   second   conair   204p   hair   dryer   that   i   ve   owned ,   and   it   is   truly   the   best   hair   dryer   i   ve   seen .   it   is   small ,   yet   powerful .   in   addition ,   it   is   quiet !   i   am   so   glad   to   have   found   it ,   as   it   came   out   in   stores   a   number   of   years   ago .   i   feel   especially   pleased   that   a   portion   of   my   purchase   goes   to   breast   cancer   awareness .   thank   you ,   amazon .
quiet   and   light   i   purchased   this   hairdrier   after   reading   the   reviews   from   consumer   reports   rated   in   the   top   2 .   i   tried   to   find   locally ,   but   couldn   t   find   any   from   this   manufacturer ... but   was   tired   of   noisy ,   heavy   hairdriers !   this   one   works   great ,   has   multiple   temperature   settings   and   is   quiet   and   light   with   an   extra   long   cord   to   boot .   it   is   also   very   attractively   styled .   no   regrets .
great   hairdryer   for   a   good   price   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   to   replace   an   old   conair   1875   watt   one .   the   old   one   was   at   least   12yrs .   old   and   was   still   working ,   but   making   strange   noises   so   i   decided   to   look   for   its   replacement   before   it   died   at   an   inopportune   time !   this   dryer   is   great .   it   has   a   lot   more   wind   power   than   the   old   one   did   but   it   does   not   seem   to   get   as   hot ,   which   with   the   power   is   not   an   issue ... it   does   not   burn   my   head   if   i   stay   in   one   place   too   long   as   the   old   one   did .   the   case   is   easy   to   hold ,   the   dual   controls   are   different ,   but   better   than   the   one   it   replaced .   i   would   recommend   this   hair   dryer   without   any   negative   issues .   i   did   not   want   to   spend   a   lot   of   money   for   an   ion   dryer   and   this   one   is   perfect .   it   leaves   my   hair   much   softer   and   manageable   and   does   a   good   job   of   drying   hair   fast .   the   amazon   statement   did   not   mention   ion   ... but   on   the   box   it   states   it   is   an   ion   dryer .
not   real   strong ,   but   works   ok .   my   daughter   uses   this .   she   said   it   s   not   really   strong ,   but   it   shines   her   hair .   not   bad   for   the   money .
good   design ,   but   quality   could   be   better .   replacement   for   the   first   one ,   which   had   the   fan   blade   fly   apart   during   use .   cheap   plastic   fan   blade   where   metal   would   be   much   better .   it   was   out   of   warranty ,   and   because   i   took   the   case   apart   to   check   for   the   problem ,   they   would   neither   fix   it   or   sell   me   the   part   to   repair   it .   since   i   now   have   one   for   parts   other   than   the   fan ,   and   the   hair   dryer   fit   so   well   where   i   had   it   hung ,   i   went   ahead   and   bought   another   one .   it   is   a   good   design ,   but   the   quality   could   be   better   when   it   comes   to   that   fan .   no   problem   with   anything   else ,   just   that   cheap   plastic   fan   blade ,   in   my   case   anyway .
the   best   blowdryer   ever ! ! !   my   yellowbird   has   finally   passed ,   after   about   5   years   of   blowing   out   the   hair   of   my   family   and   friends .   i   am   an   african   american   female ,   and   this   blowdryer   has   straightened   out   some   of   the   toughest   hair   imaginable !   i   braid   the   hair   of   my   family   and   friends ,   and   this   dryer   has   been   well   used   on   a   weekly   basis   since   i   took   it   out   of   the   package .   i   used   it   up   until   it   died   on   me   today ! ! !   i   am   soooo   glad   that   amazon   sells   it ,   b   c   i   am   about   to   purchase   a   new   one   right   now !
fine   product   i   bought   5   of   these   with   nightlight   to   put   in   each   bathroom   of   my   home .   i   find   the   light   is   a   useful   addition   and   can   be   turned   off   by   clicking   the   test   button   on   the   power   cord .   the   dryer   is   powerful ,   not   extremely   noisy ,   and   appears   to   be   of   good   quality   contruction .
ouch !   i   had   a   different   wall   mount   dryer   that   died   on   me   and   was   trying   to   find   something   that   would   last   longer   i   had   the   last   one   for   a   few   years   but ...   so   i   purchased   this   item   based   on   the   reviews .   i   was   disappointed   in   the   quality   of   the   dryer .   the   wall   mount   itself   was   flimsy   and   there   is   no   filter   on   the   back   to   clean   out   and   keep   your   hair   from   being   sucked   into   the   back .   unless   i   am   very   careful ,   my   hair   gets   sucked   into   the   fan   in   the   back   and   ripped   out   of   my   head .   i   will   use   it   until   it   dies   but   i   would   not   purchase   this   product   again .
solid ,   reliable   the   remington   d   2012   is   a   solid ,   reliable   hair   dryer .   the   controls   are   easy   to   access   and   use .   the   hot   is   really   hot   and   the   cool   is   really   cool .   there   is   a   noticeable   difference   between   the   heat   levels   and   between   the   intensity   levels .   it   s   a   good   size ,   and   not   too   heavy .   it   s   easy   to   clean .   the   attachments   fit   well .   br   br   my   only   quibbles   are   that   the   finish   shows   every   single   fingerprint ,   and   there   are   plenty   after   you   ve   added   your   mousse   or   styling   gel .   and   i   would   love   a   retractable   cord .   try   as   i   might ,   i   can   never   wind   up   the   cord   into   a   tidy   compact   mass .
you   d   swear   you   walked   out   of   a   salon   i   just   used   my   dryer   last   night   and   i   m   in   love .   my   3   year   old   conair   dryer   broke   last   week   so   i   did   my   research   and   saw   the   great   review   on   this   product   and   they   were   right ,   it   s   great !   the   dryer   is   a   bit   heavier   than   the   old   one ,   but   after   a   few   minutes   you   realize   the   heaviness   relates   to   the   quality .   it   almost   gives   it   a   little   bit   of   leverage   when   you   use   it .   the   airflow   is   salon   quality .   my   hair   dried   faster ,   looked   shinier   and   felt   extremely   soft .   it   doesn   t   feel   over   dried   or   brittle   as   it   usually   did   with   my   old   dryer .   i   dried   my   hair   no   more   than   once   a   week   for   that   reason ,   but   i   can   t   wait   to   use   it   every   time ,   if   i   keep   getting   these   results .   the   color   is   pretty   cool   and   the   retractable   cord   is   a   big   plus ,   no   more   tangles   and   messy   cords   taking   up   my   bathroom   space   now   if   only   they   could   do   that   with   my   curling   iron   over   all   i   highly   recommend   this   dryer ,   you   can   t   beat   the   quality   and   the   price .
great   hair   dryer   well   worth   the   money .   we   always   bought   inexpensive   hair   dryers ,   but   now   can   see   the   difference   a   professional   model   can   make .   would   buy   again .
too   loud   i   bought   this   to   replace   a   similar   andis   dryer   that   i   bought   2   years   ago   that   konked   out .   this   one   looked   similar ,   but   was   much   louder .   the   old   one   was   billed   as   being   quiet   this   one   was   not .   a   quiet   hairdryer   is   the   most   important   quality   for   me ,   so   now   i   am   off   to   find   one ...
does   wonders   for   my   porous ,   prone   to   frizz   hair   i   love   this   blow   dryer .   several   years   ago   my   old   professional   blow   dryer   died ,   and   i   ended   up   replacing   it   with   the   best   that   walmart   could   provide .   it   seemed   to   have   all   the   latest   and   greatest   technology   and   bells   and   whistles   3   heat   settings ,   cool   button ,   3   air   speeds   with   ion ,   ceramic   heat   ,   but   my   hair   just   wasn   t   getting   dry .   by   the   time   my   hair   dried   my   scalp   was   soaked ,   and   my   hair   was   was   still   frizzy   no   matter   how   much   anti   frizz   hair   product   i   used .   i   have   what   a   hair   professional   termed   textured   hair .   it   s   thick ,   porous ,   dries   slowly   because   it   retains   moisture ,   and   tends   to   frizz .   this   blow   dryer   dries   my   hair   fast ,   straight ,   and   my   hair   feels   great .   it   takes   half   the   time   to   actually   get   my   hair   dry   now ,   and   my   scalp   isn   t   soaked   afterwards .   this   blow   dryer   gives   me   the   same   results   as   my   salon   visits .   big   revelation .... not   all   blow   dryers   are   alike .   this   blow   dryer   is   an   investment ,   but   thanks   to   the   great   reviews   i   was   confident   in   giving   it   a   try ,   and   i   m   so   glad   i   did .   it   s   worth   every   penny   in   time   savings ,   and   i   like   my   hair   again ,   and   i   actually   have   a   hair   style .
great   dryer   hair   dyer   works   great   for   it   s   size .   it   doesnt   over   heat   like   some   customers   say   it   does .   works   great   for   condisioning   and   dying   hair .   only   drawback   i   see   is   it   s   hard   getting   everything   back   into   the   case
andis   33295   review   easy   to   mount   on   the   wall .   that   helps   to   free   up   counter   space .   it   drys   very   well   and   isn   t   too   noisey .   however   the   over   heating   sensor   in   the   hand   held   part   is   overly   active .   when   drying   my   hair   if   i   hold   it   close   to   my   head   it   will   shut   off   and   you   have   to   wait   for   it   to   cool   down   before   it   will   let   you   reset   it .
love   the   cfm   s   that   come   flying   out !   first   used   this   hair   dryer   in   a   hotel   room .   liked   it   so   much ,   when   i   came   home ,   i   ordered   two .   one   for   me   and   one   for   my   daughter .   it   is   so   powerful ,   it   dries   my   hair   very   fast .   more   than   twice   as   fast   as   my   previous   hair   dryer . !
avoid   at   all   cost !   only   one   advise   avoid   buying   this   horrible   product !   br   i   own   several   andis   pet   clipper   products   so   i   trusted   the   brand .   i   was   wrong !   br   i   don   t   think   andis   manufactured   this   product .   it   s   just   a   generic ,   low   quality   dryer   disguised   as   an   andis .
hair   dryer   i   ve   been   very   pleased   with   this   hairdryer .   i   read   the   reviews   here   before   buying   it   but   don   t   find   that   it   s   heavy   like   some   have   stated .   i   love   that   it   has   a   warm   setting   not   just   hot   and   cold  
the   best   i   have   had   as   a   professinal   stylist !   over   the   years   of   working   in   salons ,   my   own   included ,   i   have   had   many   dryers .   i   like   working   with   this   as   it   is   extremely   light   weight   and   dries   the   hair   very   fast   and   almost   frizz   free .   excellant   product   for   the   professional   stylist
perfect   size   and   weight   definitely   a   great   dryer .   nice   and   lightweight   yet   very   powerful   with   various   heat   settings .   most   professional   hair   dryers   are   large   and   very   heavy   so   your   arm   tires   while   drying   your   hair   but   this   one   is   smaller   and   easier   on   the   arm .   would   recommend .
great   hair   dryer   for   the   money   while   only   moderately   useful   for   drying   my   short   hair ,   i   loaned   this   to   my   fiance   to   check   it   out   and   she   said   it   was   great !   she   used   to   have   a   very   expensive   hair   dryer   and   said   that   this   one   worked   just   as   well .   of   course ,   everyone   s   hair   is   different   but   the   important   thing   is   that   the   temperature   is   good   and   with   the   optional   diffuser   attachment ,   there   are   more   options   depending   on   your   hair   style .   male   or   female ,   this   is   a   great   product   at   a   good   price   and   the   quality   seems   very   good   at   this   price   point   as   well .
terrific   hair   dryer !   this   remington   hair   dryer   really   is   a   terrific   hair   dryer .   i   ve   been   using   it   for   about   a   month   now   and   my   hair   has   never   looked   better .   it   has   three   heat   settings   and   two   speeds .   i   use   the   lowest   speed   unless   i   m   in   a   big   hurry .   i   do   the   same   with   the   heat   settings   because   all   of   them   are   great   for   drying   my   hair .   it   is   a   heavy   hair   dryer ,   but   that   does   not   matter   to   me .   i   never   dreamed   it   would   work   this   well .   after   drying   my   hair   and   then   using   the   flat   iron ,   my   hair   is   frizz   free   and   shiny .   i   love   it !
works   well   works   well .   glad   i   bought   it .   the   cord   keeper   is   certainly   a   nice   feature   and   the   bright   color   makes   it   easy   to   find   under   my   bathroom   cabinet .
excellent ,   powerful   action   we   ve   been   using   this   hair   dryer   for   a   few   weeks   now   on   a   constant   basis .   overall ,   this   is   a   powerful   blower   that   gets   your   hair   dry   quickly   with   excellent   balance   of   heat .   no   hot   spots   that   cheapo   dryers   can   develop .   yes ,   it   is   on   the   heavy   and   bulky   side   but   that   s   because   of   the   quality   construction .   i   have   no   doubt   this   dryer   will   continue   to   last   for   years   to   come .
great   hair   dryer   but   a   bit   on   the   heavy   side   when   i   got   this   hair   dryer   for   my   wife ,   she   was   impressed   by   the   quality   of   the   packaging   and   the   hair   dryer .   once   she   used   it ,   she   was   further   impressed   by   its   power   and   how   fast   it   dried   her   hair .   this   hair   dryer   is   amazingly   quiet   even   with   all   of   its   power ,   unlike   others   that   she   has   used   in   the   past .   it   comes   with   various   options   such   as   three   heat   settings ,   a   diffuser ,   and   a   cool   shot   button   that   provides   a   quick   blow   of   air   for   a   final   styling   touch .   the   only   reason   it   gets   four   stars   is   because   of   its   weight .
needs   stiffer   brush   the   genuine   boars   bristle   brush   is   too   soft   and   will   not   turn   or   lift   my   hair .   the   bristles   just   squish   out   and   do   not   stay   stiff   enough   to   work   hair .   i   think   the   boars   bristles   would   be   even   worse   with   thick   hair .   they   need   a   stiff   nylon   brush   option .   they   also   need   a   medium   speed   for   drying .   you   get   slow   low   and   fast   high   and   if   you   can   hold   your   finger   on   the   quick   heat   button   then   maybe   you   can   get   to   medium   heat   and   blowing   speed   from   the   low   setting   but   you   can   t   hold   the   button   for   long .   there   should   be   some   sort   of   trigger   with   the   quick   heat   button   built   in   or   a   way   to   lock   it   down .   i   don   t   use   the   other   two   attachments .   i   d   swap   them   for   two   different   brushes   or   one   good   stiff   brush   attachment .
excellent   hair   dyer   i   got   this   for   my   girl .   some   comments   are   mine ,   some   are   hers .   it   dries   really   quickly .   this   takes   about   half   of   the   time   that   i   am   used   to .   it   is   surprising   quiet   for   a   hair   dryer .   you   could   easily   use   this   without   completely   pissing   off   roommates   if   a   few   doors   are   closed .   the   best   hair   dryer   i   ve   used .   i   have   not   used   any   of   the   attachments ,   so   i   may   add   that   info   when   i   find   out .   not   much   else   to   say   other   than   i   really   like   this .   glad   i   have   it ,   i   would   recommend   this   to   a   friend .
just   what   i   need   to   cut   down   the   drying   time .   even   when   it   s   on   cool   my   hair   dries   fast .   i   wish   i   would   had   gotten   the   ceramic   one
nice   compact   hair   dryer   excellent   product ,   compact   and   powerful   with   ion   generator   and   cool   green   nightlight   led   .   nice   design   ,   built   in   ground   fault   protection   and   thoughtful   cord   hook .   very   easy   to   mount   and   fairly   quiet   in   operation ,   especially   on   low   speed .
calms   the   frizz ...   i   was   very   interested   in   trying   this   dryer   it   features   all   the   current   blow   dryer   buzzwords   tourmaline ,   titanium   and   ceramic   all   or   severely   guaranteed   to   calm   the   frizz   for   people   with   hair   like   mine .   my   hair   is   thick ,   with   a   wave ,   and   it   absolutely   mushrooms   after   blowdrying   or   in   high   humidity .   it   takes   forever   to   dry   my   hair ,   so   naturally   your   weary   arms   tick   up   the   heat   factor   to   get   it   dry   already ,   and   that   in   turn   ups   the   frizz   factor .   i   must   say ,   i   was   impressed .   the   dryer   features   several   heat   and   style   settings ,   so   to   give   an   honest   portrayal   of   the   results ,   i   kept   the   heat   on   the   equivalent   settings   as   my   usual   blow   dryer .   then ,   after   a   while   when   my   arms   would   usually   get   tired ,   i   increased   the   volume   setting .   unfortunately ,   with   this   blow   dryer ,   i   wasn   t   faking   the   exhaustion   in   my   arms .   this   isn   t   the   heaviest   blow   dryer   i   ve   ever   used ,   but   it   s   up   there !   if   there   was   such   a   thing   as   getting   muscled   from   using   blow   dryers ,   i   d   be   ahnold   already .   i   wasn   t   faking   it   when   i   reached   the   point   in   the   blow   drying   when   my   arms   were   saying ,   enough   already !   the   dryer   is   more   than   enough   power   to   accomplish   the   job .   what   was   interesting   was   after   my   hair   was   dry ,   it   really   was   less   frizzy   than   the   same   routine   done   with   my   usual   blower   dryer .   the   second   time   i   tried   it ,   it   was   raining   out   and   about   a   billion   percent   humidity ,   the   perfect   laboratory   for   determining   if   all   the   tourmaline   titanium   ceramic   add   ons   actually   worked   to   keep   hair   smooth .   it   kind   of   did .   what   i   can   say   was   my   hair   frizzed ,   but   it   frizzed   less ,   and   it   was   much   shinier   than   i   ve   ever   seen   my   hair   in   humid   weather .   i   guess   that   s   an   endorsement ,   but   not   enough   of   one   where   one   might   forgo   a   flat   iron   to   flatten   out   the   kinks .   the   dryer   comes   with   a   diffuser ,   which   i   ve   always   found   to   be   way   too   much   work   and   time   if   your   arms   hurt   with   regular   blow   drying ,   you   ll   be   crippled   when   you   re   done   using   a   diffuser   on   thick   hair !   if   you   re   in   the   market   for   a   blow   dryer ,   and   you   have   a   problem   with   the   frizzes ,   you   might   want   to   give   the   remington   serious   consideration .   it   did   a   nice   job   for   me ,   but   the   gold   standard   not   having   to   use   a   flat   iron   remains   elusive ,   even   with   this   dryer .
my   wife   rates   this   as   excellent ,   with   only   on   con   that   there   isn   t   one   lower   setting   for   the   fan .   my   wife   who   doesn   t   speak   write   english   by   the   way ,   hense   not   writing   this   herself   especially   likes   the   attachments   and   overall   quality   of   this   dryer ,   the   three   heat   settings   which   provide   just   the   right   range ,   as   well   as   the   no   heat   blow   only   setting .   br   br   but   she   says   the   blower   is   far   too   strong   and   wonders   why   it   doesn   t   provide   a   lower   setting   than   hurricane   strength .   i   can   only   guess   that   this   is   because   if   the   heat   setting   is   on   high   there   has   to   be   a   minimum   amount   of   fan   strength   to   keep   the   unit   from   catching   fire .   br   br   i   imagine   that   a   professional   hair   stylist   has   the   advantage   of   being   able   to   hold   the   dryer   some   distance   away   from   a   customer   s   head   and   that   s   why   it   s   so   hot   and   blows   so   strong ,   but   of   course   someone   using   it   on   themselves   doesn   t   have   that   advantage .   br   br   ceramic   is   nice ,   as   well   as   the   ion   emissions .   br   br   bottom   line   despite   complaining   about   the   strength   of   the   fan ,   she   already   tossed   her   old   dryer   and   uses   this   one   because   it   is   a   professional   level   item .   i   imagine   she   ll   get   used   to   the   fan   strength .
blew   the   circuit   breaker   on   1st   plug   in !   i   purchased   this   hair   dryer   and   when   i   plugged   it   in   for   the   first   time ,   it   knocked   my   outlet   surge   protector   and   also   the   circuit   breaker   for   the   bathroom !   i   had   not   even   turned   the   hair   dryer   on !   it   had   the   hot ,   electric   smell .   i   sent   it   back   for   a   refund   which   amazon   quickly   honored .   i   will   not   try   this   brand   again .
broke   after   three   years   of   use ,   i   mourn   its   loss   not   bad   for   20   hair   dryer ,   though   this   hair   dryer   was   everything   i   wanted   retractable   cord ,   folded   for   space   concerns ,   relatively   light   weight .   worked   well   enough   for   me .   however ,   it   broke   today ... but   i   ve   had   the   thing   for   three   years .   i   ve   used   it   pretty   sparingly ,   maybe   drying   my   hair   once   a   week   tops   except   for   two   month   long   periods ,   in   which   i   got   a   haircut   that   required   more   attention .   i   m   going   to   buy   a   similar   one ,   i   think .   i   love   the   design .   3   i   m   so ,   so   sad   that   it   s   dead .
excellent !   this   is   my   new   favorite   hair   dryer .   it   has   numerous   settings   so   i   can   get   the   heat   and   air   flow   that   i   want   for   various   sections   of   my   hair .   the   balance   is   good   and   it   is   not   too   heavy ,   which   tends   to   be   a   problem   with   other   hair   dryers   with   this   excellent   level   of   air   flow   volume .   i   wish   it   had   a   retractable   cord ,   but   that   would   add   bulk   that   i   would   probably   be   unhappy   with !
overall ,   pleased   there   is   not   much   i   can   add   to   what   has   already   been   written   about   this   blow   dryer .   i   made   my   purchase   based   on   what   others   had   said .   my   experience   mirrors   theirs .   it   is   a   very   powerful   dryer ,   relatively   quiet ,   and   fairly   lightweight .   as   mentioned ,   the   buttons   are   surprisingly   awkward   given   the   quality   of   the   dryer .   once   you   accept   you   ll   constantly   be   knocking   them   off   your   desired   speed   and   heat ,   you   ll   find   this   a   first   rate   hair   dryer .   wet   hair   is   no   match   for   this   dryer .
good   but   could   use   a   lower   setting   i   don   t   use   a   dryer   often   so   this   dryer   works   fine   for   me .   i   found   it   well   balanced ,   not   too   heavy ,   not   too   loud ,   and   it   did   dry   my   hair   fast .   the   only   thing   i   would   have   liked   is   a   lower   setting   that   doesn   t   blow   quite   so   hard .   i   have   very   fine   hair   and   even   on   low   this   dryer   blows   my   hair   all   over   the   place .   i   m   not   sure   i   would   love   it   if   i   needed   to   use   a   dryer   on   a   daily   basis   but   for   the   occasional   quick   dry   user   it   is   fine .   another   possible   issue   if   you   don   t   have   very   long   arms   you   may   find   the   nozzle   too   long   with   the   directional   attachment   in   place .   it   adds   a   lot   of   length   to   the   end   of   the   dryer   bringing   it   too   close   to   your   hair   which   can   do   damage .   it   does   have   a   cool   setting   which   i   did   like ,   it   takes   longer   to   dry   but   it   doesn   t   damage   fine   hair .
excellent   hair   dryer   i   am   very   happy   with   the   remington   d   2012   hair   dryer .   the   dryer   has   a   nice   heft   to   it   and   doesn   t   feel   cheap ,   but   isn   t   overly   cumbersome   either .   it   dries   my   hair   very   well ,   and   seems   to   keep   frizz   to   a   minimum   thanks   to   it   s   lower   heat   and   air   settings .   the   dryer   definitely   makes   noise   on   high ,   but   it   s   not   as   loud   as   most   i   ve   encountered ,   so   for   me   it   s   a   non   issue .   the   attachments   included   seem   to   stay   put   for   me ,   i   ve   had   no   problems   with   them   falling   off   or   coming   loose   while   using   the   dryer .   the   switches   have   a   solid   feel   to   them ,   are   well   placed   too ,   reducing   the   chance   of   accidentally   changing   the   settings .   one   difference   i   ve   noticed   compared   to   other   dryers   i   ve   used   is   when   changing   the   heat   settings   on   this   dryer ,   the   fan   motor   doesn   t   speed   up   or   slow   down   any   at   all .   with   other   dryers   if   you   turn   the   heat   up   the   fan   sounds   like   it   slows   some ,   and   turn   the   heat   down   the   fan   sounds   like   it   speeds   up   a   little .   perhaps   that   is   one   of   the   advantages   of   having   an   ac   fan   motor   instead   of   a   dc   motor   that   is   wired   into   the   heating   elements   via   a   rectifier   circuit   in   the   hair   dryer ,   less   stress   and   voltage   spikes   sags   to   shorten   the   life   of   the   fan   motor .   the   only   issues   i   could   think   of   is   the   cord   is   not   as   long   as   i   d   like   it   to   be .   another   2   or   3   feet   of   length   in   the   power   cord   would   make   a   huge   difference   for   the   better .   the   low   heat   setting   on   the   dryer   seems   to   be   cooler   than   the   low   heat   setting   on   all   the   other   dryers   i   ve   used   i . e .   it   s   barely   warmer   than   ambient   air   temperature .   whether   that   s   a   plus   or   a   minus   should   be   left   up   to   the   individual   user .   for   me ,   it   works   better   this   way ,   so   it   isn   t   necessarily   a   bad   thing ,   but   i   felt   it   worth   mentioning .
love   it !   i   ve   ordered   lots   of   things   on   amazon   before ,   but   this   is   the   first   time   i   feel   compelled   to   write   a   review .   i   just   love   this   hair   dryer !   i   bought   it   because   i   was   tired   of   all   the   different   cords   on   our   bathroom   counter   hair   dryer ,   straightener ,   curler ,   husband   s   shaver   charger ,   etc .   so   the   retractable   feature   was   what   drew   me   to   this   product .   but   after   using   it ,   i   ve   found   a   bunch   of   added   bonus ,   one   of   which   is   how   fast   it   dries   my   hair .   it   literally   takes   only   half   the   time   than   my   previous   drier .   it   s   also   pretty   quiet ,   and   the   ceramic   coil   doesn   t   produce   the   burning   smell   like   older   hair   driers   do .   overall   i   d   say   this   is   the   one   product   that   really   impressed   me .   ...  
buy   the   real   one   i   bought   this   product   too ,   to   get   it   at   a   lower   price .   but   honestly ,   its   not   worth   it   because   it   broke   within   3   months .   the   serial   number   on   the   product   was   not   legit   should   be   a   silver   label   ,   so   chances   are   the   products   shipped   from   amazon   are   not   real   t3   hairdryers .   also   considering   the   fact   that   amazon   is   not   a   licensed   distributor ,   you   should   avoid   buying   it   because   the   warranty   is   not   covered   by   the   manufacturer .   if   you   want   to   invest   in   this   hair   dryer   try   to   find   it   at   a   local   beauty   store   i   found   one   with   warranty   and   all   for   170   and   be   sure   to   look   for   the   silver   serial   number   label !
great   buy   andis   30130   hangup   1600w   wall   mount   hair   dryer   excellent   value   for   the   price ... telephone   style   cord   is   great !
good   blowdryer   for   the   i   selected   this   dryer   after   reading   other   reviewers   comments ,   as   i   was   looking   for   one   that   did   not   make   me   feel   like   i   was   opting   for   dry   hair   over   my   hearing .   i   was   replacing   one   that   had   many   of   the   same   features   as   this   one ,   except   it   felt   like   it   was   piercing   my   eardrums   to   use   it .   this   one   is   much   better ,   as   was   promised .   in   fact ,   it   really   is   the   best   blow   dryer   i   ve   ever   had .   the   only   reason   i   couldn   t   give   it   a   5   star   rating   is   because   of   the   button   that   retracts   the   cord .   it   was   placed   on   the   side   of   the   dryer   where   it   sticks   out ,   so   that   when   you   put   the   dryer   down   in   between   blows ,   it   pushes   the   button   and   startles   me   as   it   trys   to   retract .   it   should   have   been   made   so   that   the   button   recedes   a   bit   so   it   isn   t   accidently   pushed .   but ,   all   in   all ,   it   is   great .   i   have   learned   to   be   more   cautious   as   i   lay   it   down   and   am   happy   with   my   purchase .
decent   hair   dryer   i   purchased   this   dryer   because   i   have   another   conair   model   1875   that   i   absolutely   love   and   i   want   an   extra   to   keep   at   work .   this   one   isn   t   quite   as   quiet   or   as   quick   at   drying   as   my   other   model   1875 ,   but   nevertheless ,   it   is   much   quicker   and   quieter   than   my   old   regular   hair   dryers .   i   would   definitely   recommend   the   product   as   a   replacement   to   an   older   or   non   ionic   model   hair   dryer .
works   good   this   product   works   very   well   with   me   especially   i   have   short   hair .   the   only   weakness   of   this   product   is   the   hot   air   has   a   hard   time   to   flow   to   the   top   of   my   hair . i   have   to   pull   the   bonnet   up   high   on   my   head   to   the   upper   hair   to   dry .   however ,   i   cannot   style   my   hair   without   this   machine   any   more   because   this   one   works   very   well   and   save   time .
lightweight   but   powerful   the   hair   dryer   is   lightweight   but   powerful ,   easy   to   handle ,   and   versatile   in   its   variety   of   heat   and   fan   settings .   i   found   the   large   attachment   for   spreading   the   heat   over   the   entire   head   especially   helpful   for   when   i   wanted   to   dry   the   hair   without   blowing   it .   blow   drying   also   worked   well ,   with   ample   heat   to   get   the   job   done .   the   instant   cool   button   would   be   helpful   to   a   professional ,   but   the   heat   adjustment   switch   is   sufficient   for   me ,   a   casual   user .   the   motor   is   pleasantly   quiet .   br   br   the   only   slight   quibble   i   have   with   it   is   that   the   safety   feature   built   into   the   power   cord   makes   for   an   extra   layer   of   on   off   and   until   i   learned   which   button   was   on   and   which   was   emergency   off   i   found   myself   fumbling   around   for   half   a   minute   before   i   could   actually   turn   the   dryer   on .   it   s   not   intuitively   obvious   whether   a   red   button   should   mean   hot ,   and   therefore   on ,   or   whether   it   is   red   as   for   a   panic   button   to   turn   the   device   off   or   whether   the   reset   button   is   to   reset   the   unit   to   on   or   to   reset   it   to   off .  
it   dries   my   hair   great !   this   feels   and   acts   like   a   commercial   grade   hair   dryer .   the   heat   is   sufficient   and   it   dries   my   hair   quickly .   i   have   straight   medium   thick   hair   and   it   usually   takes   longer   with   my   other   hair   dryer ,   so   this   is   a   huge   plus .   my   daughter   has   very   curly   and   extremely   thick   hair   and   wants   to   take   this   dryer   from   me .   it   works   wonders   on   her   hair   and   cuts   her   dry   time   in   half .   we   are   very   pleased   with   the   remington   d   2012   dryer   but   if   there   were   to   be   modifications   in   the   future   it   would   be   to   perhaps   make   it   lighter   and   quieter .   if   you   want   fast ,   salon   dry   hair ,   this   is   a   great   purchase .
great   hair   dryer   i   had   read   the   review   in   in   style   and   my   prior   conair   hair   dryer   had   died .   it   works   great   and   i   love   the   retractable   cord .
light ,   quiet ,   fast   and   easy   to   manipulate !   love   it !   i   have   no   complaints   about   this   hairdryer .   it   is   quieter   than   any   other   dryer   i   have   used   and   dries   my   hair   quickly   on   the   medium   heat   setting .   it   comes   with   two   attachments ,   one   for   curly   and   one   for   a   more   direct   flow   of   air .   it   s   light   and   is   easy   to   hold   and   manipulate .   highly   recommended !
good   choice   this   is   a   good   hair   dryer .   it   worked   properly   in   europe .   it   is   compact   and   light   weight   to   carry .   i   would   definitely   recommend   it .
great   dryer   happy   wife   quick   delivery .   used   dryer   in   great   shape .   the   mrs .   is   hard   to   please   when   it   comes   to   hair   care   products .   another   great   product   from   conair   and   another   safe   and   enjoyable   transaction   with   the   big   a   way   to   go   amazon
not   impressed   i   was   not   impressed   with   this   product .   the   hair   dryer   is   pretty   heavy   compared   to   some   of   the   other   ones   on   the   market ,   additionally   the   low   speed   setting   still   blows   your   hair   too   much ,   making   it   harder   to   style   your   hair .   however ,   it   does   come   with   a   diffuser   which   is   something   that   you   don   t   normally   get   with   a   blow   dryer .
love   it !   i   love   the   way   this   dryer   works .   it   s   not   so   powerful   that   it   blows   the   hair   all   over   the   place   but   it   s   ionic   feature   makes   my   hair   feel   so   much   thicker   and   i   love   the   nightlight ,   too !
comfortable   hair   drying   1 .   i   was   very   happy   with   the   smaller   size   and   lighter   weight   of   this   dryer .   it   doesn   t   get   heavy   while   using .   br   2 .   i   really   appreciate   the   easy   reach   of   the   temperature   buttons ,   cool   shot   and   on   and   off   buttons .   br   3 .   it   also   dries   hair   more   quickly   than   other   dryers .   br   4 .   it   has   a   nice   look   to   it .   br   5 .   lastly ,   this   dryer   is   easy   on   the   hair   too . it   leaves   hair   feeling   soft   and   looking   glossy .   br   i   love   it   and   recommend   it   highly .
bought   walmart   for   only   11 ! ! ! !   i   bought   this   exact   drier   from   walmart   yesterday   it   was   50   off ... and   i   couldnt   wait   to   use   and   when   i   did   i   loved   it ... i   can   talk   to   my   fiancee   and   still   hear   him   while   using   it   do   to   the   reduced   noise ... the   only   thing   is   that   it   takes   longer   to   dry   hair   than   most   dryers   but   so   what   plan   ahead   and   make   time   for   your   hair ! ! ! !
great   unit   this   wall   mounted   unit   was   easy   to   install ,   has   plenty   of   power   and   eliminates   all   the   bother   of   storage   and   cord   untangling   of   a   portable   unit .   the   automatic   shutoff   feature   works   great .   the   unit   has   2   speeds ,   however   the   high   speed   is   normally   used .
amazing !   this   dryer   is   even   better   than   the   one   my   stylist   uses ,   he   s   so   jealous !   takes   me   half   as   long   to   dry   my   long   thick   hair   now ,   and   it   s   not   as   frizzy   either .   great   dryer !   oh ,   and   it   s   so   quiet   too ,   i   don   t   have   to   worry   about   waking   anyone   in   the   next   room   when   i   do   my   hair .
effective   quiet   dryer   we   purchased   this   unit   after   seeing   it   previewed   on   a   shopping   channel   and   hearing   how   professional   stylists   in   hollywood   and   elsewhere   use   it   with   great   effectivness .   our   experience   is   the   same .   on   the   low   heat   setting   the   temperature   is   consistent   and   the   unit   is   much   quieter   than   any   other   brand   we   ve   tried   before .   it   has   a   nice   long   cord   and   comes   with   a   supply   of   air   filters .   i   have   been   able   to   eliminate   hairspray   as   i   style   the   hair   with   the   dryer   and   a   comb .   there   must   be   something   special   in   the   tourmaline   technology   and   ions   because   my   hair   looks   great .   i   recommend   this   product   to   anyone   looking   for   a   new   hair   dryer .   it   costs   more   than   most   dryers   but   the   product   quality ,   the   quietness   on   the   low   setting ,   the   long   cord ,   the   most   important   item ,   the   way   my   hair   looks   makes   the   price   worth   it .

not   enough   power   ....   i   was   expecting   more   power .   in   all   fairness ,   my   regular   home   use   hairdryers   are   larger ,   very   powerful   and   much   more   expensive   models .   i   wanted   something   lighter   and   dual   voltage .   this   did   not   work   for   me   and   i   returned   it   immediately   for   a   refund .
great   bargain   this   is   a   great   product   and   the   price   half   of   what   you   would   pay   at   a   salon .
nothing   special   the   weight   of   this   item   isn   t   any   different   from   the   others   i   ve   used .   slightly   heavier   than   my   healthy   infusions   by   wahl   pro   dryer   it   my   opinion .   seems   nothing   special .   br   br   i   don   t   like   the   long   nozzle .   perhaps   if   you   have   very   long   limbs ,   you   wouldn   t   have   as   much   trouble   drying   the   top   and   top   rear   potions   of   your   head .   br   br   the   wind   output   is   pretty   good ,   though .   comparable   to   my   healthy   infusions   by   wahl   pro   dryer ,   it   s   about   the   same .   br   br   no   swivel   cord .   buttons   feel   a   bit   cheap ,   but   i   guess   it   s   a   hair   dryer ...   nothing   fancy   here .   br   br   no ,   it   s   not   quiet .   it   s   as   noisy   as   my   other   dryers .   br   br   it   doesn   t   seem   to   remove   frizzes   any   better   than   my   other   dryers   either .   br   br   all   in   all ,   nothing   special   here .   just   another   dryer .   i   d   not   pay   a   premium   for   it .
it   s   good   good ,   handy   little   hair   dryer   that   i   can   keep   in   a   drawer   at   the   bathroom   sink .   i   m   a   head   shaver   so   i   only   needed   this   for   my   son   occasionally   and   for   guests .   works   great .
t3   evolution   i   have   mid   back   length   thick   blonde   hair   which   typically   has   the   consistancy   of   cotton   candy   after   i   use   a   hair   dryer ... sticky   and   frizzy .   after   using   the   t3 ,   this   is   no   longer   a   problem .   the   next   morning   when   i   ran   my   brush   through   it ,   it   didn   t   so   much   as   snag .   as   for   the   warranty   issue ,   it   should   come   as   no   surprise ... almost   every   negative   review   is   because   of   this .   i   would   rather   chance   100   without   a   warranty   than   pay   200   more   for   one .   if   my   hair   dryer   blows   up ,   i   can   buy   a   new   one   and   still   have   spent   less   money .
they   break   and   the   manugacturer   doens   t   help   this   is   the   second   andis   hair   dryer   i   have   had .   the   first   was   a   gift   and   i   loved   it !   so   when   it   broke   after   8   months   of   3xs   a   week   use   i   didn   t   mind   buying   myself   a   new   one .   then   this   one   lasted   less   than   4   months !   just   up   and   stopped   working   mid   drying   one   day   thank   goodness   i   had   a   back   up !   i   tried   calling   and   emailing   the   customer   service   for   andis   repeatedly   and   have   been   completely   ignored !   i   used   to   recommend   this   brand   to   everyone   because   the   drying   capabilities   are   amazing   and   the   product   feels   sturdy   but   now   i   would   steer   clear .   my   last   conair   was   only   35   too   and   lasted   for   8   years !   i   would   rather   go   with   something   reliable   than   andis !
small   but   wonderful .   asin   b0009xh6v4   andis   33805   micro   turbo   1600w   dual   voltage   hair   dryer   my   10   year   old   granddaughter   never   used   a   hair   dryer   until   she   received   this   one   from   me   as   a   gift .   now   she   uses   her   dryer   every   night .   i   wanted   her   to   have   a   small   but   powerful   dryer ,   and   it   is .   i   will   be   ordering   one   for   myself   today .
great   product   i   bought   this   to   replace   one   just   like   it   ,   i   have   used   it   everyday   for   at   least   5years ,   i   love   the   way   it   is   out   of   the   way   ,   and   right   at   your   finger   tips .
works   well   but   minor   trouble   with   the   switches   the   product   was   delivered   on   time   and   worked   as   expected ,   mostly .   the   hair   drier   turns   on   as   soon   as   you   plug   it   in   and   i   found   it   impossible   to   turn   it   off   using   the   switch   on   the   handle .   the   switch   on   the   plug   adapter   did   work ,   and   perhaps   is   sufficient   but   i   d   prefer   having   a   switch   be   able   to   do   what   it   says .   i   needed   the   product   urgently   so   i   do   not   plan   to   contact   the   seller .
blow   dryer   item   was   shipped   quickly .   however   i   was   rather   disappointed   at   the   quality   of   the   item .   it   didn   t   leave   my   hair   as   soft   as   i   would   have   liked   it   to   be .   it   left   my   hair   big   and   frizzy .
small   but   mighty .   the   andis   33805   micro   turbo   is   easy   to   use ,   moves   a   lot   of   air ,   and   packs   just   as   easily   as   a   folding   travel   hair   dryer .   it   s   extremely   well   constructed   and   in   comparison   to   my   previous   folding   travel   hair   dryer ,   the   quality   of   everything   from   the   breaker   plug   to   switch   in   the   handle ,   far   exceeds   my   previous   unit .   could   be   used   as   a   everyday   hair   dryer   and   takes   up   very   little   space .
hand   held   with   a   hanger .   i   was   very   disappointed   with   this   dryer .   it   essentially   was   a   hand   held   dryer   with   a   hanger .   the   hanger   was   completely   independent   of   the   dryer .   i   thought   the   hanger   would   have   a   plug ,   but   no ,   the   dryer   had   the   plug   and   a   very   long   cord .   i   thought   the   hanger   would   turn   the   dryer   off   when   the   dryer   was   placed   in   the   hanger   no ,   you   just   turned   the   dryer   off   as   you   would   any   hand   held .   save   your   money   and   buy   a   hook   to   hang   your   dryer   on .
love   it ! !   my   hair   feels   so   soft   after   i   use   this   dryer ,   not   dry   and   frizzy .   i   use   it   w   the   diffuser .   i   love   it ! ! !
works   well !   my   favorite   blow   dryer !   dries   your   hair   fast   on   turbo   setting   with   minimal   damage .   note   for   those   with   wavy   hair ,   it   tended   to   straighten   out   my   curls   a   bit ,   but   didn   t   get   rid   of   frizz   so   much .
2nd   purchase   this   is   the   second   time   i   have   bought   this   dryer .   my   housekeeper   accidently   broke   the   little   latch   on   the   first   one   so   it   wouldn   t   atay   hung   up   anymore .   i   had   the   first   one   for   about   3   or   4   years   i   loved   it   enough   to   repurchase   rather   than   getting   another   brand   or   style .   highly   recommend   this   dryer   for   its   convenience   and   quick   hair   drying !
strong   and   sturdy   very   well   made .   much   quieter   than   most .   it   does   not   have   quite   the   power   as   i   am   used   to .   mounts   easily   on   the   wall .   i   would   definitely   buy   this   again .
love   this   hair   dryer ! !   this   ion   shine   hair   dryer   is   great ,   especially   for   my   hair ,   which   is   very   fine .   the   wattage   is   great   for   fine   hair   and   it   has   high   low   and   warm   hot   settings .   it   also   has   the   cool   shot   button   which   i   love .   the   ion   technology   is   really   nice ,   i   have   noticed   that   my   hair   is   very   soft   after   using   it   and   my   split   ends   are   practically   non   existent .   the   buttons   do   take   some   getting   used   to   but   totally   worth   it ! !
good   hairdryer   for   price   for   the   price ,   this   has   been   a   good   hairdryer .   i   was   considering   much   more   expensive   dryers   when   i   saw   reviews   for   this   one .   it   has   great   heat   control ,   very   cool   warm   very   hot .   i   accidentally   change   the   setting   with   my   fingers   like   other   reviewers ,   but   not   a   big   deal .   so   far ,   i   like   it .
love   this   hair   dryer   i   had   this   hair   dryer   for   years   until   the   surge   protector   button   on   the   plug   kept   popping   out .   i   bought   a   conair   hair   dryer   at   wal   mart   to   replace   it ,   got   home ,   plugged   it   in ,   and   couldn   t   believe   how   cheap   and   loud   it   sounded .   i   returned   it   immediately ,   and   was   happy   to   find   that   the   remington   was   available   from   amazon . com .   i   m   completely   sold   on   this   hair   dryer .   the   motor   is   quiet   and   drying   time   is   short .   the   only   problem   is   that   it   felt   slightly   heavy   at   first .   but   after   using   it   a   few   times ,   i   suppose   i   got   used   to   it   because   now   that   s   not   an   issue .
great   value   for   the   money !   works   well   for   the   money   invested .   simple ,   two   speed   rocker   switch   is   adequate   for   most   applications .   holder   is   very   secure   easy   to   take   dryer   out   and   to   put   back   .   cord   hanger   is   a   nice   touch ,   especially   if   unit   is   mounted   where   the   cord   might   dangle   onto   counter ,   into   sink ,   etc .   moderate   noise   level ,   typical   for   this   size   of   device .
nothing   special   doesn   t   really   get   hot   enough   for   ethnic   hair .   probably   would   work   fine   for   someone   with   really   thin   hair
horrible   this   product   was   just   bad .   after   i   rolled   my   hair ,   it   was   hard   to   put   the   cap   on   my   head .   the   strings   were   supposed   to   tighten ,   but   that   was   easier   said   than   done .   the   cap   never   got   tight   as   i   wanted   it .   so   this   product   was   just   bad .
makes   a   big   difference   this   is   a   great   hair   dryer .   i   blow   my   curly   hair   straight   and   then   flat   iron   it   smooth .   my   old   cheapo   dryers   would   create   a   mushroom   shaped   pouf   on   my   head ,   which ,   in   turn ,   would   take   forever   to   flat   iron   out .   this   dryer   makes   my   hair   noticeably   smoother   and   much   less   freaky !   and   cuts   my   time   with   the   flat   iron   in   half !   i   did   give   it   four   stars   instead   of   five   because   it   is   slightly   on   the   heavy   side ,   but   not   so   heavy   that   i   would   return   it .   i   would   purchase   it   again .   maybe   it   will   help   me   work   on   the   muscle   tone   in   my   arms  
hair   dryer   holder   this   product   arrived   as   described   in   the   product   information .   it   is   easy   to   use   and   has   been   a   big   help .   i   have   ra   and   have   trouble   holding   the   dryer   up   for   long   periods   of   time .   this   took   care   of   the   problem .
ruined   my   hair   this   dryer   ruined   my   hair ! ! !   at   first ,   after   i   bought   it ,   i   really   liked   how   quickly   it   dried   my   hair .   after   using   it   every   day   for   about   8   days ,   i   noticed   a   strange   smell ,   but   didn   t   know   what   it   was .   it   didn   t   smell   like   burning   hair ,   more   like   home   perm   solution .   i   switched   from   high   heat   which   had   been   fine   with   my   conair   to   the   medium   setting ,   and   the   smell   went   away ,   but   the   damage   continued .   i   have   medium   length   fine   straight   hair ,   and   the   ends   became   dry   and   frizzy   and   began   to   break   off .   after   a   month ,   my   hair   has   turned   to   brittle   straw ,   won   t   curl ,   and   is   breaking   all   over .   also ,   i   color   my   hair   with   semi   permanent   coloring ,   and   the   now   frizzy   ends   absorb   more   of   the   coloring ,   giving   a   strange   look .   i   realize   now   that   this   dryer   was   working   so   quickly   because   it   was   way   too   hot ,   even   on   the   medium   setting .   not   sure   if   the   ions   were   a   factor ,   but   it   doesn   t   matter .   after   reading   the   other   reviews   here ,   i   feel   lucky   not   to   have   experienced   sparks   or   flames .   i   m   getting   a   short   cut   and   a   new   dryer   and   waiting   for   my   hair   to   grow   out .   i   m   extremely   upset ,   and   definitely   will   not   purchase   another   revlon   product .
fast   and   heavy   hair   dryer   this   is   a   nice   professional   hair   dryer ,   so   far   its   working   nicely .   the   only   issue   is   the   overweight ,   but   it   compensates   with   faster   hair   drying   even   half   the   time   than   used   to   be   with   other   brands   .   me   and   my   wife   would   recommend   this   if   you   want   a   faster   hair   dryer   and   stronger   arm   muscles ...

love   this   dryer ! ! !   i   researched   hair   dryers   prior   to   making   my   purchase   because   this   is   something   i   rely   on   very   seriously   and   need   it   to   work   and   do   a   good   job .   i   was   replacing   a   very   cheap   and   extremely   annoying   hair   dryer   i   have   had   as   a   back   up .   i   have   not   been   disappointed .   it   has   a   nice   feel ,   is   not   annoyingly   noisy   and   does   a   great   job .   i   recommend   this   to   anyone   looking   for   a   quality   dryer .
not   happy   lost   the   low   heat   setting   in   the   first   couple   months .   it   caught   on   fire   before   it   was   a   year   old .   wouldn   t   recommend
so   far   so   good ! !   my   wife   seems   to   like   the   dryer   and   her   looks   great .   she   says   its   faster   her   only   comment   is   that   there   is   no   high   warm   only   a   high   hot .   its   a   great   product   for   a   good   price   hopefully   it   will   last   the   test   of   time .   according   to   the   other   reviews ,   you   can   t   return   it   to   the   manufacturer   when   purchased   on   amazon .   so   far   so   good ! !
my   hair   seems   limp   after   using ....   i   ve   had   two   hair   dryers   in   the   last   27   years   so   when   i   had   to   buy   another   this   weekend   i   wondered   what   all   of   the   ion   technology   stuff   was   all   about ... well ... i   m   not   sure   i   love   it .   my   hair   is   long   and   fine   and   i   had   to   use   three   times   the   amount   of   root   lifter   to   get   my   hair   to   do   anything   pretty   much   it   s   just   plastered   to   my   head !   the   other   thing   i   did   not   like   was   that   the   buttons   are   right   where   my   fingers   go   so   i   kept   hitting   them   and   changing   the   settings   as   i   was   drying .   a   plus   is   that   even   though   my   other   dryer   was   1875   watts   this   dryer   seems   much   more   forceful   and   it   dried   my   hair   over   all   very   quickly   without   getting   super   hot .   i   m   sure   the   dryer   is   much   better   for   my   hair   than   my   old   dryer ,   but   i   just   can   t   take   this   limp   hair !   i   ll   update   in   a   few   days ,   maybe   it   was   just   a   bad   weather   day ....
broke   after   a   few   months   i   owned   this   hairdryer   for   about   6   months .   i   must   have   gotten   a   dud   because   it   never   seemed   really   powerful ,   got   waaaay   too   hot ,   and   broke   after   6   months .   my   hair   didn   t   look   any   different   with   this   dryer   than   with   my   old   conair   cheapie   that   i   got   from   cvs .
convenient   hair   dryer   we   ve   owned   three   of   this   model   hair   dryer   now .   the   first   one   lasted   five   years   and   the   second   lasted   4   1   2   years .   that   s   roughly   6   year   which   allows   me   to   justify   replacing   the   unit   with   the   same   model .   that   and   the   fact   that   the   mount   is   already   on   the   wall .   of   course ,   we   still   have   our   backup   hair   dryer   which   is   a   gillette   pro   max   that   i   received   30   years   ago   when   i   was   sixteen .   that   one   is   still   going   strong .
small   dryer   with   a   lot   of   kick   i   first   discovered   this   little   gem   of   a   hairdryer   at   our   condo .   while   on   vacation   near   orlando .   i   was   so   impressed ,   i   ordered   one   when   i   got   home   and   use   it   as   a   spare   when   i   go   to   the   gym .   there   s   a   lot   of   power   in   this   little   dryer   two   speeds   high   and   low .   i   prefer   high   and   my   hair   which   is   fairly   long   and   thick   dries   very   quickly   and   seems   to   wave   extra   nicely   with   this   dryer .   i   love   it !
works   great   thought   it   was   a   little   heavy   when   i   first   used   it .   i   got   used   to   using   it   and   i   don   t   think   that   now .   it   s   very   easy   to   use .   has   3   different   heat   settings .   has   a   low   and   a   high   speed .   the   cord   keeper   feature   is   great ,   saves   a   lot   of   space .   i   d   recommend   this   hair   dryer .
professional   hair   dryer   i   thought   i   could   never   replace   my   baby   bliss   professional   however ,   this   product   has   taken   the   lead .
just   what   my   wife   wanted   my   wife   got   to   try   this   product   out   at   a   friend   s   house   and   feel   in   love   with   it   after   1   use .   the   price   seemed   a   little   steep   but   after   the   purchase   it   was   well   worth   it .   it   takes   her   a   fraction   of   the   time   to   blow   dry   her   hair .   this   thing   gets   hot   fast   without   heating   up   the   bathroom   too   much .   the   massive   output   of   heat   really   dries   her   hair   quickly   and   keeps   her   from   being   in   a   hot   room   and   getting   sweaty   just   to   dry   her   hair   like   the   last   hair   dryer   did .   i   ve   never   seen   or   heard   of   a   better   hair   dryer ,   a   definite   buy !   colors   may   vary   it   seems   there   is   either   red   on   black ,   or   black   on   black  
a   real   good   one   has   everithing   i   was   waiting   for .   it   s   a   valuable   item .   sincerely   i   am   very   happy   with   this   product
quite   disappointed   i   bought   this   dryer   being   excited   about   the   compact   size   and   the   1875w .   in   using   it   for   the   last   couple   of   months ,   the   force   of   air   flow   has   weakened   substantially   to   the   point   where   i   need   to   purchase   another   dryer .   my   obvious   choice   will   not   be   this   one .   it   appears   to   have   a   plastic   fan   which   may   limit   its   longevity .   also ,   the   wide   opening   on   the   blower   end   makes   it   harder   to   focus   on   a   particular   area   making   it   difficult   to   control   what   section   of   hair   is   styled   and   what   s   not .   in   the   past ,   the   dryers   i   have   purchased   lasted   at   least   a   couple   of   years .   this   one   was   a   great   disappointment !
buyer   beware ! ! !   i   have   always   used   relatively   inexpensive   hair   dryers   and   have   never   had   one   break .   i   splurged   over   150   for   a   bespoke   dryer   and   the   thing   burned   out   before   i   even   had   it   for   a   year   and   i   don   t   even   use   it   once   daily   .   it   literally   sets   off   the   smoke   alarm   when   i   use   it .   had   to   throw   it   out .   what   a   total   waste   of   money .   and   forget   any   warranty   they   don   t   stand   by   their   product .
conair   225   hairdryer   my   old   conair   died   so   i   read   all   the   reviews   and   decided   on   this   hairdryer .   very   satisfied .   the   weight   is   good ,   the   attachments   are   fine ,   and   the   price   was   right !   you   don   t   need   anything   better .   i   really   like   the   ability   to   open   the   cover   to   get   to   the   mesh   filter   to   clean   it   and   the   3   heat   settings   and   3   blower   settings .   a   winner !
old   unauthorized   stock ,   but   great   deal   if   i   have   this   right ,   this   is   an   older ,   closeout   version   of   the   current   300   evolution   hairdryer   but   for   the   price   it   s   a   great   deal .   it   is   not   the   identical   model   to   the   current   one ,   as   it   only   has   1600   watts   vs .   2000   watts   for   the   current   one .   but ,   look   at   it   this   way ,   you   could   buy   3   of   these   for   the   same   price   as   the   one   from   an   authorized   dealer   with   a   warranty   and   you   would   still   have   to   pay   15   to   have   it   fixed   if   it   breaks   under   the   warranty .   the   one   we   got   came   with   no   serial   number   as   described   in   other   reviews   below ,   but   it   has   been   working   extremely   well   and   as   advertised   in   that   it   dries   hair   significantly   faster   than   our   old   conair   yellowbird   2000   watt   and   leaves   your   hair   feeling   much   softer .   i   d   rather   pay   100   with   no   warranty   than   300   with   one   that   s   like   spending   200   on   an   extended   warranty   .
great   little   dryer   we   wanted   something   that   our   children   could   use   since   we   have   very   limited   counter   space   in   the   bathroom .   so   far ,   it   s   been   just   what   we   needed .   and ,   it   is   much   more   quiet   than   hotel   wall   mounts   we   have   used .
elchim   hairdryer   hairdryer   is   heavier   than   i   m   used   to .   controls   are   on   handle   and   in   the   way .   otherwise ,   it   is   just   a   hairdryer ,   no   better   or   worse   than   others .   could   ve   spent   less   with   same   results .   was   disappointed   after   reading   all   the   reviews .   will   keep   it   until   it   stops   working .
works   well ,   reduces   frizz   for   its   price ,   it   is   a   good   deal .   dries   hair   nicely   and   quickly .   the   ion   feature   works   it   makes   the   hair   shinier   and   less   frizzy .   overall   a   good   investment   to   manage   your   hair .
good   hairdryer   this   hair   dryer   works   great .   i   did   have   a   problem   with   the   shipping   though .   it   got   lost   in   the   mail   and   then   arrived   damaged .   the   new   one   is   quiet   and   dries   my   hair   quicker   than   my   old   one .   my   hair   stylist   says   that   this   brand   of   hair   dryers   tend   to   take   a   while   to   warm   up   but   i   have   not   noticed   this   so   far .
love   it !   i   love   this   dryer .   it   dries   your   hair   faster   as   it   claims   and   is   light   weight   for   holding .   so   far   so   good .
conair   full   size   hair   dryer   works   great .   easy   to   use .   not   too   noisy .   ample   air   flow .   ionic   is   a   recent   buzzboard   that   proposes   this   technology   reduces   frizzies   i   don   t   see   a   difference   compared   to   old   school   hair   dryer .
i   m   buying   a   backup   unit .   i   ve   been   using   an   andis   prostyle   1600   hair   dryer   for   10   or   more   years .   for   me   it   is   perfect .   the   most   important   feature   for   me   is   that   i   can   drop   the   heat   1   setting   and   still   keep   the   fan   on   high .   it   is   light   weight ,   blows   lots   of   air ,   and   is   inexpensive .   mine   is   still   going   strong ,   but   i   m   buying   a   backup   to   replace   it   for   when   it   dies ,   as   all   hairdryers   eventually   do .
tourmaline   blow   dryer   from   herstyler   my   wife   loves   this   blow   dryer   so   much   that   she   wanted   me   to   buy   one   for   our   daughter   too !   excellent   price   for   excellent   product !
hello   kitty   hair   dryer   my   sister   had   a   hair   dryer   just   like   this   one   and   it   broke .   she   had   purchased   it   at   target   but   it   was   no   longer   available .   i   found   it   on   amazon   and   bought   it   for   her .   it   was   just   what   she   was   looking   for !
i   expected   it   to   last   longer .   i   did   enjoy   the   hair   dryer   very   much   when   it   worked !   i   have   very   curly   hair   and   it   used   to   dry   my   hair   very   fast   with   a   nice   shine   and   no   frizz . i   used   it   for   maybe   10   times   in   a   yr   and   it   stopped   working ,   it   only   blows   cold   air .   i   have   had   a   conair   hair   dryer   that   i   bought   for   25.00   5   yrs   ago   and   it   still   works .
company   won   t   honor   warranty   when   registering   product   bought   the   hairdryer   for   my   wife .   she   was   very   happy   with   the   performance .   when   i   went   to   register   the   product   i   couldn   t   because   the   sticker   on   the   box   that   has   the   serial   was   missing .   i   then   found   out   through   amazon   that   they   are   not   a   authorized   reseller   therefore   company   won   t   honor   warranty   if   something   happens .
great   if   it   didn   t   break   i   bought   this   for   my   wife   who   liked   it ,   until   it   stopped   working   2   monthes   after   we   got   it .   we   ll   see   how   well   they   honor   the   warranty .   it   was   a   little   heavier   than   her   past   cheap   versions ,   but   dried   faster   and   i   liked   that   it   was   much   quiter .
died   after   4   months   i   used   it   once   a   day   for   the   last   four   months   and   now   it   sounds   like   an   airplane   engine   with   hardly   any   air   flowing   out .... stay   away   from   conair ! !
happy !   i   bought   it   because   of   the   good   reviews   and   it   s   quietness .   it   s   not   as   powerful   as   the   others   i   ve   had ,   but   it   does   dry   my   hair   quicker   with   less   frizz .   i   m   happy   with   it   and   so   are   my   kids   because   it   s   quieter   than   my   previous   one .
decent   according   to   my   girlfriend   i   bought   this   for   my   girlfriend   after   seeing   it   advertised   on   tv .   it   sticks   well   to   the   mirror   but   there   is   a   problem   with   the   adjustable   arm .   according   to   my   girlfriend ,   her   hair   dryer   is   too   heavy   and   pulls   the   arm   down .   i   told   her   to   get   a   smaller   hair   dryer .   that   didn   t   go   over   well .
practical   use   i   have   been   using   wall   mounted   hair   dryers   in   hotels   for   years   and   always   threatened   to   purchase   one .   when   i   found   this   one   i   was   pleased   with   the   price ,   the   wattage   and   the   apparent   look   of   it .   when   it   arrived   i   was   very   pleased   with   how   easy   it   was   to   mount   on   the   wall   in   my   rather   small   bathroom .   i   don   t   need   a   hair   dryer   for   styling ,   just   simple   use   each   morning .   seems   to   be   working   just   fine   and   meets   my   needs .
great   hairdryer   this   dryer   works   great !   it   provides   a   nice   heat   and   it   even   has   a   lint   collector   that   can   be   taken   off   to   clean
works   well   i   have   one   of   these   hair   dryers   in   each   bathroom .   they   are   easy   to   install ,   work   well ,   and   the   night   light   is   nice   and   bright   but   not   obnoxious   .   my   wife   likes   the   power   of   this   small   dryer ,   but   if   you   ask   me   they   seem   a   bit   on   the   loud   side .   i   think   it   is   because   of   the   very   compact   design   not   enough   plastic   material   to   absorb   the   fan   noise .
stopped   working   within   months   i   liked   this   dryer   at   first ,   but   within   six   months   it   stopped   working .   it   had   a   burning   smell   inside .   dead .   i   don   t   know   about   you ,   but   i   feel   like   a   blow   dryer   should   last   longer   than   that .   and ,   who   likes   getting   stuck   without   one  
super   duper   wall   hair   dryer   excellent   product   reasonably   quiet ,   size   is   good   and   price   is   super   for   a   product   of   this   quality
i   tried   to   like   this   hair   dryer .   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   with   high   hopes   that   it   would   be   the   dryer   of   my   dreams !   not   so .   i   used   it   for   about   a   month ,   trying   to   like   it .   it   was   quiet   and   light   weight ,   but   didn   t   dry   my   hair   in   half   the   time   of   my   cheap   dryer   like   everyone   states   it   should .   it   took   about   the   same   amount   of   time   due   to   the   fact   that   it   doesn   t   have   much   blowing   power .   it   s   like   my   old   hair   dryer   on   low !   i   hated   it   so   much   i   sold   it   on   ebay   and   bought   an   elchim   2100 .   now ,   that   dryer   really   blows !   it   s   also   a   whole   lot   less   expensive   and   supposed   to   last   for   2000   hours   of   use .   at   5   minutes   of   use   per   day   yes ,   it   s   that   fast   ,   that   s   65   years !
this   dryer   blows !   what   a   powerful   hair   dryer !   it   s   a   little   heavy ,   but   it   blows   so   hard   i   can   dry   my   hair   in   3   4   minutes ,   so   i   don   t   mind .   supposed   to   last   for   2000   hours   of   use .   if   that   s   true ,   i   ll   be   dead   before   this   hair   dryer   dies !
no   nonsense   dryer   this   is   a   simple   and   effective   dryer   for   those   who   are   space   conscious   and   don   t   want   any   frills .   the   low   setting   is   only   useful   for   people   with   short   hair   as   it   is   little   more   than   a   breeze   which   works   pretty   well   for   my   hair   .   the   high   setting   is   powerful   and   would   dry   anything   but   a   wookie   in   a   fairly   short   time .   great   for   travel   as   it   is   light   and   compact .   it   does   make   a   good   bit   of   noise   on   high .   not   perfect ,   but   definitely   worth   the   price !
started   on   fire ! !   don   t   but   this   hairdryer .   i   had   mine   for   about   a   month   when   the   retractable   cord   broke ,   button ,   spring   and   all ...   and   then   this   afternoon   i   was   drying   my   hair   when   it   suddenly   turned   off   and   fire   shot   out   of   the   cord   and   melted   the   plastic   coating   and   started   smoking .   it   was   extremely   startling   and   a   huge   hazard .   now   i   am   sitting   here   with   wet   hair   and   looking   up   similar   stories   ...   please   dont   buy   this   product !
wall   mounted   hair   dryer   i   have   had   four   of   these   wall   mounted   hair   dryers   and   love   them ,   they   are   up   and   out   of   the   way   and   stay   pretty   much   un   noticable   no   fiddling   with   on   off   buttons   and   looking   for   a   place   to   store   it .   if   one   leaves   the   on   switch   on   and   hangs   it   up ,   it   goes   off   and   returns   to   the   blowing   setting   as   soon   as   one   lifts   it   again .   this   is   great .   on   a   scale   of   1   10   this   item   scores   11 .
good   hair   dryer   it   works   well ... blows   a   lot   of   air   and   it   is   not   too   hot .   it   does   sometimes   pull   my   hair   into   it   and   then   it   emits   a   burning   smell .   i   like   how   light   it   is   to   hold   as   well .   i   would   recommend   it .
great   little   hair   dryer   with   the   exception   of   the   hose   being   a   little   short   this   is   a   great   little   hair   dryer   that   has   4   temps .   it   is   light   weight   easy   to   store   and   easy   to   travel   with   i   recommend   it ! ! !
blow   drying   at   it   s   best   i   love   the   dryer ,   although   the   color   is   all   black ,   not   silver .   either   way ,   it   gives   a   silky   smooth   blow   dry .
you   wil   not   be   able   to   get   a   warranty   from   the   manufacturer   i   really   like   the   hair   dyer . it   is   light ,   drys   hair   in   half   the   time , but   i   had   no   idea   that   amazon   was   not   an   authorized   dealer .   if   you   don   t   mind   taking   the   chance   paying   100   with   no   warranty , it   s   a   great   dryer . i   think   it   is   deceptive   of   amazon   to   sell   this   product   as   new ,   and   not   let   people   know   what   they   are   getting   into .   marianne
the   best   hair   dryer !   this   dryer   exceeds   expectations .   dries   hair   fast ,   is   quiet   and   light   weight   big   plus   and   no   frizzies !   in   fact ,   sometimes   it   makes   my   hair   too   silky   so   i   have   to   use   more   harsh   shampoo   or   only   a   teenie   weenie   bit   of   conditioner .
excellent   compact   hairdryer !   i   purchased   this   for   my   sister ,   who   has   long ,   naturally   curly   and   somewhat   frizzy   hair .   she   also   has   cerebral   palsy   so   needed   a   dryer   that   was   lightweight .   this   one   fit   the   bill   she   loved   it   on   the   first   use .   her   hair   was   smooth   shiny   and   the   dryer   works   great .   a   great   value !
nice   hairdryer   i   ve   been   using   this   dryer   for   about   a   month   now .   although   the   wattage   is   less   than   my   old   hair   dryer   it   dries   my   hair   much   quicker .   my   hair   looks   smoother   and   i   barely   need   to   use   my   flat   iron   anymore .   on   off   switch   is   right   where   my   hand   goes   when   i   hold   it   with   my   left   hand   which   is   annoying ,   but   other   than   that   i   think   it   is   great .
dave1327   the   dryer   is   to   hard   to   remove   and   replace   into   it   s   cradle .   also   it   is   not   powerful   enough .
t3   says   that   amazon   not   authorized   dealer   i   was   very   angry   to   hear   that   the   t3   dryer   i   purchased   is   not   covered   under   warranty   because   i   purchased   it   through   amazon .   t3   charges   14.95   to   repair   but   wanted   to   charge   me   54.95   because   i   purchased   from   amazon .   do   not   purchase   if   you   care   about   the   warranty ,   and   you   may   need   it   as   my   dryer   stopped   working   about   16   months .
blo   and   go   woe   the   concept   was   good .   i   like   the   idea   of   hands   free   drying .   but ...   the   engineering   was   bad .   dispite   the   large   suction   cup   it   still   fell   off   of   my   mirror .   so   i   stuck   it   to   the   sink .   it   fell   over   and   the   dryer   hit   the   6   foot   mirror   over   my   sink .   thought   it   was   a   gonner   but   turned   out   ok .   i   still   stick   it   on   the   sink   but   position   it   so   that   if   it   falls   it   will   not   damage   anything   in   its   path .   maybe   if   i   could   attach   it   permanently   to   the   wall ! ! !
don   t   waste   your   money !   i   agree   with   the   first   review ,   i   bought   the   same   dryer   and   it   only   lasted   for   eight   weeks .   it   began   fizzing   and   spewing   sparks   very   scary   for   a   hair   dryer .   do   not   waste   your   money   on   this   brand   it   s   very   low   quality   and   not   worth   the   investment .
good   product ,   but   care   needed   with   power   cord   i   purchased   this   dryer   about   3   4   years   ago .   i   have   very   long   hair   below   my   waist   and   it   worked   just   fine   for   me .   the   ion   feature   makes   a   huge   difference   in   the   condition   of   my   hair .   less   frizz   and   less   tangling .   the   other   day   i   was   putting   it   away   and   noticed   a   crack   in   the   cord   s   plastic   insulation .   when   i   flexed   the   cord   after   it   was   unplugged   at   the   crack   the   insulation   completely   separated   exposing   the   wires .   further   inspection   showed   cracks   in   the   insulation   every   where   the   cord   had   been   bent   when   stored .   normally   we   are   very   careful   to   stow   appliance   cords   by   folding   accordian   style   and   using   velcro   to   hold   in   place .   for   my   new   hair   dryer   i   will   be   less   fastidious   with   the   cord   storage !   you   probably   should   inspect   the   cord   before   every   use   to   make   sure   the   insulation   is   not   cracked .   it   could   have   caused   a   fire ,   electric   shock ,   or   worse .
fantastic   product !   some   reviewers   thought   this   dryer   was   heavy   i   found   it   to   be   lightweight   but   powerful .   i   use   the   diffuser   and   was   hoping   to   purchase   an   old   fashioned   one   that   didn   t   have   fingers   however ,   this   diffuser   works   better   than   some   others   with   fingers   i   ve   used .   it   left   my   curly   hair   curly   without   frizz   like   some   older   hair   dryers .   the   only   drawback   i   can   see   is   it   s   quite   large   so   when   traveling   i   will   have   to   resort   to   my   old   fold   up   one .
don   t   do   it ! !   step   away   from   this   product   before   i   make   a   purchase   i   generally   like   to   read   the   reviews ,   but   i   do   take   them   with   grain   of   salt .   everyone   has   their   own   opinion ,   and   let   s   face   it   we   re   not   all   going   to   agree .   i   actually   have   never   felt   so   strongly   about   a   product   that   i   felt   the   need   to   write   a   review .   that   is   until   now .   i   can   t   stress   enough   how   disappointed   i   am   in   this   dryer .   i   work   hard   for   my   money   so   i   thought   long   and   hard   before   forking   out   ...   for   a   dryer   11   months   ago .   when   it   first   arrived   i   loved   it .   it   did   what   it   said   it   would ,   it   dried   my   hair   faster ,   it   was   quiet   and   lightweight .   my   friends   made   fun   of   me   for   spending   so   much ,   but   i   have   thick   hair   and   i   thought   of   it   as   an   investment .   i   purchased   it   on   february   8 ,   2008 .   today   is   january   27 ,   2009   and   my   dryer   is   broken .   it   overheats   and   sparks .   this   dryer   had   normal   use   5   or   6x   week   .   ...   .   as   if   i   m   going   to   give   them   any   more   of   my   hard   earned   money .   no   thank   you   bespoke   labs .   i   will   say   that   investing   in   a   good   dryer   is   worth   it .   ask   any   hair   stylist .   my   friend   bought   a   chi   for   about   the   same   money ,   maybe   less   i   tried   it ,   and   frankly   i   preferred   it .   it   dried   my   hair   even   faster   than   the   t3 .   for   those   of   you   who   have   and   enjoy   your   t3s ,   i   understand ,   i   did   too   for   11   months .   for   those   of   you   considering   buying   one ,   i   would   strongly   discourage   it .
wall   mounted   hair   dryer   it   is   very   handy ,   does   a   good   job   drying   my   hair .   i   liked   it   so   well   i   bought   a   second   one   for   the   other   bathroom .
simply   the   best   this   is   by   far   the   best   blow   dryer   i   have   ever   owned .   i   used   to   swear   by   the   chi   but   this   one   is   not   even   comparable !   very   happy   with   it !
worth   it   it   dries   my   hair ,   and   i   have   noticed   a   lot   less   frizzies   and   fly   aways   since   i   started   using   it .   the   cord   is   on   the   short   side ,   i   d   say   maybe   4   5   feet   long   when   stretched .   the   color   is   pretty   much   exactly   as   it   looks   in   the   picture ,   definetly   pink .   the   cool   air   function   is   very   nice   to   have .   it   s   light   weight   and   fits   in   my   hand   very   comfortably .   it   s   not   too   loud .   all   in   all ,   does   what   it   is   supposed   to   do   in   a   quick   and   comfortable   fashion .   i   definetly   recommend   this   to   anyone   willing   to   dry   their   hair   within   a   few   feet   of   the   outlet   they   plug   it   into !
bespoke   labs   hair   dryer   i   m   really   happy   with   this   product .   my   hair   is   much   smoother   and   feels   healthier .   i   would   definitely   recommend   this   item ,   but   couldn   t   imagine   paying   full   price   for   it !   a   300   hairdryer   would   have   to   come   with   it   s   own   stylist   to   be   worth   it !
handy .... exactly   what   i   wanted   if   you   enjoy   the   convenience   of   a   wall   mounted   air   dryer   when   you   travel .... why   not   have   the   same   at   home   !   this   mounted   unit   keeps   my   sink   area   uncluttered .   it   is   attractive ... works   well   and   out   of   the   way .
quality !   wouldn   t   pay   full   retail   for   it .. because   i   personally   can   not   afford   to   pay   full   retail   but   i   believe   it   s   safe   to   say   that   this   is   absolutly   one   of   the   best   if   not   the   best   hairdryer   out   there .   very   pretty   with   the   jewel   studded   handle .   powerful , light , quiet   and   pretty   much   does   everything   it   claims   to   do .   i   can   easily   see   how   this   can   be   a   favorite   of   the   worlds   top   stylists .   at   the   price   i   got   it   for   on   amazon   website   i   am   very   pleased !   you   won   t   be   dissappointed   with   it .
two   settings   too   high   and   too   low   i   am   getting   the   funny   smell   on   high   as   others   have   described .   in   addition   to   the   high   heat   setting   possibly   being   too   much   for   the   hardware   to   handle ,   it   s   also   hotter   than   i   can   handle .   the   fan   speed   and   temperature   are   linked ,   as   there   is   only   one   switch .   the   low   speed   is   too   low ,   but   you   have   to   use   high   heat   to   use   the   higher   speed .
great   dryer   worth   the   money ! ! !   have   not   bought   a   new   hair   dryer   in   years   and   was   quite   happy   with   this   purchase .
good   buy   this   dryer   was   very   cheap   but   not   cheap   made .   it   works   alot   better   then   i   expected . very   good   buy .   i   would   recommend .
burned   out   within   months   i   was   excited   to   get   this   hairdryer   as   we   have   no   space   in   our   tiny   bathroom   to   store   a   bigger   hairdryer .   i   ve   used   wall   mounted   hairdryers   in   hotels   and   thought   that   it   would   be   the   solution   for   me .   wrong !   while   it   s   great   to   have   it   up   on   the   wall   and   out   of   the   way ,   the   small   size   makes   it   better   suited   to   short   hair .   with   longer   hair   you   have   to   be   careful   to   hold   the   dryer   farther   away   from   your   head   so   that   hair   doesn   t   get   sucked   into   the   back   of   it .   i   believe   this   is   what   caused   my   hairdryer   to   start   overheating   after   just   two   months   of   use .   the   fan   became   very   sluggish   and   the   coils   would   overheat ,   then   it   would   spark   and   the   thermostat   would   reset .   the   fan   would   speed   up   within   a   few   minutes   to   where   it   could   keep   the   coils   from   overheating ,   but   eventually   this   took   even   longer .   i   took   it   apart   to   clean   it   but   it   is   made   in   such   a   way   that   you   can   t   get   at   the   hair   that   is   wrapped   around   the   fan   stem .   i   could   see   that   it   was   only   a   few   strands   anyway ,   but   even   this   was   too   much .   even   when   it   was   new   it   didn   t   blow   a   lot   of   air ,   though   it   did   get   fairly   hot .   i   m   off   to   buy   a   full   size   hairdryer   with   more   power   and   will   just   have   to   figure   out   a   place   to   hang   it .   blah .   p . s .   the   nightlight   is   really ,   really   bright .   i   disabled   mine   after   a   couple   of   nights   of   trying   to   ignore   the   green   glow   emanating   from   the   bathroom .
great   hangup   hair   dryer   ! !   this   andis   30970 ,   was   a   wonderful   purchase .   good   size ,   good   heat   temperature ,   easy   to   install   and   the   cord   hanger   goes   on   either   the   right   or   left   side .   i   have   had   other   wall   mounted   dryers ,   they   were   hard   to   hang ,   the   andis   was   up   in   a   matter   of   minutes .
i   have   one   of   these   in   every   restroom   of   the   house !   great   convenience .   being   able   to   have   a   blow   dryer   at   hand ,   rather   than   stuffed   in   some   drawer   or   cabinet ,   makes   the   morning   routine   so   much   easier .   one   tip ... to   prevent   overheating ,   do   occasionally   remove   the   screen   from   the   back   of   the   dryer .   once   the   screen   has   been   removed ,   built   up   lint   can   be   accessed   and   cleaned   easily .
t   3   bespoke   hair   dryer   fast ,   lightweight   and   durable .   this   is   the   best   hair   dyer   ever .   not   only   does   my   hair   dry   in   half   the   time   it   also   looks   shinny   and   healthy .   i   love   this   hairdryer !
junk ! ! !   i   bought   the   conair   pro   style   1875   dryer   about   6   months   ago .   i   rarely   used   it ,   but   lately   since   i   ve   been   trying   to   save   money ,   i   ve   started   to   do   my   own   hair   at   home .   that   is   when   i   discovered   that   this   dryer   was   just   a   waste   of   space   in   the   top   of   my   closet .   it   barely   dries   my   hair ,   but   it   will   burn   a   hole   in   at   the   top   of   my   scalp !   i   am   constantly   moving   my   head   left   to   right   so   that   the   heat   can   touch   every   side   of   my   hair   all   while   running   my   fingers   through   so   the   heat   can   get   to   the   inside   of   the   hair .   it   s   just   too   much   work   done   on   my   part ! ... and   that   s   not   the   worst   part   the   dryer   is   constantly   collapsing   on   my   head ! !   not   once ,   not   twice ,   but   all   the   time   i   m   under   the   dryer .   so   while   i   m   twisting   my   head   and   separating   my   hair   with   one   hand ,   i   m   holding   the   bonnet   up   with   the   other .   please   do   no   waste   your   money   on   this   product ! !
definitely   lightest   dryer   i   ever   used   this   dryer   is   by   far   the   lightest   i   have   used .   it   does   the   job   but   does   not   dry   hair   any   faster   than   my   chi .   it   actually   takes   longer   but   i   do   notice   a   little   less   frizz .   if   you   are   looking   for   less   stress   on   your   arm   and   neck   i   recommend   trying   this .
funny   name ,   good   product   i   bought   this   for   my   wife ,   wasn   t   sure   because   as   seen   on   tv   products   are   often   very   gimicky ...   but   she   loves   it .   a   few   women   i   ve   told   about   the   gift   thought   it   was   great   too .   it   s   bulky   and   heavy ,   but   that   s   a   good   sign   that   it   s   built   well   and   will   last .   the   suction   cup   was   large ,   but   it   has   fallen   down   once .   because   of   it   s   size   and   weight ,   attaching   it   and   pulling   it   off   the   mirror   every   time   you   use   it   is   not   an   option ,   but   it   s   a   little   scary   leaving   it   up   all   the   time .   tip ,   don   t   put   anything   expensive   underneath   it   .   better   tip   thoroughly   clean   mirror   and   blo   and   go   with   alcohol   before   application .   i   wish   this   came   with   an   option   to   attach   securly   to   wall   with   screws .   the   image   shows   it   attached   to   a   wall   or   a   door ,   but   i   highly   doubt   it   could   do   that ...   needs   a   completely   clean   flat   surface   like   glass .   other   than   that ,   i   am   satisfied .
christmas   gift   for   granddaughter   she   asked   for   a   colorful   hairdryer   to   take   back   to   texas   a   and   m .   this   one   has   a   beautiful   glittery   finish ,   while   also   being   a   very   good   one .   she   rally   did   like   it !
great   but   does   not   hold   up ! !   i   purchased   two   of   these   dryers .   one   dryer   glowed   red   hot   after   8   months .   i   threw   it   out .   i   purchased   another   one   and   the   plastic   tabs   that   hold   the   dryer   on   the   base   broke .   customer   service   was   horrible ! ! !   they   practically   accused   me   of   breaking   it   myself .   the   representative   said   that   she   owned   one   and   my   problem   never   happened   to   her .   anyway ,   after   calling   back   i   spoke   with   another   woman   who   said   to   mail   the   dryer   at   my   expense   9.00   and   they   would   send   me   another   dryer .   well   i   received   the   dryer   yesterday ,   plugged   it   in   and   the   plug   popped   and   blew   the   circuit   in   the   bathroom .   i   am   almost   certain   they   sent   a   refurbished   piece   of   junk ! ! !   buyer   beware !
best   hair   dryer   i   ever   owned .   it   looks   good ,   light   in   weight ,   very   powerful ,   makes   my   hair   shine .   these   new   tourmaline   ceramic   dryers   are   not   always   what   they   advertise   to   be ,   but   this   dryer   is   everything   it   says   it   is   and   more .   it   cost   a   little   more ,   but   it   is   worth   every   penny .
nice   full   sized   dryer ,   also   folds   for   travel   very   nice   dryer .   larger   sized   travel .   nice   power   doesn   t   frizz   my   hair   like   my   old   dryer   did .   happier   with   a   full   sized   travel   than   the   compact   ones ...   dries   hair   faster   without   the   frizz !
powerful ,   easy   to   install   but   ....   overall   a   good   product .   has   a   powerful   motor   in   a   very   compact   form .   no   problems   installing   holder   and   have   had   no   problems   with   unit .   there   are   only   2   settings ,   1   low   and   no   heat ,   and   1   high   with   heat .   however ,   my   wife   says   the   heat   setting   is   not   that   warm   so   factor   that   in .   if   you   want   real   heat ,   this   may   not   be   unit   for   you .
fake   don   t   buy   this   product !   it   is   not   from   an   auth   dealer .   amazon   put   up   a   fight   when   i   returned   it   and   it   somehow   it   got   lost   in   the   mail   so   they   didnt   refund   me .   seriously   don   t   get   sucked   in .
fantastic !   i   really   love   this   blowdryer .   it   really   does   eliminate   frizz .   i   m   not   sure   if   my   hair   really   is   healthier ,   but   it   definitely   looks   like   it   is !
works   great   and   it   s   worth   every   penny   i   don   t   typically   like   to   spend   110   on   a   hair   dryer .   but ,   i   would   spend   double   for   this   one .   it   drys   my   hair   quickly   without   frizzing   it .   since   i   ve   started   using   this   dryer ,   i   don   t   need   to   use   a   flattner .   my   hair   is   already   smooth   after   the   dry .   this   is   going   to   prevent   a   lot   of   damage   on   my   hair .   maybe   i   ll   be   albe   to   grow   it   out   now .   the   one   flaw ,   is   the   dryer   makes   an   occasional   rattle .   it   sounds   like   a   screw   is   loose .   but ,   if   it   breaks ,   i   ll   buy   another .
compact   and   easy   as   a   woman   with   long   hair ,   i   need   a   good   hair   dryer   that   is   easy   to   move   around   my   head .   this   one   fills   the   bill !   with   a   retractable   cord   it   makes   for   eash   storage .   it   also   dries   hair   quickly   and   is   easy   to   use   with   your   styling   brushes .
no   serial   number   t3   dryer   i   ordered   a   t3   dryer   from   amazon   because   i   had   one   previously   and   really   like   it .   i   just   tried   to   register   the   dryer   and   realized   there   was   no   serial   number   on   the   cord .   i   should   have   read   the   reviews   because   i   see   several   other   people   have   had   the   same   problem .   disappointed   about   this .   you   think   you   are   getting   a   good   price   and   then   find   out   maybe   in   the   long   run   your   not .
good   deal .   this   hair   dryer   works   well .   it   s   much   quieter   than   most   dryers   i   ve   used ,   which   is   great ,   because   i   always   worry   about   damaging   my   hearing   with   daily   use .   so   it   s   great   not   having   to   have   to   worry   about   that .   some   people   talk   about   how   heavy   it   feels ,   but   i   don   t   really   notice .   i   do   visit   the   gym   every   once   in   while ,   so   there   you   go .   i   thought   the   silvery   front   part   of   the   dryer   was   going   to   be   metal ,   but   it   s   a   dull   plastic .   that   makes   it   look   quite   a   bit   cheaper   than   pictured .   it   still   works   great   nonetheless .   it   dries   faster   than   my   other   dryer .   i   really   like   all   of   the   settings   warm   hot   and   cool   button   ,   low   high .   as   far   as   the   shininess   i   didn   t   notice   a   difference .   but   i   definitely   had   less   static   and   fly   aways .   it   comes   with   a   diffuser   and   another   part   which   you   can   snap   on ,   which   i   m   pretty   sure   is   for   blowing   your   hair   out .   all   in   all ,   this   hair   dryer   is   a   good   deal   for   the   price .   i   think   it   s   cheaper   here   on   amazon   than   walmart .   at   my   wally ,   there   were   selling   it   for   20   and   i   got   it   for   10   here .
good   value   perfect   for   travel !   on   a   recent   trip   one   of   our   hotels   had   this   dryer   in   the   room   and   my   wife   liked   it   so   much   i   ordered   one .   now   it   s   her   favorite .
great   product   this   hair   dryer   has   a   large   hood   so   i   can   use   fat   curlers .   it   is   easy   to   set   up   and   is   not   as   noisy   as   some   dryers   i   have   used .   it   is   light   weight   and   very   stable   when   set   up .   it   is   a   great   product   for   the   price .
excellent   i   used   this   product   in   a   hotel   on   vacation .   i   loved   it   so   much ,   that   is   why   i   purchased   this   one .   it   is   a   fabulous   hair   dryer .
convenient   hair   dryer   i   mainly   purchased   this   hair   dryer   to   bring   some   order   into   our   bathroom .   a   bit   more   expensive   than   a   standard   hair   dryer   i . e .   just   a   dryer   with   a   cord   ,   but   worth   it .   the   dryer   was   easy   to   mount   on   the   wall .   the   cord   dryer   now   stay   out   of   way ,   and   the   night   light   sufficient   to   light   that   way   in   the   middle   of   the   night   is   a   nice   bonus .   of   course ,   the   dryer   does   a   good   job   as   well .   i   can   recommend   this   product .   update   1   year   later ,   works   great .   bought   a   2nd   one .
a   must   have !   a   must   have   for   freezy   curly   unruly   hair   , makes   blow   drying   a   breeze , i   purchased   one   about   12   years   ago ... still   going   strong ! i   use   it   every   day , also   for   touch   ups ,   so   i   ve   decided   to   get   a   new   one   for   my   daughter   that   will   graduate   college   just   in   case   she   decides   to   move   out ...   , fairly   light , right   price , and   combined   with   amazon   service   and   reliability ......... priceless   , go   for   it   , you   will   not   regret   it .
do   not   buy   this   product ! ! ! !   this   hair   dryer   does   nothing   to   your   hair   but   leave   it   frizzy   and   not   completely   dry ! ! ! !   and   it   constantly   cuts   off   this   started   on   the   second   use   so   the   vent   could   not   have   been   clogged   enough   to   cause   this .   invest   in   a   nicer   dryer   if   you   want   your   hair   to   look   right ! ! ! !   i   am   definitely   going   to   try   to   return   mine   to   the   store ... it   really   sucks ! ! !
powerful   little   dryer   i   had   a   smaller   travel   conair   for   years   and   it   just   died .   i   needed   to   make   sure   the   next   one   was   up   to   speed .   this   little   dryer   is   perfect .   i   have   long   hair   and   i   don   t   like   to   spend   a   ton   of   time   drying   my   hair ,   so   i   need   something   powerful .   i   use   this   dryer   as   my   everyday   hair   dryer ,   it   s   small   size   makes   it   easy   to   store   and   also   not   heavy   to   hold   so   your   arm   doesn   t   get   sore .   br   also   comes   with   a   switch   so   that   you   can   adjust   the   voltage   if   you   travel   abroad .   very   handy .   br   highly   recommend   this   hair   dryer !
lasted   1.5   years   hair   dryer   stopped   working   after   about   a   year   a   half   of   use .   worked   great   until   one   day ,   it   stopped   working   altogther .   kind   of   expected   to   be   able   to   use   this   for   a   longer   period   of   time .   perhaps   my   expectations   are   too   high   !
decent   hairdryer   i   have   very   curly   hair   am   used   to   blow   drying   it   straight   have   been   doing   it   for   10   years   and   using   a   flat   iron   to   get   it   frizz   free .   this   hairdryer   is   not   as   good   as   most   of   the   reviews   made   it   seem   the   nozzle   only   covers   a   small   area ,   and   i   still   need   to   use   a   flat   iron .   however ,   the   hairdryer   is   powerful   it   cut   5   minutes   off   my   hair   drying   time   20   min   down   to   15   .   another   plus   is   that   it   is   quieter   than   most .
great   product   we   ve   owned   one   of   these   before   and   loved   it .   it   hangs   on   the   wall   in   our   bathroom   so   it   s   always   handy .   when   the   first   one   broke   my   wife   had   to   go   back   to   the   bulky   old   one   she   had   until   i   found   this   on   amazon .   easiest   way   to   make   a   wife   happy !
good   hair   dryer   with   some   minor   flaws   this   is   a   good   little   basic   hair   dryer .   i   don   t   do   anything   fancy   with   my   hair   and   it   suits   my   purposes   great .   i   have   short ,   curly   hair   that   i   straighten   and   this   blow   dryer   does   a   nice   job   of   straightening   when   i   have   the   attachment   on .   also ,   if   i   decide   to   leave   my   hair   curly   i   can   take   the   attachment   off   and   do   the   whole   scrunch   thing   and   my   hair   looks   great .   it   is   definitely   worth   what   i   paid   for   it .   i   have   a   small   bathroom   and   i   really   like   its   compact   size   and   that   it   folds   up .   the   hot   dries   really   fast   and   i   like   the   cold   blast   feature .   that   said ,   the   high   low   on   off   switch   drives   me   insane .   if   my   hands   are   a   little   bit   wet   which   given   that   i   m   drying   wet   hair   they   often   are   i   have   a   hard   time   getting   a   grip   on   the   switch   with   my   thumb   and   getting   it   turned   off   and   on .   also ,   it   seems   like   the   nozzle   doesn   t   attach   100   maybe   about   95   so   it   just   falls   off   sometimes   while   i   m   drying   my   hair .   by   this   time   the   nozzle   is   really   hot   so   i   have   to   wait   for   it   to   cool   before   i   can   put   it   back   on   to   finish   drying   my   hair .   but   for   what   i   paid   for   it ,   it   is   definitely   worth   it .
beware   warranty   not   honored   beware   i   purchased   this   item   just   over   4   months   ago   and   am   recently   having   some   problems   with   it   working   properly .   it   starts   off   really   slow   on   high ,   and   often   doesn   t   get   up   to   speed   like   it   did   before .   it   also   smells   like   something   is   burning   when   i   first   turn   it   on .   i   called   bespoke   labs   to   get   it   replaced   and   was   told   that   amazon . com   is   not   an   authorized   online   seller   and   therefore   they   will   not   honor   the   1   year   warranty .   bespoke   will   only   replace   the   broken   hairdryer   for   an   additional   55   plus   i   have   to   ship   it   back   to   them   in   ca .   while   i   loved   the   hair   dryer ,   i   m   not   willing   to   sink   another   55   in   to   it .   besides ,   who   knows   if   the   next   one   will   work .
be   aware   product   without   warranty   if   bought   here   in   order   to   register   this   product   and   receive   the   factory   warranty ,   there   is   a   label   on   the   box   that   says   we   need   to   find   a   silver   decal   on   the   cord   of   the   product .   after   an   exaustive   search ,   i   figured   out   that   amazon . com   is   not   an   authorized   reseller   and   we   do   not   qualify   for   a   warranty ...   even   worse ,   they   say   that   the   product   may   be   temperad   or   fake .   br   br   i   confess   i   am   pretty   sad   with   that .
t3   bespoke   labs   83808   se   featherweight   professional   ionic   ceramic   tourmaline   hair   dryer   i   love   this   blow   dryer !   the   first   time   i   used   it   i   couldn   t   believe   how   much   volume   and   thickness   i   had   in   my   usually   limp   hair !   i   rarely   have   to   use   a   curling   iron   now   because   my   frizzy   ends   have   disappeared .   definitely   worth   the   investment .
works   well   but   only   for   a   while   i   bought   this   5   months   ago ,   and   it   croaked .   just   like   that , it   starting   to   smell   burned   w   o   smoke   and   then   it   stopped .   it   wasn   t   the   socket ,   it   was   the   dryer .   too   bad   it   was   a   good   price   and   it   when   it   worked ,   it   worked   well .   the   best   part   about   it   was   the   retractable   cord .... next !   go   for   a   brand   name   like   conair   or   sasson .   their   dryers   last .
worked   good   until   it   broke ..   i   really   liked   how   this   dryer   worked .   it   produced   a   good   stream   of   nicely   heated   air   and   seemd   to   dry   my   hair   fairly   well .   however   after   3   months   of   normal   use   used   it   once   a   day   for   about   5   7   days   a   week   .   it   suddenly   stopped   producing   hot   air .   very   disappointed ...
get   the   sunbeam   oster   instead   i   used   a   sunbeam   wall   mount   dryer   for   many   years .   when   it   died ,   i   looked   to   find   a   replacement ,   but   saw   that   sunbeam   had   changed   the   design   a   bit .   fearing   that   they   might   have   ruined   the   classic   model ,   i   bought   this   one   instead   because   it   looked   in   the   picture   like   the   former   sunbeam   design .   what   a   mistake .   the   jerdon   is   clearly   a   poor   knockoff   of   the   original   sunbeam .   it   s   bulkier   and   heavier .   the   catches   that   clip   in   the   handset   part   don   t   latch   positively   like   the   sunbeam   did .   just   about   everything   about   this   dryer   seems   inferior   to   the   sunbeam .   the   only   thing   that   some   people   might   like   better   is   the   heat   level .   this   thing   is   hot !   if   you   re   one   who   likes   to   start   the   day   with   a   singe   on   your   scalp ,   this   is   the   dryer   for   you !   in   fact ,   the   dryer   is   so   hot ,   it   caught   on   fire   after   we   owned   it   less   than   a   year !   so   here   i   am   on   amazon   again   to   buy   another   dryer .   but   this   time ,   i   ll   do   the   right   thing   and   get   the   1632   instead !
do   not   purchase   this   item   i   purchased   this   product   in   september .   when   i   got   it   i   was   so   dissapointed   to   find   out   how   loud   and   heavy   this   thing   was .   this   thing   is   so   loud   that   i   have   been   asked   by   a   family   member   to   find   somewhere   else   to   blowdry   my   hair   because   it   wakes   them   up   in   the   next   room   over   and   trust   me ,   they   are   not   light   sleepers   !   after   a   few   weeks   of   use ,   the   dryer   cut   out   while   i   was   half   way   done   drying   my   hair   and   would   not   turn   back   on   for   roughly   10   minutes .   i   thought   perhaps   it   was   a   fluke   thing .   nope !   just   over   another   month   passed   and   the   dryer   began   to   spark   from   the   inside   and   was   glowing   for   about   2   minutes ,   when   all   of   a   sudden   it   stoped   glowing   and   would   not   blow   any   hot   air .   this   dryer   overheats   like   nothing   i   have   ever   seen .   this   thing   is   awful .   i   am   so   dissapointed   because   the   last   hairdryer   i   owned   was   an   andis   as   well   and   it   was   amazing !   it   lasted   me   just   over   5   years ,   was   super   quiet ,   lightweight   and   wonderful .   do   not   buy   this   item !
great   dryer   and   love   the   folding   handle !   this   is   a   great   hair   dryer .   i   love   the   retractable   cord   and   the   folding   handle   makes   it   great   for   travel .   the   1875   watts   of   power   dry   the   wet   hair   quickly   and   i   don   t   have   any   frizz   problems .   other   hair   dryers   don   t   seem   to   put   out   as   much   hot   air   so   i   really   like   this   one   for   the   nice   blast   of   heated   air .   i   ve   not   had   any   problems   with   the   cord   and   it   s   lightweight   and   easy   to   maneuver .   br   recommended !
excellent   travel   dryer !   this   dryer   is   perfect   for   travel .   it   is   not   tiny ,   like   some   travel   dryers ,   but   is   smaller   than   the   normal   hair   dryer .   the   pullout   cord   is   extra   long ,   the   handle   folds   for   packing ,   it   is   powerful ,   and   uses   the   ionic   technology .   it   is   perfect   for   me .   i   love   that   it   is   black   and   silver   with   the   black   part   having   a   rubbery   coating   that   keeps   it   from   sliding   off   the   countertop .   excellent   product !
excellent   product   i   bought   this   dryer   after   much   debate   over   its   price   about   a   month   ago .   i   had   decided   the   price   was   worthwhile   given   how   much   more   expensive   it   is   at   regular   stores   in   the   mall   compared   to   amazon .   although   it   is   still   on   the   pricey   side ,   i   feel   this   was   an   excellent   investment .   br   br   i   have   fairly   long   hair   that   i   blowdry   every   morning ,   and   this   dryer   really   does   speed   up   that   process .   it   s   true   that   the   dryer   doesn   t   seem   to   blow   with   much   force ,   or   with   much   heat ,   but   it   actually   dries   my   hair   much   faster   than   any   of   my   old   brands   conair ,   vidal   sassoon   with   less   noise   and   without   me   working   up   a   sweat .   br   br   i   m   not   sure   if   it   indeed   makes   your   hair   smoother   or   shinier ...   i   have   straight   hair   as   is .   but   coworkers   and   friends   have   been   commenting   a   lot   lately   on   how   healthy   my   hair   has   been   looking   since   i   starting   using   it .   br   br   i   guess   the   other   comments   on   amazon   not   being   an   authorized   dealer   and   therefore   voiding   the   warranty   can   be   a   deterrant ,   but   being   able   to   save   100   compared   to   retail   was   significant   enough   for   me   to   take   a   chance   on   that .
warning !   i   have   owned   two   of   this   same   product   now .   both   have   started   to   shoot   sparks   within   less   than   one   year .   be   warned .   this   is   a   hazardous   dryer .
works   great !   i   have   short ,   thick ,   coarse   hair   and   it   dries   it   quickly .   my   bathromm   is   small   and   i   like   it   hanging   on   the   wall   within   easy   reach   since   i   have   no   drawer   space .   if   you   ve   ever   used   on   in   a   hotel ,   same   thing .
great   dryer ,   great   price   great   dryer ,   works   well .   lots   of   heat   and   volume   when   i   need   it ,   nice   cooling   button .   dries   my   hair   fast .   amazon   got   it   to   me   overnight   when   mine   died ,   so   i   only   went   1   day   with   bad   hair .   not   bad ,   because   i   don   t   have   time   to   shop   at   the   brick   and   mortar .
good   value   for   the   money   this   hairdryer   does   exactly   what   it   promises   dries   hair   fast   and   keeps   the   dryer   handy   but   neatly   out   of   the   way   all   for   under   25 !   the   only   thing   i   don   t   like   about   it   is   the   noise   it   creates .   i   wanted   to   buy   the   quiet   version ,   but   couldn   t   find   it   available   anywhere .
a   must   have   for   frizzy   troublesome   hair !   i   love   this   dryer .   i   used   a   similar   one   at   planet   hollywood   in   vegas   and   tracked   it   down   when   i   got   home .   i   have   wavy   hair   that   always   frizzes   into   a   puff   ball   when   i   use   a   hairdryer .   i   had   switched   from   my   old   dryer   to   the   remington   wet2straight   which   i   thought   was   the   greatest   invention   ever ,   but   this   dryer   quickly   replaced   it .   the   key   is   the   high   power   motor ,   it   gets   my   entire   head   dry   in   less   than   10   minutes ,   with   no   frizz .   a   quick   run   through   with   a   straightener   after   i   m   done   is   all   i   need .   plus   it   s   lightweight   and   quiet .   this   product   saves   me   at   least   15   minutes   in   the   morning   that   i   used   to   waste   getting   frustrated   with   my   hair ... try   it !
andis   micro   is   great   i   m   blown   away   literally   .   this   is   the   best   hair   dryer   i   ve   ever   owned .   compact ,   powerful ,   super   light   weight ,   dual   voltage ... for   under   15 ... are   you   kidding   me   !   flicked   the   voltage   switch   using   a   coin ,   and   it   worked   great   when   we   were   in   italy .   andis   micro   hair   dryers   rule !
worth   the   money   i   love   this   hair   dryer .   it   is   the   best   one   i   have   ever   owned   in   terms   of   making   my   fine   hair   look   amazing .   i   recommend   this   hair   dryer   to   any   one   and   be   sure   to   use   the   large   attachment   to   it   for   great   results !
best   hair   dryer   i   ve   ever   had   i   was   sick   of   buying   cheaper   dryers   and   having   them   break   after   a   year ,   so   i   decided   to   spend   more   on   something   professional .   this   hair   dryer   is   quieter   than   any   other   i   ve   used   and   dries   my   hair   in   half   the   time !   it   is   definitely   worth   the   money .   br   br   update   it   is   now   3   and   a   half   years   since   my   initial   review   and   i   am   still   extremely   pleased   with   this   hair   dryer ...   it   was   definitely   worth   the   investment !
disappointing   bought   this   hairdryer   to   replace   the   same   one   that   had   been   hanging   on   the   wall   for   10   years   and   finally   died .   was   excited   when   the   bracket   was   the   same   so   didn   t   have   to   do   anything   but   hang   it   up .. then   i   used   it .   it   doesn   t   get   hot .   blows   nice   warm   air   but   doesn   t   get   hot   enough   to   style   your   hair .   i   now   have   this   one   hanging   on   the   wall ,   unplugged ,   while   i   use   one   that   i   haul   out   of   the   drawer   every   morning .
nice !   nicest   blow   dryer   we   ve   ever   had !   actually   does   reduce   frizz   and   dries   extremely   fast .   worth   every   penny !
pleased   with   replacement   asin   b0009xh6xc   andis   33700   hangup   pro   turbo   1600w   wall   mount   hair   dryer   with   night   light   replace   a   nearly   decade   old   unit   that   just   finally   wore   out .   works   great .   wish   the   night   light   was   not   quite   so   bright .
great   hairdryer   this   is   a   great   hairdryer .   it   s   light ,   and   dries   my   hair   fast .   i   was   worried   about   frizzy   hair ,   but   the   dryer   doesn   t   make   my   hair   frizzy .
excelent   prouduct   this   is   an   excellent   prouduct .   it   eliminates   friz   and   drys   your   hair   in   half   the   time .   i   love   mine .
bespoke   t3   hair   dryer   it   s   sensational .   very   happy   with   the   price   and   service   from   the   shipper .   my   hair   has   never   been   smoother   or   shinier .
good   deal   this   blow   dryer   gets   really ,   really   hot .   it   s   a   great   product   for   a   great   price .
also   warms   toes   nicely   it   s   a   hairdryer .   it   blows   cold   air   over   a   heating   element   and   makes   it   hot .   that   hot   air   evaporates   and   carries   away   the   water   in   your   hair ,   making   it   dry .   hardly   rocket   science .   it   does   all   the   above   well .   br   br   the   ion   function   only   works   when   the   cold   blast   button   is   pressed ,   so   i   don   t   have   to   worry   about   where   all   those   extra   electrons   hangin   off   the   negative   ions   will   end   up .   br   br   the   overall   slow   speed   of   the   fan   coupled   with   the   diffuser   makes   a   nice ,   safe   warmer   for   cold   winter   feet ,   too .
wow ...   that   s   a   heck   of   a   hairdryer   let   me   just   say   this .   i   love   pink .   my   whole   room   used   to   be   painted   pink .   i   wear   pink   a   lot .   i   love   that   this   hairdryer   is   pink .   that   being   said ,   i   think   the   color   is   the   most   redeeming   quality   for   this   thing .   it   s   a   hairdryer ,   people   not   a   car .   personally ,   i   don   t   care   about   torque   or   rpm   or   whatever   fancy   gadgets   it   throws   in .   it   s   still   just   a   pink   hairdryer .   a   really ,   really   big   pink   hairdryer .   it   s   heavy ,   it   s   hefty   so   you   better   have   a   strong   grip   and   it   does   not   fold   over .   the   cord   retracts ,   but   i   repeat ,   it   does   not   fold   over .   it   does   have   variable   temps ,   which   is   nice   i   guess .   it   gets   the   job   done   but   so   does   my   small   hairdryer .   and   i   don   t   think   that   one   doubles   as   a   weapon .   and   my   arm   doesn   t   hurt   after   using   it .   there   s   some   sort   of   black ,   pointy   attachment   for   this   thing .   i   don   t   know   what   it   does .   if   you   do ,   good   for   you !   but   ya   know   what   it   s   still   a   really   big ,   really   expensive ,   pink   hairdryer .   and   i   love   pink .   and   it   gets   the   job   done .
almost   set   my   daughter   s   hair   on   fire !   i   used   the   dryer   for   about   a   year .   one   day   i   was   blow   drying   my   then   6   year   old   daughter   s   hair   when   sparks   started   flying   out   of   the   dryer .   i   freaked   out !   i   am   trying   to   get   a   replacement   but   the   company   is   giving   me   a   hard   time   because   i   bought   it   through   amazon   and   they   are   not   an   authorized   re   seller .   don   t   waste   your   money .
it   s   okay   maybe   i   bought   this   item   based   upon   the   reviews   found   here   at   amazon .   yes ,   it   is   small   and   powerful ,   easily   carried .   it   is   just   about   right ,   almost .   from   day   one   the   bearings   sound   like   they   are   going   out .   did   i   get   a   defective   unit   if   yours   sounds   like   mine ,   you   are   wondering   when   it   will   be   going   out .   but   it   still   works   so   i   keep   using   it .   does   the   going   out   sound   bother   us .   you   bet   it   does !   updated   12   30   2008   yep ,   it   did   go   out   about   a   week   ago ,   so   the   sounds   were   the   prelude   of   a   unit   wearing   itself   out .   only   lasted   several   months .
hair   dyer   the   quality   of   this   product   was   horrible .   when   you   held   it ,   you   could   feel   how   cheaply   made   it   was .   i   was   very   dissatisfied .
get   s   the   job   done !   i   ve   had   this   dryer   for   about   3   years .   the   only   thing   that   has   gone   bad   probably   due   to   abuse   is   the   bonnet .   the   string   has   broken   and   the   bonnet   itself   tore .   i   purchased   the   conair   to   replace   it ,   but   the   hose   came   apart   and   i   ended   up   giving   it   away .   i   like   the   hot   tools   so   much   that   i   ended   up   replacing   the   broken   string   and   super   gluing   the   bonnet   to   patch   up   the   hole   and   i   have   resisted   getting   a   new   dryer .   if   i   could   find   a   bonnet   replacement ,   i   would   buy   it   but   i   can   t   so   i   ll   break   down   and   get   another   unit .   i   haven   t   had   any   problems   with   it   not   fully   inflating   even   with   my   super   glued   holes   .   i   also   find   that   it   is   very   hot   and   i   sometimes   have   to   put   it   on   medium .   the   hose   is   pretty   long   and   easily   stores   inside   the   unit ,   along   with   the   bonnet .   it   s   very   portable   and   convenient .   i   usually   put   it   on   at   night   while   i   lay   on   the   couch   and   watch   tv ,   or   when   i   am   working   on   the   computer .   before   i   know   it ,   my   hair   is   dry !
this   item   has   a   few   problems   the   item   is   described   as   a   soft   bonnet   hair   dryer .   the   dryer   works ,   but   the   bonnet   is   not   at   all   soft .   it   occasionally   irritates   the   neck   because   of   stiffness   where   the   hose   joins   the   bonnet .   the   temperatures   can   get   too   hot   low   heat   is   hotter   than   my   previous   hair   dryer   ever   got   on   its   maximum   heat   setting .   watch   out !
unsatisfied   customer   i   have   curly ,   medium   length   hair . i   bought   this   dryer   in   the   begining   of   the   year   thinking   it   would   produce   less   frizz .   after   using   it   for   6   months   always   on   the   warm   settling ,   not   hot   ,   it   fried   my   hair .   my   hair   has   never   been   this   dry   and   unmanagable .   since   the   dryer   was   the   only   thing   i   changed   in   my   hair   care   regiment ,   i   figured   that   was   the   answer .   when   i   couldn   t   stand   it   any   more ,   i   started   using   my   old   non   ionic   blow   dryer .   within   two   weeks ,   i   noticed   my   hair   wasn   t   as   dry   and   frizzy .   i   hate   this   dryer   because   of   all   the   damage   it   did   to   my   hair .   and ,   although   i   did   not   experience   the   sparks ,   it   short   circuit   on   me   on   a   weekly   basis .   i   don   t   recommend   this   product   to   anyone ,   especially   for   people   with   curly ,   think   hair .
andis   hangup   dryer   looks   sharp   hanging   up .   small   and   compact   and   has   good   blowing   action .   only   fault   is   that   it   only   has   two   speeds   and   the   heat   setting   is   governed   by   the   blower   speed ,   but   that   is   minor .   would   be   nice   to   have   a   cool   shot   too .   the   cord   hangup   tab   is   a   good   idea   to   keep   the   cord   out   of   the   way .   the   dryer   fits   into   the   receiver   fine ,   but   it   seems   that   it   could   be   anchored   into   the   holder   a   little   better   as   it   feels   like   it   might   fall   out   if   bumped .   it   hasn   t   yet ,   so   it   might   just   be   my   imagination .
worked   great ... for   about   a   year   i   bought   this   a   little   over   a   year   ago ,   used   it   5   to   6   times   a   week   to   dry   my   short   hair ,   and   kept   the   dust   lint   trap   clean   regularly .   loved   this   dryer   and   it   dried   my   hair   quickly .   however ,   after   barely   a   year ,   suddenly   it   blew   nothing   hotter   than   luke   warm   air .   i   put   up   with   this   for   a   couple   of   weeks   until   one   day   it   blew   only   cold   air .   very   disappointing ,   as   i   d   really   liked   everything   else   about   this   dryer .   it   s   now   been   replaced   with   a   lesser   but   more   dependable   brand   until   i   can   find   something   comparable .   look   elsewhere   or   expect   a   limited   product   lifespan .
buyer   beware ! ! !   lasted   7   months .   in   that   7   months   it   sporatically   shuts   itself   off .   now   its   completely   dead .   the   manufacturer   won   t   warranty   it   because   amazon   is   not   an   authorized   dealer .   my   10   conair   has   lasted   at   least   15   years !   what   a   waste .
very   powerful   dryer   this   is   the   best   dryer   i   have   purchased .   i   own   about   4 ,   and   this   one   dries   my   hair   the   quickest   without   frying   it .   some   dryers   use   very   high   heat ,   but   not   enough   power .   this   dryer   is   also   not   as   heavy   as   other   ones   i   have   used .   the   price   is   good   for   the   quality .
conair   hairdryer   overall   i   do   like   my   purchase ,   it   is   as   advertized ,   i   use   this   product   every   other   day .
great   blowdryer   this   is   a   great   blowdryer .   i   had   one   before   and   this   one   is   a   little   different ,   but   it   works   great .   i   love   it !   compact   and   the   handle   folds   up   which   my   old   one   didn   t   do ,   which   is   a   great   feature   for   traveling .   high   speed   dries   hair   quickly !   very   fast   shipper   too !   thanks !   love   it !
good   on   wall   hair   dryer .   easy   to   install   on   wall   but   requires   some   drilling .   three   heat   settings   work   well   but   i   would   like   to   have   a   setting   that   is   air   only   like   my   old   dryer   had .   night   light   is   green   but   throws   enough   light   to   see   way   around   bathroom   at   night .   no   way   to   turn   night   light   off .
light   weight   dryer   the   dryer   is   very   lightweight .   however   it   did   not   have   a   serial   number   on   it   so   i   was   not   able   to   complete   the   warranty   for   it .   i   also   tend   to   hit   the   power   switch   which   accidently   turns   it   off   periodically   maybe   i   am   just   not   used   to   the   location   of   the   switch   yet   on   the   handle .
from   a   cosmotoligists   point   of   view   i   am   tired   of   paying   85   dollars   and   up   for   a   professional   hairdryer   that   never   seems   to   last   more   than   9   mos ,   is   heavy   with   a   bulky   desighn   and   never   fails   to   trip   my   breaker   usually   more   than   once   while   blow   drying   a   client .   p . s ,   stay   away   from   hot   tools ,   ive   had   3   of   them   in   2   1   2   years   the   shipping   was   fast ,   and   although   the   dryer   itself   is   of   a   smaller   scale , it   has   more   blowing   power   than   i   expected   for   its   small   size ,   its   nice   and   light   and   easy   to   handle ,   it   has   yet   to   trip   my   breaker   at   work ,   its   perfect   for   young   girls   who   are   just   learning   to   manuver   a   blowdryer , and   of   course ,   the   price   is   great ,   at   this   rate   i   could   go   through   3   a   year   and   not   spend   what   i   normally   would   on   another ............ downside   is   that   the   cord   is   short ,   its   just   a   touch   noisier   than   i   would   prefer ,   and   i   have   dropped   it   once   and   the   seam   eria   where   the   blowdryer   is   put   together   has   come   apart   a   little ,   but   its   still   running ! !   this   is   a   great   product   for   the   money ,   i   would   buy   again !
oster   wall   hair   dryer   this   is   our   third   oster   wall   hair   dryer .   we   ve   used   them   in   hotels   while   on   business   trips   and   thought   it   would   be   great   to   have   one   at   home .   we   love   these   hair   dryers   because   they   are   easy   to   use   and   efficient .   we   don   t   have   to   reach   under   the   bathroom   sink   to   pull   it   out   every   morning   or   find   a   place   to   plug   it   in   without   bumping   into   anything   else   on   the   counter .   it   takes   up   very   little   space   on   the   wall   and   is   very   easy   to   install .
this   dryer   sucks !   i   was   really   excited   when   i   bought   this   269   dryer   for   39   several   months   ago ,   but   when   i   started   using   it   i   noticed   immediately   that   it   didn   t   really   feel   like   it   was   drying   my   hair   faster .   it   actually   felt   like   it   took   longer   than   usual .   so   i   went   back   to   amazon   to   search   for   product   specifics   and   couldn   t   find   the   wattage   for   this   dryer   anywhere .   imagine   my   surprise   when   i   did   a   google   search   and   found   that   this   dryer   is   for   ethnic   hair   and   has   a   powerful   1300   watts .   powerful   1300   watts   are   you   kidding   no   wonder   it   sucks .   maybe   it   s   good   for   ethnic   hair ,   but   for   a   caucasian   girl   with   long   fine   hair   it   just   adds   about   10   minutes   to   my   drying   time .   don   t   waste   your   money   on   this   unless   you   are   looking   for   a   dryer   that   puts   out   as   much   air   as   a   floor   fan .   the   people   who   wrote   rave   reviews   on   this   must   have   been   brainwashed   by   the   deal   they   got .   no   way   would   i   ever   pay   268   for   this   dryer .   the   cheapest   wal   mart   travel   dryer   has   more   wattage   than   this !
worth   the   money   i   have   never   spent   this   much   on   a   hair   dryer   before   in   my   life .   but   one   weak   moment   i   ordered   it   and   i   am   not   sorry   one   single   bit .   in   this   case ,   you   do   get   what   you   pay   for .   it   has   a   lot   of   drying   power   but   does   not   blow   your   hair   to   the   point   it   frizzes   or   feels   really   dried   out .   first   this   threw   me   because   i   was   used   to   more   hot   air   blowing   out   but   after   i   finished   using   it   on   my   hair   for   the   first   time ,   it   was   amazing .   no   over   blowing ,   my   hair   felt   softer   and   in   better   condition ,   and   for   some   reason   straighter   and   more   styled .   no   need   to   hesitate   on   buying   this .   i   ll   never   go   back   to   a   cheaper   hair   dryer   again .   if   you   are   still   trying   to   justify   spending   the   money ,   look   at   it   as   saving   money   on   extra   conditioner   for   your   hair .   this   thing   is   wonderful .
bad   smell   when   used   on   high   it   is   compact   and   neat .   but   you   can   smell   something   bad   when   you   use   it   on   high .   it   is   fine   on   medium
powerful   and   nice   looking !   this   hairdryer   is   much   more   powerful   than   the   conair   i   previously   owned   as   it   dries   my   hair   in   nearly   half   the   time .   it   is   a   tiny   bit   quieter ,   but   still   makes   a   decent   amount   of   noise   about   the   same   as   a   powerful   hand   vacuum   .   it   is   a   perfect   size   for   any   bathroom   we   bought   a   white   one   for   one   bathroom   and   this   black   for   another   .   the   only   thing   i   would   change   is   to   make   the   power   cord   recoil   as   it   is   nice   and   long ,   but   must   be   wrapped   up   after   each   use   or   left   to   hang .   that   said ,   i   still   highly   recommend   this   hair   dryer .
powerful   little   thing !   this   hairdryer   is   much   more   powerful   than   the   conair   i   previously   owned   as   it   dries   my   hair   in   nearly   half   the   time .   it   is   a   tiny   bit   quieter ,   but   still   makes   a   decent   amount   of   noise   about   the   same   as   a   powerful   hand   vacuum   .   it   is   a   perfect   size   for   the   bathroom .   the   only   thing   i   would   change   is   to   make   the   power   cord   recoil   as   it   is   nice   and   long ,   but   must   be   wrapped   up   after   each   use   or   left   to   hang .   that   said ,   i   still   highly   recommend   this   hair   dryer .
hair   dryer   looks   silver   in   picture   but   it   s   actually   white   bought   it .   didn   t   use   it .   wanted   a   silver   one .   picture   looks   silver .   returned   it .   will   get   exactly   what   i   want   instead .
great   little   dryer !   i   have   owned   several   of   these   over   the   years   and   think   they   are   one   of   the   best   dryers   i   have   used .   they   don   t   have   a   lot   of   bells   and   whistles   just   hi   and   lo   settings   ,   but   if   you   want   a   light   and   powerful   dryer   that   doesn   t   take   up   a   lot   of   room ,   this   is   it .   also   like   the   very   compact   size   of   this   unit   you   won   t   get   arm   cramps   trying   to   hold   this   while   drying   . the   wall   mount   is   a   nice   feature .
works   great   this   dryer   dries   my   hair   in   about   half   the   time   i   used   to   5   minutes   instead   of   10   ,   and   i   am   not   drenched   in   sweat   after   using   it .   i   use   it   with   the   diffuser   t3   83807   tourmaline   diffuser   ii   ,   on   the   high   setting ,   and   keep   it   very   close   to   my   head .   it   was   pricey   but   it   was   a   good   buy .
great   hair   dryer   i   stayed   at   a   hotel   that   had   these   hair   dryers .   i   liked   it   so   much   that   i   wrote   down   the   name   and   looked   it   up .   it   is   small ,   yet   powerful ,   and   not   quite   as   noisy   as   my   previous ,   powerful   dryer .   not   disappointed   so   far .
andis   hair   dryer   install   was   easy   and   quick ,   loved   the   extra   little   arm   to   hang   up   the   excess   cord .   night   light   is   really   bright ,   i   mean   really   bright .   i   think   it   s   quiet   as   in   the   lable   is   because   of   the   lower   speed   of   the   blower   motor .   i   prefer   more   air   moving .   dryer   does   a   good   job   all   in   all .
excellent   hair   dryer   andis   blow   dryers   are   much   better   than   the   ones   you   buy   in   chain   stores .   they   dry   your   hair   much   faster   and   make   wavy   hair   easier   to   style .   the   only   problem   i   find   is   that   they   are   heavier   than   the   store   standards   and   your   arms   get   tired .   i   recommend   this   dryer   to   anyone   who   wants   great   looking   hair   fast   and   easy

andis   30230   1600w   wall   mount   hair   dryer   i   am   so   pleased   with   this   dryer .   works   great   and   is   so   handy   in   my   bathroom .   now   i   don   t   have   those   cords   hanging   all   over   and   it   doesn   t   take   up   counter   space .   very   handy .

don   t   buy   this   hairdryer   bought   this   hairdryer   a   month   ago   and   as   we   speak   it   is   in   a   landfill   somewhere .   what   a   piece   of   junk .   just   stopped   working   one   day .   would   nt   turn   on   at   all .   to   return   it   would   be   more   of   a   hassle   and   expense   than   its   worth   and   conair   knows   this   so   they   continue   to   produce   inferior   products   knowing   they   won   t   get   them   back .   the   retractable   cord   worked   when   it   felt   like   it .   don   t   waste   your   money   on   this   one .

love   this   hair   dryer !   i   purchased   this   hair   dryer   after   using   on   on   a   trip   and   it   was   the   hair   dryer   that   was   supplied   by   the   hotel .   i   love   the   way   it   doesn   t   use   a   lot   of   heat .   i   also   loved   the   way   my   hair   looked   after   using   this   product ,   the   ends   of   my   hair   did   not   look   fried .   after   seaching   the   internet ,   i   found   that   amazon   had ,   what   i   determined ,   to   be   the   most   reasonable   price .
t3   featherweight   tourmaline   hair   dryer   this   dryer   is   worth   the   money !   i   ve   been   using   cheaper   hair   dryers   for   years   and   finally   opened   the   wallet   and   invested   in   a   professional   quality   one .   i   don   t   notice   that   this   dries   my   hair   any   faster ,   but   it   is   shinier ,   smoother ,   and   seems   to   have   more   body .   for   someone   who   has   hair   that   has   all   the   body   and   styleability   of   dental   floss ,   this   is   a   huge   improvement .   i   like   this   hair   dryer   and   i   got   a   great   price   for   it   on   amazon !
good   hairdryer   this   hairdryer   works   great . i   do   not   see   any   shine   diffrence   in   my   hair   though . transaction   was   smooth   and   fast   service .
compact   with   power   to   dry   hair   purchased   for   domestic   travel .   solid   construction ,   compact ,   and   the   high   heat   speed   has   a   powerful   air   flow   for   such   a   small   head   size .   drys   hair   fast .   has   low   heat   speed   if   you   need   it .   very   satisfied   with   purchase !
not   very   strong   this   dryer   does   not   blow   very   strong   and   takes   a   long   time   for   hair   to   dry .   would   not   recommend   it   even   though   price   is   good .
don   t   buy   it !   the   second   time   i   used   the   hair   dryer ,   it   stopped   mid   drying   and   never   worked   again !   a   total   waste   of   money .
great   hair   dryer ! !   i   am   very   happy   with   this   dryer   it   is   light ,   strong ,   and   the   retractable   cord   works   much   better   than   the   last   one   i   had .   it   is   also   not   overly   bulky .   i   highly   recommend   it ,   especially   for   the   very   reasonable   price .
convinced !   my   conair   hair   dryer   stopped   turning   off   the   other   day   so   i   started   searching   online   for   a   new   one   i   do   this   about   every   1.5 yrs   b   c   they   eventually   die   on   me   .   happened   to   come   across   this   hair   dryer   and   was   intrigued   though   not   sure   what   to   believe .   after   all ,   it   s   just   a   hair   dryer   and   ridiculously   expensive !   it   got   good   and   bad   reviews   so   i   figured   i   d   try   it   out .   i   decided   to   buy   one   at   nordstrom   because   if   i   didn   t   like   it ,   i   could   return   it   and   if   i   did   like   it ,   i   d   have   the   full   warranty .   to   my   surprise   it   did   an   amazing   job   and   i   m   not   very   skilled   at   styling   and   blow   drying   my   hair   at   the   same   time .   i   washed   my   hair   with   the   same   shampoo   and   conditioner   i   ve   been   using   for   a   few   months   and   i   towel   dried   it   a   little   but   my   hair   still   felt   very   wet .   i   did   not   put   any   product   in   my   hair   afterward   like   i   normally   do .   i   used   the   hair   dryer   while   sitting   on   the   floor   in   my   bedroom   and   used   my   brush   as   usual   and   dried   brushed   it   without   a   mirror .   it   definitely   dried   my   hair   faster   than   other   hair   dryers ,   but   i   m   not   sure   how   much   time   it   shaved   off   overall .   when   i   was   all   done ,   my   hair   felt   nice ,   but   nothing   stuck   out   until   i   looked   in   the   mirror !   it   was   nice   and   smooth   no   flyaways   which   i   can   usually   only   get   this   look   when   i   use   shine   smoothing   serum   on   my   hair .   and   when   i   do   that ,   i   m   looking   in   the   mirror   and   constantly   brushing   styling   as   i   m   drying   it .   this   was   actually   pretty   effortless   and   i   m   thrilled   that   i   didn   t   have   to   put   anything   in   my   hair   to   achieve   a   nice ,   smooth ,   professional   look .   very   impressed   after   first   try   and   i   d   recommend   this   hair   dryer   to   anyone .
a   note   about   the   warranty   am   in   the   market   for   a   fabulous   dryer   for   my   natural   african   american   hair .   i   have   heard   rave   reviews   about   the   t3 ,   which   my   stylist   uses .   however ,   the   concerns   regarding   whether   the   manufacturer   will   honor   the   warranty   if   you   buy   from   amazon   turned   me   off .   i   noticed   that   there   were   mixed   postings   however   on   whether   the   manufacturer   will   or   will   not   honor   the   warranty .   so ,   after   hunting   around   on   amazon ,   i   realized   that   there   are   two   manufacturers   selling   the   t3   on   amazon ,   with   a   significant   price   difference   beauty   collection   and   discount   jungle .   beauty   collection   specifically   states   in   its   warranty   description   that   it   will   honor   the   48   month   manufacturer .   i   plan   to   buy   the   dryer ,   but   read   the   product   description   before   you   buy   and   decide   whether   the   difference   in   price   is   worth   buying   with   the   warranty .
turbo   twin   3200   hair   dryer   if   you   are   looking   for   a   dryer   that   will   get   your   hair   real   straight   and   dry   your   hair   fast   this   is   the   dryer   for   you .   the   dryer   is   very   hot   and   you   have   to   be   very   careful   not   to   put   the   heat   on   your   scalp   directly .
so   far   it   s   great   i   bought   this   for   my   wife   when   her   old   one   started   making   a   hideous   shrieking   noise .   she   is   happy   with   it   so   far .   it   doesn   t   get   stupid   hot   so   it   doesn   t   damage   her   hair .   that   is   important   to   her .   she   has   never   mentioned   it   feeling   heavy   so   it   s   not .   trust   me ,   this   94lb   woman   asks   for   help   lifting   a   gallon   of   milk ,   so   really   you   should   be   fine .   i   don   t   know   about   the   ion   aspect ,   i   mean   it   blows   hot ,   dry   air .   even   the   box   it   came   in   didn   t   sound   too   convinced ,   using   phrases   like   ions   may   be   emitted ,   which   could   possibly   make   hair   shinier .   whatever ,   it   does   the   job ,   and   doesn   t   wake   the   dead .
i   love   this .   this   blow   dryer   dries   my   hair   quickly   with   no   frizz .   i   love   it   and   love   the   color .   the   only   thing   that   might   make   it   better   is   if   the   output   was   a   lighter   higher   harder ,   but   it   gets   the   job   done   well .
need   a   little   more   power   and   a   little   longer   cord   attractive   and   easy   install .   husband   thinks   it   does   not   have   enough   power   and   we   are   hoping   the   cord   will   relax   with   use .   great   feature   hanging   on   wall   and   not   fighting   with   cords   in   drawer   or   cabinet ,   so   we   are   going   to   try   and   adapt .
power   packed   dryer !   this   dryer   gets   the   job   done   just   want   it   dry   it   s   fast   and   powerful   and   you   can   easily   direct   it .   it   also   comes   with   two   attachments ,   one   for   straightening ,   the   other   for   zeroing   down   on   problem   areas .   i   love   the   color   too   it   s   bright   and   cheery .
defective   twice   do   not   buy   i   purchased   this   dryer   and   it   was   defective .   the   casing   simply   pulled   apart   at   the   handle   and   the   screws   that   should   have   held   it   together   could   not   be   tightened .   i   ordered   a   replacement   which   came   right   away ,   thank   you ,   amazon   and   it   had   the   same   defect .   the   handle   simply   pulls   apart .   i   don   t   think   that   s   my   bad   luck   i   think   there   is   a   problem   with   the   assembly .
burned   up   in   8   months   i   ve   always   thought   that   oster   produced   great   products   but   not   this   time .   i   purchased   this   hair   dryer   in   november   2007 .   this   morning ,   without   warning ,   it   started   smoking   and   glowing   bright   red   inside .   i   was   able   to   pull   the   plug   the   gfi   never   tripped   .   i   won   t   be   buying   another   one   of   these   hair   dryers .
doesn   t   switch   voltage !   i   bought   this   dryer   to   take   on   a   european   vacation   with   me .   i   was   thrilled   with   the   size   when   it   arrived .   i   used   it   a   few   times   in   the   states   before   i   left   and   it   worked   great   here .   when   i   got   to   europe ,   i   tried   to   change   the   voltage   on   it   and   was   totally   disappointed .   the   voltage   changer   looks   like   you   would   use   a   coin   or   a   screw   driver   to   turn   it .   when   i   turned   the   knob ,   it   fell   out   of   the   appliance   completely   revealing   that   it   wasn   t   attached   to   anything   within   the   appliance ! !   it   was   just   a   hole   with   a   little   black   plug   that   seemed   to   be   put   there   to   make   it   look   like   it   would   change   the   voltage .   of   course ,   as   soon   as   my   traveling   companion   plugged   it   in   the   250   volt   outlet ,   it   began   to   smoke .   what   a   rip   off ! ! !   i   have   hair   that   must   be   styled   and   i   had   to   buy   a   hair   dryer   to   use   while   in   europe .   i   would   never   recommend   this   to   someone   buying   it   for   overseas   travel .   it   simply   doesn   t   change   voltage .
not   bad   dryer ,   especially   when   all   they   make   are   ionics   i   am   super   picky   about   my   hair   dryers .   and   while   this   is   not   the   best   one   i   ve   ever   had   my   favorite   was   an   1875   watt   helen   of   troy   professional   that   died   several   years   ago   ,   it   s   not   bad .   unfortunately ,   in   this   day   and   age ,   the   only   dryers   i   can   seem   to   find   are   ionic   ones .   for   me   ionic   dryers   flat   hair .   so ,   with   the   choices   so   limited ,   this   dryer   is   decent .   i   wish   it   had   slow   fan   speed   with   high   heat ,   but   i   can   t   be   too   choosy   at   this   point .
gotta   love   retractable   cords   this   dryer   has   great   power   and   a   variety   of   settings .   the   retractable   cord   is   a   great   feature   and   keep   the   cords   protected   so   that   it   doesn   t   get   tangled ,   split ,   or   caught   up   with   other   appliance   cords !   i   like   this   hair   dryer ... but   my   old   one   see   link   below   had   a   very   nice   feature   that   you   could   not   only   retract   the   cord ,   but   also   fold   the   handle   up   which   was   perfect   for   storage   and   traveling .   asin   b000bfjj7e   conair   1875   watt   ionic   cord   keeper   hair   dryer  
international   travel   pro   the   hair   dryer   worked   well   in   greece   and   turkey .   the   size   and   power   are   great .   con   the   screw   head   like   button   that   you   turn   to   change   voltage   is   down   right   impossible   for   an   average   female   to   operate .   i   had   trouble   at   home   turning   the   button   with   a   coin   as   recommended   by   the   tech   support   people   when   i   called   for   assistance .   i   finally   had   to   use   a   screw   driver !   now   i   leave   the   setting   set   for   european   voltage   and   just   use   it   for   foreign   travel .
it   s   ok ...   had   this   for   about   two   years   and   the   bearings   have   already   started   to   fail .   makes   more   noise   than   when   new .   it   s   ok ...   but   not   great .

farouk   deep   brilliance   professional   hair   dryer   great   hair   dryer   for   a   great   price .   you   ll   have   to   pay   the   same   for   a   high   end   regular   hair   dryer   at   a   drug   store   or   department   store .   it   gets   fairly   hot ,   and   is   quiet .   it   is   heavier   than   a   normal   dryer .
pros   and   cons   pros   many   attachments ,   price   is   good ,   attractive ,   dries   quickly ,   no   damage .   cons   so   heavy   to   use   and   that   factor   alone   is   enough   to   cancel   out   any   of   the   pros .   the   weight   is   also   unbalanced ,   so   when   you   grip   the   handle   in   the   place   that   best   balances   it   out ,   you   wind   up   hitting   buttons .   the   attachments   fly   off   and   hit   you   in   the   head   midstream   especially   the   diffuser   .   not   recommended .   you   can   do   better .

best   hair   dryer   i   ve   ever   owned   i   ve   been   using   hair   dryers   since   1975 ,   and   this   is   by   far   the   best   i   ve   ever   owned .   it   reminds   me   of   the   way   hair   dryers   used   to   be   designed   moderate   heat   but   high   air   flow .   that   s   the   correct   way   to   do   it .   the   cheap   mass   market   hair   dryers   started   getting   this   backwards   around   the   time   they   all   transitioned   from   squirrel   cage   fans   to   radial   fans .   heating   element   wire   is   cheaper   than   decent   fans   motors ,   i   guess   and   if   that   turns   a   hair   dryer   into   a   blowtorch ,   so   what   people   who   don   t   know   any   better   will   buy   them   anyway .   this   particular   unit   has   a   very   long   round   cord .   i   can   t   vouch   for   the   cord   s   durability ,   but   i   see   no   reason   it   wouldn   t   hold   up .   even   if   it   were   fragile ,   though ,   i   d   still   want   to   own   this   hair   dryer .   cords   are   easy   to   replace .   i   ve   put   two   on   my   massive   ge   steam   iron ,   an   old   timer   from   the   1960s .   in   summary ,   then ,   this   dryer   is   tough ,   heavy ,   quiet ,   comfortable ,   extraordinarily   effective ,   and   obviously   built   for   the   long   haul .   it   is   far ,   far   above   anything   i   ve   seen   in   the   stores   since   squirrel   cage   motors   disappeared   some   years   ago .
not   to   happy   i   am   surprised   to   see   that   it   is   hard   to   put   away   in   case   and   i   would   like   a   way   to   talk   to   someone   on   the   shipping   for   19.99   and   it   took   almost   5   days   to   get ,   i   won   t   be   ordering   again .   if   i   was   to   get   a   call   and   get   a   refund ,   i   am   concerned   about   the   bad   reviews   that   i   have   seen   for   this   product .
very   good   hair   dryer   i   used   the   same   brand   hair   dryer   for   2   decades   before   buying   this   dryer .   i   was   very   satisfied   with   it   from   the   moment   i   turned   it   on .   it   dries   my   hair   fast   and   well .   nobody   knows   i   really   have   curly   hair .   i   was   apprehensive   to   try   a   new   dryer   but   this   was   a   good   choice .   i   highly   recommend   it .
bonnet   will   not   last   i   thought   it   worked   great   the   few   times   i   used   it   but   i   should   have   heeded   what   others   wrote   here .   the   bonnet   is   very   cheap   and   became   unusable   after   only   a   few   times   of   use .
not   bad   at   all   i   was   not   too   sure   about   this   with   all   the   other   reviews ,   but   i   bought   it   anyway .   well   i   m   so   glad   i   did ,   this   works   great   for   me .   i   have   medium   hair   about   shoulder   length .   i   put   it   on   medium   and   it   dried   my   hair   with   curlers .   it   never   shut   off ,   in   fact   it   was   a   bit   warm .   i   don   t   know   if   the   other   people   got   defective   ones ,   but   mine   works   just   fine .   good   luck   to   anyone   else   who   buys   it .
decent   for   the   price   i   got   this   item   on   sale .   i   like   that   it   is   small   and   my   diffuser   fits   on   to   the   end   the   nozzle   on   my   old   dryer   was   too   wide   ,   but   the   coolest   setting   is   still   quite   warm ,   and   it   starts   to   smell   like   it   s   overheating   after   about   10   minutes   of   use .   i   have   short   hair ,   so   i   only   use   it   for   about   10   minutes ,   but   overall ,   it   gets   the   job   done .
dont   do   it !   i   will   say   that   this   blowdryer   does   dry   my   hair   faster   than   a   regular   one ,   but   for   150   bucks   my   hair   still   comes   out   frizzy .   i   tried   to   send   the   warranty   and   yes   since   amazon   is   not   an   authorized   buyer   bespoke   labs   will   not   honor   the   warranty .   it   was   too   late   for   me   to   return .   i   d   rather   have   bought   the   smaller   version   full   price   at   sephora   or   somewhere   else ,   but   i   feel   this   was   a   big   waste   of   my   money .
didn   t   last   just   purchased   this   a   few   months   ago   but   didn   t   start   using   it   until   a   few   weeks   ago .   it   s   only   blowing   cool   air   now ,   hard   to   believe   it   s   a   salon   dryer .   while   it   worked ,   it   worked   well   but   i   can   t   return   it   now   and   it   wasn   t   worth   what   i   paid   for   it .
decent   hairdryer   but   it   is   not   as   compact   as   it   seems .   br   i   wanted   to   replace   my   huge   hairdryer   with   something   br   smaller   and   this   ended   up   being   the   same   size   as   the   one   i   had .   br   also ,   it   s   ionic   and   supposed   to   not   leave   your   hair   frizzy   but   br   i   did   not   notice   any   difference .
couldn   t   ask   for   more !   i   spent   several   weeks   researching   hair   dryers   before   making   this   purchase .   this   dryer   was   recommended   to   me   by   my   hair   stylist .   i   have   very   thick   hair   with   a   slight   wave   just   enough   to   be   annoying   not   completely   straight   or   curly   and   was   looking   for   a   dryer   that   would   cut   down   on   frizz   and   dry   time   and   just   plain   make   it   easier   to   dry   my   hair   this   has   done   it   all .   it   is   also   very   lightweight   and   much   quieter   than   my   previous   conair   dryer .   now   to   be   honest ,   this   is   the   first   expensive   dryer   i   have   ever   purchased   so   i   can   t   personally   compare   it   to   others   out   there   on   the   market ,   but   i   read   every   review   i   could   get   my   hands   on   before   buying   and   i   didn   t   see   any   negatives   where   other   expensive   dryers   t3   for   instance   seemed   to   have   just   as   many   unhappy   customers   as   happy   ones .   even   though   it   was   quite   expensive   i   don   t   regret   it   one   bit .   and ,   even   though   fhi   won   t   honor   their   warranty   if   you   buy   it   from   amazon ,   amazon   will   honor   the   manufacturer   s   warranty .   it   was   much   cheaper   here .
very   good   hairdryer   great   hairdryer .   we   used   one   in   a   marriott   property   and   my   wife   liked   it   so   much   i   found   it   on   line   and   we   ordered   it   that   day .   quieter   than   many   other   models   we   have   had   and   feels   sturdier .   does   not   fold   up ,   so   if   you   want   to   travel ,   you   might   want   something   else .   but   for   home   use ,   it   does   great .
brilliant !   i   ve   owned   many   hairdryers   over   the   years ... they   seem   to   last   a   year   or   so   then   die   a   quick   and   sometimes   painful   death .   none   has   been   anything   to   get   excited   about .   i   decided   to   take   a   chance   on   the   farouk   deep   brilliance ,   based   on   the   great   reviews ,   great   price ,   and   the   farouk   name .   some   may   be   put   off   by   the   bright   orange   color ,   but   mine   gets   stowed   in   a   cabinet ,   so   it   s   not   a   decorative   accessory .   the   quality   is   outstanding   and   hopefully   will   be   around   more   that   a   year   or   two .   even   more   impressive   is   the   way   it   styles   may   hair .   i   have   short   hair   and   the   high   setting   dries   my   hair   in   no   time .   i   love   the   lower   setting   for   styling   with   my   round   brush .   it   still   provides   plenty   of   heat   to   set   the   curve ,   but   the   air   velocity   doesn   t   blow   my   hair   off   the   brush .   my   hair   looks   much   shinier   but   with   lots   of   volume .   fantastic !
bespoke   t3   i   love   this   hair   dryer   so   much .   i   used   it   at   a   friends   house   several   times   and   finally   just   bought   my   own .   sephora   sells   it   for   216   after   tax   and   amazon   145 .   money   well   spent !   my   hair   is   long   and   thick   and   it   usually   takes   about   12   15   minutes   to   dry   and   that   s   after   i   ve   towel   dried   it ,   applied   makeup ,   fixed   the   bed ,   etc ...   my   t3   takes   4   minutes ,   i   ve   actually   timed   it .   i   know   its ,   just   a   hairdryer   as   my   husband   would   say   but   if   you   are   anything   like   me   in   the   morning   every   second   counts .   i   love   it   and   amazon   always   comes   through   with   the   best   prices ! !   can   t   wait   to   buy   the   straightening   iron !
quiet ,   fast   drying ,   easy   to   clean ,   great   for   thick   hair   i   ve   had   my   bespoke   labs   83808   se   for   a   few   months   now   and   really   love   it .   i   have   thick ,   wavy   hair   and   am   really   hard   on   my   blow   dryers   and   i   ve   had   many   over   the   years .   this   one   is ,   hands   down ,   the   quietest ,   fastest   drying   dryer   i   ve   ever   had ,   and   it   makes   my   hair   shiny   and   smooth ,   not   frizzy .   the   lint   filter   is   easy   to   access   and   clean .   in   brief ,   there   s   just   nothing   not   to   like   about   it .   it   s   pricey   but ,   given   that   i   ve   gone   through   one   or   two   lower   priced   blow   dryers   every   year   for   the   past   heaven   knows   how   many   years   and   that   it   seems   like   this   one   s   going   to   last   a   long   time ,   i   think   it   s   actually   the   most   economical   choice .
andis   on   the   run   this   is   an   excellent   hair   dryer   that   out   performs   the   cheezy   and   inexpensive   brands   out   there .   do   not   get   cross   minded   when   choosing   this   hair   dryer   because   it   get   the   job   done   right .   some   people   complain   about   how   heavy   this   thing   is   and   i   can   only   tell   you   that   any   professional   hair   dryer   is   going   to   pretty   close   to   this   weight .   overall ,   this   hair   dryer   is   the   best   you   can   get   for   the   money   and   it   will   perform   as   described .
my   hair   is   falling   out   from   this   dryer !   i   decided   to   try   an   inexpensive   hair   dryer   for   the   first   time   since   money   was   tight ,   and   now   i   really   regret   it .   i   have   very   thick   long   hair   and   it   took   the   hair   dryer   much   longer   to   dry   my   hair   than   my   old   one .   after   a   couple   uses   i   noticed   the   smell   of   burning   hair   and   thought   maybe   it   was   a   little   too   hot   but   my   hair   seemed   fine   so   i   didn   t   really   worry   about   it .   then   i   began   to   notice   after   i   showered   and   started   to   comb   my   wet   hair   a   lot   more   hair   than   normal   was   falling   out .   it   was   falling   out   in   thick   strands   which   has   never   happened   to   me   before .   i   thought   maybe   it   was   stress   or   horomones   since   i   recently   had   a   baby   but   the   more   i   used   the   dryer   i   realized   the   intense   heat   was   burning   off   and   damaging   my   hair !   even   now   that   i   ve   stopped   using   it   my   hair   is   still   fragile   from   the   dryer   and   still   comes   out   in   clumps   after   i   shower .   please   stay   away   from   this   dryer !   i   m   glad   mine   never   shot   sparks   like   the   other   reviews   i   saw   but   it   doesn   t   surprise   me .
great   i   love   this   product .   my   hairdresser   told   me   to   buy   it   and   i   couldn   t   be   happier .
don   t   waste   your   money   first   hairdryer   arrived   damaged ,   second   hairdryer   only   lasted   five   months   before   overheating .   now   what ,   i   have   no   box   to   return   the   item   but   i   am   going   to   let   the   company   know   my   dissatisfaction   with   their   product   and   see   what   happens .   i   m   going   back   to   conair !
e   owens   alabama   better   that   i   expected   always   used   a   comb   dryer , i   am   a   changed   person   no   more   combs   for   me
good   hair   dryer   i   purchased   this   hair   dryer   for   my   wife   and   she   likes   it   very   much .   she   said   it   worke   s   as   good   as   a   more   expensive   one   she   had   used .   the   on   off   buttons   on   the   handle   are   a   small   problem ,   they   can   be   hit   by   accident .
ver   pleased   very   pleased   with   this   product .   drying   time   is   cut   in   half   compared   to   other   blow   dryers !
good   blow   but   doesn   t   last   cord   breaks   consistently   the   elchim   1800   r   b   hairdryer   performs   great .   i   should   know   because   i   ve   had   4   of   them .   i   keep   buying   them   on   average   1   18mos .   this   is   not   good .   the   systemic   problem   with   them   is   that   the   cord   breaks   a   wire   internally   right   near   the   top   just   below   the   rubber   protector .   i   m   thinking   the   rubber   protector   may   just   be   the   problem .   this   has   happened   to   me   on   all   4   elchims   i   have   purchased .   my   hair   stylist   confirms   what   i   have   found .   he   said   that   he   constantly   has   to   repair   the   cords   on   elchims .   the   cord   is   not   round   as   stated   in   some   other   reviews .   it   is   the   flat   type .   wish   the   manufacturer   would   fix   this   regretable   situation .
t3   bespoke   hair   dryer   this   is   the   last   time   i   order   anything   but   books   thru   amazon .   i   have   a   major   probelm   every   time .   i   ordered   the   featherweight   dryer   with   a   diffuser .   instead   i   got   the   special   edition   with   no   diffuser   for   more   money !   there   was   no   contact   information   on   the   order   no   phone   number   i   called   amazon   and   got   no   help   at   all .   i   had   to   spend   more   money   to   order   the   diffuser .   so   i   ended   up   spending   more   money   and   did   not   get   the   product   i   ordered   through   the   amazon   site .
definitely   good   but   little   bulky   definitely   a   good   product   and   i   believe   in   conair   quality   and   realiability .   but   this   hair   dryer   is   little   bulkier ,   otherwise   it   works   great .
one   of   the   best   i   ve   owned .   we   got   this   for   a   trip   and   it   was   great   because   it   had   a   folding   handle   and   retractable   cord .   made   packing   super   easy .   it   got   real   hot   and   i   recommend   it   for   anybody   that   needs   a   great   dryer .
hair   dryer   it   looks   great   on   the   wall ,   but   just   isn   t   very   powerful .   takes   much   longer   to   dry   my   hair ,   wish   i   had   known .
as   advertised   i   like   the   designer   look   of   this   hair   dryer .   it   is   fairly   quiet   as   advertised   and   the   wall   mount   certainly   adds   to   the   convenience .
two   quit   working   in   less   than   two   months   i   bought   the   first   one   and   hung   it   on   the   wall   in   my   guest   bathroom .   within   two   months ,   it   went   dead .   bought   a   second   identical   one   and   it   went   dead   in   the   same   period   of   time   with   no   one   using   it .   too   bad   because   i   really   liked   the   light   and   it   worked   great   when   it   worked .
electric   hair   dryer   delivered   promtly   after   my   order .   works   as   advertised   but   a   bit   noisy .   overall   rating ,   good
best   hair   dryer   i   ve   ever   owned   i   ve   owned   this   dryer   for   only   a   few   weeks ,   so   i   cannot   speak   to   its   longevity .   this   is   my   third   hair   dryer   with   a   cord   reel ,   which   i   find   convenient .   the   first   one   was   ok   and   worked   well ,   but   was   noisy .   my   second   one   asin   b000bfjj7e   conair   1875   watt   ionic   cord   keeper   hair   dryer   ,   which   i   used   for   only   a   couple   months ,   was   also   noisy .   the   cord   in   it   was   also   too   short   4   feet   and   when   retracting   it ,   rewound   so   quickly   that   the   plug   would   whip   around   and   hit   me   painfully   in   the   hand .   i   had   to   be   careful   about   how   to   hold   it   when   retracting   the   cord .   it   also   had   only   fast   hot   and   slow   warm   settings .   i   got   fed   up   with   it ,   so   i   looked   for   new   options   at   a   local   target .   i   found   this   dryer   and   was   hesitant   to   pay   twice   as   much   for   it   as   i   did   the   previous   ones .   i   couldn   t   imagine   what   could   be   special   enough   about   it   to   justify   two   and   a   half   times   the   cost .   when   i   tried   it ,   i   was   quite   surprised .   the   first   thing   i   noticed   is   that   it   is   heavier   and   feels   very   solid   and   well   built .   i   don   t   care   about   the   weight   it   takes   me   only   a   minute   or   two   to   dry   my   medium   length   for   a   man   hair .   the   next   surprise   was   that   it   is   extremely   quiet   even   at   high   speed .   i   no   longer   have   to   turn   up   my   radio   to   hear   the   news   while   drying   my   hair .   it   has   independent   controls   for   heat   and   speed .   i   usually   like   to   use   high   heat   with   the   low   speed   so   it   doesn   t   blow   my   hair   so   much .   the   5   foot   cord   retracts   slowly   and   safely   and   is   just   the   perfect   length   for   my   situation .   i   would   not   describe   the   quietness   of   the   dryer   as   slightly   better   than   the   cheaper   driers   i   have   used   before   it   is   a   dramatic   difference .   i   have   often   wondered   about   the   potential   hearing   loss   my   old   dryers   might   cause ,   but   didn   t   worry   too   much   because   it   didn   t   take   very   long   to   dry   my   hair .   if   i   still   had   long   hair ,   i   would   be   seriously   concerned   about   the   noise   from   a   cheap   dryer .   as   for   how   well   my   hair   looks   after   using   it ,   i   notice   no   difference   from   the   other   dryers .   my   hair   if   very   fineand   thick   with   some   wave ,   so   it   is   pretty   easy   to   care   for .   it   will   frizz   in   high   humidity ,   but   i   live   in   denver   and   humidity   is   not   a   problem   here .   i   have   not   tried   this   in   a   humid   environment .   i   highly   recommend   this   dryer .   update   on   2010   10   17   this   dryer   is   still   working   great   and   i   still   consider   it   the   best   dryer   i   ve   ever   used .   update   on   2011   12   29   i   cut   my   hair   shorter   last   april   and   no   longer   use   the   hair   dryer .   it   was   still   working   perfectly   after   three   years .
hairy   scary !   on   the   5th   day   of   use   ever ,   this   drier   burned   off   a   whole   section   of   my   hair !   i   smelled   burning   and   turned   off   the   drier ,   ran   my   hand   over   my   hair   and   the   whole   section   fell   to   the   floor !   the   hairs   were   scorched   and   melted   together .   my   hairdresser   always   comments   on   the   great   health   of   my   long   hair ,   i   ve   never   processed   it ,   i   never   even   get   split   ends ,   so   that   s   not   even   an   issue   here .   i   bought   this   drier   because   my   last   revlon   drier   was   great .   never   again !   i   ve   complained   to   revlon ,   still   waiting   to   hear   from   them .
worst   hair   dryer   i   have   ever   owned .   i   got   so   fed   up   with   this   dryer ,   i   gave   up   on   it   after   just   a   couple   of   months .   i   now   very   happily   own   a   asin   b000r80ztq   infiniti   by   conair   223   cord   reel   folding   handle   dryer   ,   which ,   despite   amazon   s   title ,   does   not   have   a   folding   handle .   this   was   my   second   hair   dryer   with   a   cord   reel ,   which   i   find   convenient ,   but   there   are   several   things   i   really   hate   about   it .   it   is   very   noisy   and   i   have   to   turn   the   radio   up   loud   to   hear   the   news   even   when   using   the   slow   speed .   you   should   be   concerned   about   hearing   loss   if   you   use   this .   the   cord   is   way   too   short   4   feet   and   when   retracting   it ,   rewinds   so   quickly   that   the   plug   whips   around   and   hits   me   painfully   in   the   hand .   i   have   to   be   careful   about   how   to   hold   it   when   retracting   the   cord .   it   also   had   only   fast   hot   and   slow   warm   settings .   i   prefer   to   use   high   heat   and   a   slow   speed ,   but   that   is   not   available   on   this   cheap   piece   of   junk .   i   highly   recommend   you   do   not   waste   your   money   on   this   hair   dryer .
check   the   distance   to   your   outlet   product   works   fine   and   installs   easily   but   you   should   make   sure   that   you   have   an   outlet   and   a   place   to   mount   the   dryer   that   allows   the   cord   to   reach   the   outlet   and   the   dryer   to   reach   your   head .   with   the   cord   from   the   dryer   only   about   six   feet   when   fully   extended ,   finding   that   perfect   spot   is   not   necessarily   as   simple   as   you   might   think .
best   little   hair   dryer   i   have   tried   i   purchased   this   for   my   trip   to   florida   where   i   would   be   staying   with   friends   who   didn   t   have   a   hair   dryer ...   this   is   a   wonderful   little   dryer .   i   have   recently   been   a   backpack   traveler   and   this   folds   down   and   fits   in   any   bag   you   would   want   to   travel   with .
conair   sb1   soft   bonnet   hair   dryer   i   m   frustating   too .   i   bougth   this   one   the   last   year ,   and   yet   i   can   t   dry   my   hair   one   time .   its   terrible .   bad ,   bad .   dont   have   power .
good   product   hair   dryer   works   great .   br   mounting   plate   was   a   little   bit   tricky   to   install   though   could   have   a   better   design .   br   all   in   all ,   a   satisfactory   purchase .
rocks   your   socks !   so   powerful   and   efficient   at   its   job .   smaller   than   i   thought   it   would   be   but   not   too   small   at   all !
great   product   and   price   i   read   all   the   reviews   and   decided   to   give   this   hair   dryer   a   chance   since   it   was   such   a   great   price .   i   have   to   say   that   it   s   lighter   then   the   one   i   had   before   and   it   s   super   quiet   and   i   don   t   feel   like   i   have   to   use   ear   plugs   just   to   dry   my   hair .   it   dries   my   hair   quickly .   i   thought   about   getting   an   ionic   dryer   but   my   hair   dresser   said   that   it   really   wouldn   t   make   a   difference .   i   m   very   happy   with   this   dryer   and   i   m   going   to   buy   one   for   my   mom .
hair   dryer   the   retractable   cord   has   already   stopped   working ... probably   haven   t   used   the   dryer   10   times .   it   won   t   stay   out !
too   hot   to   handle   in   a   bad   way   asin   b000k7jlgm   t3   bespoke   labs   83808   se   featherweight   professional   ionic   ceramic   tourmaline   hair   dryer   this   dryer   is   dangerous ,   and   doesn   t   work   well   at   all .   yes ,   it   dries   hair .   there   is   no   standard   temperature   setting ,   you   can   just   have   high   strength   or   low   wind   level ,   not   heat   and   it   is   so   hot   i   ve   burned   myself   and   my   hair   on   it .   because   it   gets   so   hot ,   it   s   own   internal   temperature   regulator   shuts   it   off   all   the   time   in   the   middle   of   drying .   the   only   way   to   turn   it   back   on   is   to   wait   until   it   decides   it   s   ready   to   go   again   several   minutes   of   sitting .   it   is   quieter ,   but   who   cares ,   if   it   s   quietly   burning   your   skin   and   hair   i   am   actively   pursuing   a   refund ,   don   t   waste   your   money .
the   convenience   is   nice ,   but   it   failed   after   a   year .   installation   is   fairly   easy .   the   convenience   of   having   the   dryer   on   the   wall ,   along   with   the   cord   management ,   was   as   hoped   for .   however ,   it   failed   after   a   year ,   with   smoke   and   burning   plastic   odor .   the   failure   occurred   in   the   wall   mount   area .   given   the   nature   of   the   failure ,   i   can   t   recommend   this   dryer .   br   br   if   you   need   the   convenience ,   i   d   recommend   just   buying   a   regular   hair   dryer   along   with   a   nice   universal   wall   mount .   i   ve   noticed   that   many   hotels   no   longer   have   wall   mounted   hair   dryers ,   probably   to   help   save   on   similar   maintenance   issues .

andis   hairdryer   i   like   this   hairdryer .   this   one   replaced   our   old   one .   our   experience   is   that   they   only   last   about   two   or   three   years   before   needing   to   be   replaced .   this   is   the   third   one   we   ve   purchased .
won   t   stay   in   locked   position   after   6   months   like   many   out   there ,   my   last   conair   dryer   lasted   nearly   20   years .   this   new   conair   was   very   good   for   the   first   6   months   but   now   it   only   wants   to   remain   in   the   convenient   fold   down   storage   position .   it   s   like   someone   broke   it   s   little   red   neck .

andis   professional   dryer   the   first   one   i   purchased   had   to   be   returned   the   same   week .   we   noticed   that   although   it   was   turned   off   but   plugged   in   it   was   extremely   hot   to   the   touch .   we   had   no   problems   whatsoever   returning   the   product   to   amazon .   i   have   received   a   replacement   in   the   mail   however ,   i   am   a   little   afraid   to   use   it   and   will   be   very   certain   to   unplug   it   after   usage .
updated ... again !   read   fully   compliments   keep   coming   lots   of   homework   done   for   you   let   me   address   the   title   of   the   review .   from   the   very   first   day   she   used   this   thing ,   she   started   getting   compliments   about   her   hair .   her   hair   is   normally   pretty   straight   and   flat ,   and   it   definitely   had   more   body .   it   was   also   less   frizzy   after   she   got   done   drying   it   for   whatever   that   s   worth .   the   compliments   are   fading   now   that   her   coworkers   are   used   to   the   new   look ,   but   my   wife   is   still   raving   about   it .   br   br   i   purchased   this   for   her   because   i   got   tired   of   repairing   or   replacing   all   of   the   crappy   ones   she   bought   over   the   years .   the   latest   one   i   put   to   rest   dimmed   all   of   the   lights   in   the   house   when   it   was   coming   online .   she   and   i   needed   a   change .   i   read   all   of   the   good   reviews   on   amazon ,   and   elsewhere ,   and   gave   it   a   shot .   br   br   the   elchim   is   everything   i   hoped   for   in   a   hairdryer .   the   first   thing   my   wife   and   i   both   noticed   was   that   it   was   much   quieter   than   any   hair   dryer   she   had   ever   used .   its   highest   setting   is   equivalent   to   most   hair   dryers   lowest   setting .   we   can   actually   hold   a   conversation   now   if   we   need   to   while   she   dries   her   hair .   i   figured   it   was   up   to   my   wife   to   protect   her   own   hearing ,   but   i   was   very   concerned   when   she   dried   my   daughter   s   hair .   it   definitely   defeats   the   myth   that   louder   is   better   or   more   powerful .   br   br   secondly ,   the   quieter   airflow   was   very   powerful .   1500   liters   minute   is   the   claim .   i   haven   t   ever   seen   another   volume   measurement ,   but   it   sounds   impressive ,   right   anyway ,   as   others   have   stated ,   my   wife   dried   her   hair   in   about   half   of   the   time   that   it   took   her   normally .   she   thought   i   was   nuts   when   i   showed   it   to   her   and   it   did   not   sound   like   a   fighter   jet ,   but   she   was   pleasantly   surprised .   it   has   a   removable   filter   screen   twist   off   on   the   end   to   keep   the   airflow   at   its   peak   which   will   prove   invaluable   over   time .   the   buildup   of   hairspray ,   makeup ,   lint ,   and   whatever   else   will   be   easy   to   remove   without   completely   disassembling   it .   this   congealed   mess   has   contributed   to   the   deaths   of   other   hair   dryers   in   the   past .   br   br   elchim   is   a   professional   brand   and   they   build   their   products   for   heavy   duty   use .   it   has   a   thick   round   cord ,   which   will   be   much   less   prone   to   tangling .   it   is   smaller   than   almost   every   full   size   hair   dryer   she   has   owned .   it   has   a   sleek   design   as   opposed   to   the   ones   with   the   cylinder   sticking   out   the   side   to   house   the   motor .   this   will   prove   great   for   packing .   i   expect   it   to   last   for   years .   br   br   i   read   many   mixed   reviews   about   the   ionic   dryers ,   tourmaline ,   ceramic   heating   elements ,   emf ,   etc . ,   but   none   swayed   me   away   from   common   sense .   see   below   br   br   the   ionic   dryers   are   supposed   to   trap   moisture   in   your   hair .   a   few   things   on   that   moisture   weight .   weight   flat .   conditioners   are   still   the   best   thing   to   protect   your   hair   and   give   it   shine   without   weighing   it   down .   many   use   wax ,   which   is   much   lighter   than   water   and   gives   body   and   shine   without   weighing   the   hair   down .   br   br   there   are   also   claims   about   breaking   down   the   water   molecules   to   smaller   sizes .   science   note   breaking   down   a   molecule   of   water   h2o   leaves   hydrogen   peroxide   ho   and   a   free   hydrogen   atom   h   .   we   now   have   that   answer   for   fuel   cell   cars   and   bleach   blondes ,   right   ionic   dryers   don   t   heat   the   air ,   they   heat   the   hair   from   within .   isn   t   that   what   microwaves   do   there   are   good   ionic   dryers   out   there ,   but   be   wary   of   the   claims .   some   people   claim   that   ionic   dryers   also   cause   dry   eyes   and   headaches .   i   did   not   see   a   need   to   risk   anything   like   that .   br   br   last   thing   about   ionic   dryers ,   the   cheaper   ones   use   technology   in   which   the   ionizer   does   not   last .   a   good   ionic   dryer   will   cost   you   more   than   the   29.95   delivered !   versions .   read   the   reviews ,   none   of   the   5   star   reviews   for   the   cheaper   ones   is   after   extended   use .   many   of   the   lowest   reviews   complain   about   inconsistency ,   lack   of   performance ,   and   breaking   down   altogether .   if   you   want   a   good   ionic   dryer ,   be   prepared   to   spend   a   little .   if   the   cheapies   were   the   answer ,   they   would   be   in   use   in   the   salons .   br   br   bottom   line   your   hearing   matters   protect   it .   proven   technology   matters   ignore   the   hype   about   trapping   moisture   in   the   hair   you   are   trying   to   dry .   ergonomics   matter   pack   ability ,   weight ,   and   hand   comfort   might   make   or   break   you   on   how   you   feel   about   your   hair   dryer .   my   wife   s   arrived   in   all   black ... so   what .   she   never   paraded   one   around   in   the   past ,   and   i   don   t   expect   her   to   anytime   soon .   they   only   make   black ,   white ,   red ,   and   red   black ,   no   neon   or   orange   surprises .   there   is   no   substitute   for   quality   and   durability .   while   you   may   not   always   get   what   you   pay   for ,   if   you   buy   cheap   things ,   the   adage   holds   true .   br   br   i   researched   these   things   thoroughly   before   i   bought   it   and   read   several   reviews   where   people   were   using   their   elchim   hair   dryers   for   10   years .   i   have   no   doubt   that   this   will   follow   those   lines .   salons   around   the   world   use   them   several   hours   per   day .   ours   should   last   for   years .   well   worth   the   60   ish   i   paid .   br   br   update   feb   20 ,   2010   br   br   after   about   two   years   and   no   abuse ,   the   cord   on   my   wife   s   hairdryer   crapped   the   bed .   what   is   weird   is   that   it   broke   about   three   inches   down   from   the   rubber   protector   that   goes   into   the   handle .   i   expected   any   break   would   be   at   a   bend   where   the   protector   ends   or   inside   of   the   hairdryer   where   it   is   internally   clamped .   it   broke   where   it   should   have   never   been   an   issue .   i   cut   the   cord   about   two   inches   from   the   solder   points ,   where   i   thought   the   break   would   be ,   intending   to   solder   back   on .   as   it   turned   out ,   the   intermittent   wiring   was   about   three   to   four   inches   further   down   from   my   original   cut .   when   i   dissected   the   failed   portion ,   it   looked   like   it   had   been   accidentally   crimped   or   kinked   in   the   manufacturing   process .   i   still   hold   that   the   hairdryer   is   top   notch .   i   will   repair   the   cord   on   the   next   one   i   get ,   if   i   get   the   same   model .   why   do   i   need   another   one   read   on .   br   br   for   the   guys   out   there   saying   no   biggy ,   i   can   fix   a   cord ,   beware .   for   the   record ,   this   thing   is   a   beast   to   disassemble   and   reassemble .   iwork   with   all   sorts   of   electronics .   when   it   originally   failed ,   i   opened   up   the   hairdryer   thinking   the   electrical   problem   was   internal .   once   i   was   inside ,   i   saw   the   problem   was   not   there .   however ,   there   were   two   wires   in   there   that   broke   with   little   maneuvering   and   prove   near   impossible   to   repair .   after   reassembling   the   hairdryer ,   i   could   not   get   the   screws   seated   well   enough   to   feel   safe   when   in   the   hands   of   my   wife   or   daughter .   i   threw   it   out   after   much   frustration   and   solder .   it   did   work   when   i   got   it   back   together ,   but   the   exposed   screws   in   a   wet   environment   caused   me   concern .   br   br   i   regret   doing   this   because   i   was   the   person   that   posted   the   pictures   of   the   cord   and   how   it   would   never   break .   alas ,   i   was   wrong .   i   think   i   will   look   for   a   newer   different   model   by   the   same   manufacturer .   i   did   not   contact   elchim   to   see   how   much   a   repair   was .   after   shipping   both   ways ,   i   m   sure   it   would   have   been   up   there   with   the   cost   of   the   dryer   itself .   i   did   email   them   a   detailed   description   of   the   failure   though .   nobody   has   replied   to   that   letter .   my   wife   hates   the   replacement   dryer   tourmaline   and   wants   her   elchim   back .   br   br   for   all   those   that   i   doubted   i   m   stupid .   you   re   smart .   i   was   wrong .   you   were   right .   you   re   the   best .   i   m   the   worst .   you   re   very   good   looking .   i   m   not   attractive .   from   happy   gilmore   i   thought   about   posting   pictures   of   my   failure ,   but   what   s   the   point .   i   edited   a   picture   previously   posted   noting   where   the   item   eventually   broke .   good   electrician ,   possibly   a   good   deal .   i   would   change   my   star   rating ,   but   it   would   remove   my   review   from   the   most   helpful   spot .   if   you   read   this   far ,   you   must   have   felt   it   was   helpful   too .... or   at   least   amusing   br   br   update   december   2013   br   br   when   the   last   one   died   my   fault   three   years   back ,   i   didn   t   replace   it   because   she   had   purchased   a   cheap   stand   in   while   i   wrongfully   attempted   to   fix   the   cord .   she   simply   kept   using   it   after   i   killed   the   elchim .   i   put   up   with   screaming   our   morning   conversations   for   longer   than   i   should   have   waiting   for   the   cheap   jet   engine   to   die .   well ,   it   lives   on ,   but   my   patience   broke .   i   reluctantly   coughed   up   the   money   for   a   new   elchim .   same   model ,   just   different   color .   omg ,   it   s   so   much   nicer   to   not   have   to   listen   to   that   screaming   menace   in   the   morning .   we   can   actually   talk   to   each   other   if   necessary   while   she   dries   her   hair .   she   ll   probably   appreciate   life   more   once   she   can   heard   birds   singing   again .   i   felt   a   bit   stupid   after   i   killed   the   first   one ,   and   i   didn   t   want   to   augment   that   feeling   by   spending   for   a   hair   dryer   when   she   already   had   a   replacement .   now   that   i   swallowed   my   pride   and   replaced   the   elchim ,   everyone   s   happier ... and   i   m   sure   we   hear   a   little   better   too .
elchim   professional   hair   dryer   this   was   an   excellent   buy   and   a   great   product .   i   saved   around   20.00   as   compared   to   discount   stores   in   my   area .   the   shipping   was   supposed   to   be   5   7   business   days   and   i   received   it   in   2   days !   i   am   always   very   satisfied   with   amazon . com   purchases .
so   far ,   so   good   this   dryer   is   perfectly   adequate .   i   m   not   as   exhuberant   as   some   other   reviewers ,   but   i   can   t   really   find   anything   wrong   with   it .   size   and   weight   are   fine .   noise   level   is   fine .   i   find   the   controls   in   a   perfectly   normal   spot   and   i   don   t   have   trouble   with   them .   i   don   t   think   my   hair   dries   any   quicker   than   with   my   old   dryer ,   but   i   do   have   less   static   flyaways .   my   hair   seems   smooth   and   bouncy   and   healthy .   not   sure   how   much   is   due   to   the   dryer .   the   one   strange   thing   is   i   couldn   t   find   anywhere   that   said   how   many   watts   it   has ,   and   now   i   own   it   and   still ,   none   of   the   packing   materials ,   box ,   insert   or   even   the   dryer   itself   says   how   many   watts ,   which   is   odd .   but   it   has   enough   power   for   me   my   old   dryer   had   1875   .   for   40 ,   its   fine .   had   i   paid   the   259   supposed   sticker   price ,   i   d   be   disappointed .   i   ve   never   used   the   more   expensive   models   though   so   i   don   t   know   if   they   are   any   different .

all   the   comforts   of   on   the   road !   i   do   my   share   of   traveling   with   work   and   personal .   i   noticed   that   i   always   used   the   hair   dryer   that   was   hanging   up   in   the   hotel   bathroom .   i   rarely   used   it   at   home .   i   realized   the   convenience   of   ready   to   go   made   the   difference .   no   more   cords   to   untangle   before   plugging   in .   i   am   extremely   satisfied   with   my   new   andis   30975 .   plus   now   there   isn   t   an   ion   to   be   found   on   my   head .
what   is   all   the   fuss   about   this   dryer   sucks !   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   based   on   all   the   glowing   reviews   i   read   about   it .   so   of   course   when   it   arrived ,   i   was   excited   to   see   just   how   fabulous   a   job   it   was   going   to   do   drying   my   hair .   okay   for   starters ,   this   thing   has   2   settings   slow   and   hot ,   fast   and   heat   of   a   thousand   suns   hot .   the   setting   that   this   dryer   has   for   low   on   the   heat   side   would   be   about   as   hot   i   would   normally   dry   my   hair ... but   since   there   s   no   speed   setting   to   choose   from ,   i   d   be   in   the   bathroom   for   about   an   hour   trying   to   get   my   hair   dry .   the   thing   is   a   little   clumsy   to   hold   and   the   nozzle   is   just   slightly   bigger   than   a   silver   dollar   so   there   s   not   even   a   lot   of   air   coming   out   of   it .   i   turned   it   on ,   used   it   for   about   2   minutes ,   repacked   it   into   the   box   and   came   out   here   to   immediately   begin   the   return   process .   save   your   money .   this   thing   isn   t   the   savior   of   hair   care   products   like   other   reviews   would   lead   you   to   believe .   it   s   overpriced   for   what   you   get   and   not   impressive   at   all .
my   hair   is   still   wet !   this   hair   dryer   has   2   speed   s ,   slow   and   slower !   it   takes   forever   to   dry   hair .   instead   of   looking   forward   to   getting   ready   i   dread   washing   my   hair   knowing   how   long   it   will   take .   i   have   had   this   dryer   for   1   month   now   and   am   looking   for   a   new   one .   if   you   have   thin   hair   this   may   work   for   you ,   but   i   have   thick   wavey   hair   and   this   dryer   has   no   power   or   heat   to   style   me .   i   feel   sorry   for   the   people   who   paid   full   price   for   this   product ... this   is   no   salon   dryer ! !   very   disappointed   try   hot   tools   ceramic   hair   dryer   for   the   same   price   amazon   has   none   in   stock   at   the   moment   but   it   is   an   awesome   dryer   worth   every   penny .

love   it !   used   this   hairdryer   in   a   hotel   on   vacation   and   loved   it   so   much   i   had   to   order   one   for   home   as   soon   as   i   got   back !   doesn   t   have   a   separate   selector   for   temperature ,   and   seems   to   be   hotter   on   the   higher   setting   that   the   lower   ones ,   but   it   works   just   great   for   me .   would   definitely   recommend .
do   not   buy   online   do   not   buy   this   prodcut   online   if   something   happens   to   this   product   farouk   will   not   fix   it .   they   will   take   your   shipping   money   and   return   the   dryer   back   to   you   without   letting   you   know   that   the   product   can   not   be   fixed   within   3   weeks   of   purchasing   this   product   the   dryer   only   blew   out   cold   air   this   is   a   product   malfunction   and   they   wont   fix   it   for   me
great   hair   dryer !   i   never   realized   a   hair   dryer   could   actually   make   your   hair   feel   soft !   this   one   does   that   and   dries   my   hair   in   2   seconds .   okay   maybe   not   2   seconds ,   but   it   really   is   fast .
cord   is   too   short   after   reading   several   hair   dryer   reviews ,   i   was   very   interested   in   the   213x   model   in   this   line   asin   b000e8o8uq   conair   213x   infiniti   professional   tourmaline   ceramic   technology   ionic   styler ,   black   ,   but   my   local   retailer   had   the   223   model ,   so   i   thought   i   would   give   it   a   shot .   i   like   the   idea   of   the   retractable   cord ,   but   now   that   i   ve   used   it   once ,   i   know   that   5   is   too   short   for   my   taste .   i   was   also   expecting   a   better   dry   from   an   ionic   dryer ,   but   my   hair   didn   t   seem   any   less   frizzy .

liking   my   orange   hari   dryer   i   have   long ,   wavy   and   very   thin   hair .   it   usually   take   me   15   min   to   dry   it   and   with   this   farouk   is   just   5   min   w   minimum   frizz !   i   used   many   cheap   under   40   hair   dryer   one ,   which   all   were   a   big   disappointment .   i   bought   this   orange   farouck   2   months   ago   and   i   am   very   happy   w   it .   to   begin   with   the   price   was   wonderful   250.00   actual   price   and   i   bought   45.00   on   amazon   .   it   is   also   light   weight   and   have   soft   volume   hate   loud   hair   dryer   and   it   dries   my   hair   in   5   minutes .   if   this   dryer   had   shorter   cord   or   had   retractable   cord   i   would   give   it   5   stars .
love   it !   i   love   this   dryer !   i   ll   never   buy   a   less   expensive   one   from   a   discount   store   again .   this   one   is   quieter   and   even   though   it   doesn   t   blast   you   with   hot   air   like   the   less   quality   ones   ,   it   works   really   well .   my   best   friend   bought   it   first ,   and   her   hair   is   un   managable   most   days .   she   loves   it ,   so   i   bought   it   too ,   and   i   love   it .   a   great   deal   too !
great   price ,   great   hair   dryer !   i   originally   ordered   the   farouk   deep   brilliance   because   my   old   conair   hair   dryer   finally   went   to   hair   appliance   heaven .   this   model   was   among   the   best   reviewed   and   it   was   definitely   the   most   affordable .   i   cannot   say   that   i   find   it   to   be   a   whole   lot   different   from   other   dryers   i   have   owned   but   i   feel   like   it   dries   a   bit   faster   so   it   does   save   me   time .   my   only   complaint   is   that   i   wish   it   had   come   with   a   diffuser !
love   this   hair   dryer   i   love   this   hair   dryer .   when   i   read   the   previous   reviews   i   was   skeptical   but   i   have   heard   really   good   things   about   this   brand   so   tried   it .   this   hair   dryer   is   very   quiet   and   it   dries   very   quickly .   i   have   thick   hair   and   my   old   dryer   was   very   loud   and   it   got   very   hot   but   it   made   my   hair   feel   hard   and   burned   afterwards .   this   one   leaves   my   hair   feeling   very   soft   and   manageable .   i   love   this   hair   dryer .   the   buttons   are   in   odd   positions   but   i   love   the   dryer   anyway .
hair   dryer   review   the   hair   dryer   cuts   off   within   a   couple   minutes .   i   dry   my   hair   with   another   hair   dryer .   this   one   won   t   even   stay   on   long   enough   for   me   to   style   my   hair .   i   had   one   just   like   it   for   a   couple   years   previously .   it   worked   much   better .
good   product   i   was   skeptical ,   but   after   using   this   product , it   dries   my   hair   much   faster   and   with   less   frizz
value   mounted   very   quickly   in   the   same   holes   of   the   previous   dryer .   works   great   and   a   good   value .   previous   dryer   cost   3   times   more   and   worked   the   same .
great   gift   idea   purchased   this   for   a   gift   and   the   person   i   gave   it   to   keeps   thanking   me   for   the   purchase .   suppose   to   be   one   of   the   best   out   there .
deep   brilliance   hair   dryer   this   hair   dryer   is   wonderful !   i   was   worried   before   i   got   it   that   it   wouldn   t   have   enough   power   to   dry   my   hair   because   i   have   long   hair   that   takes   a   while   to   dry .   once   i   recieved   it   and   tried   it   out   i   fell   completely   in   love   with   it .   it   is   the   most   quiet   hair   dryer   that   i   have   owned ,   it   is   easy   to   take   the   filter   out   to   clean ,   it   doesn   t   eat   my   hair   when   it   is   too   close   to   my   head ,   it   doesn   t   burn   my   hair   but   the   best   thing   is   that   it   gets   hot   enough   to   dry   my   hair   and   has   enough   power   to   get   the   job   done   quickly .   it   does   get   a   little   heavy   after   a   while   but   what   hair   dryer   of   that   size   doesn   t   the   on   off   buttons   can   be   switched   easily   while   using   if   held   directly   by   the   buttons   but   i   haven   t   had   too   much   trouble   with   that   issue .
hair   dryer   this   was   a   replacement   for   a   jerdon   hairdryer   that   we   had   had   for   years .   the   new   one   has   a   sleeker   look ,   is   much   quieter ,   does   the   job   drying   your   hair   faster .
great   hair   dryer   i   was   skeptical   when   my   hairstylist   recommended   i   invest   in   a   ceramic   dryer ,   since   i   ve   generally   avoided   heat   styling   on   my   very   bleached   hair   for   fear   of   further   damage .   this   dryer   has   won   me   over   completely .   it   dries   my   hair   quickly   and   leaves   it   soft   again ,   having   chemically   treated ,   porous   hair   means   that   some   dryers   have   left   my   hair   feeling   crunchy   and   looking   frizzy .   not   so   with   deep   brilliance !   i   think   it   s   a   great   product   at   a   reasonable   price   40   is   a   lot   cheaper   than   most   professional   quality   ceramic   models   i   ve   looked   into .   for   someone   with   damaged   hair   needing   tlc ,   this   is   awesome .   i   can   actually   use   less   styling   products   thanks   to   the   smooth   finish   i   get   just   from   the   dryer .   i   didn   t   find   myself   wanting   more   power ,   as   some   reviewers   have   mentioned ,   but   this   may   be   because   my   hair   is   porous   and   not   terribly   thick .   the   only   negatives   i   can   think   of   would   be   that   the   styling   attachments   become   quite   hot   very   quickly   thus   you   have   to   be   careful   when   removing   them   right   after   use   ,   and   perhaps   for   someone   with   very   thick   hair ,   1300   watts   won   t   cut   it .
eh ...   could   be   5   star   if   it   had   more   blow   to   it   pros   ceramic   heating   component   lightweight   quiet   cons   the   blow   component   isn   t   all   that   strong   has   only   a   low   and   high   setting   plastic   casing   feels   cheap   but   that   s   probably   partly   why   it   s   so   light   obnoxious   color   this   could   be   a   5   star   blow   drier   if   they   had   just   given   it   a   little   more   power .   i   purchased   it   because   i   was   excited   about   the   good   reviews .   it   does   a   pretty   good   job ,   but   the   problem   is   that   the   blow   action   of   it   is   really   weak .   to   use   it   i   have   to   use   the   funneling   head   attachment ,   but   there   is   almost   no   airflow   on   the   low   setting .   because   there   isn   t   a   very   high   volume   of   air   running   through   the   dryer ,   the   air   is   also   a   bit   hotter   than   i   d   really   like   it   to   be   and   i   worry   about   damaging   my   hair ...   i   find   that   i   need   to   cut   my   hair   more   frequently   since   i   ve   purchased   this   blow   drier .   i   m   going   to   shop   around   in   the   near   future   for   a   better   dryer .   it   s   ok   for   now ,   and   if   not   for   the   ceramic   heat   i   would   have   returned   it ,   but   i   wouldn   t   get   it   again .
prefer   older   model   but   works   as   advertised .   bought   this   unit   to   replace   a   sunbeam   1500   watt   model   that   had   a   broken   fan   blade   was   dropped   on   a   tile   floor   .   i   miss   the   three   temperature   settings   available   on   the   older   model .   this   one   only   has   two .   otherwise   it   is   a   good   product .
never   had   my   hair   dry   so   quickly !   i   have   long ,   thick ,   wavy   hair   that   usually   takes   anywhere   from   30   to   40   minutes   to   blow   dry ..... with   this   blow   dryer   it   was   cut   to   15   minutes !   besides   the   time   issue   most   blow   dryers   drive   me   crazy   because   they   are   so   loud ,   not   this   one   .. it   s   much   quiter   than   the   average   blow   dryer .   i   had   seen   this   a   few   other   places   at   varying   prices   all   way   more   than   the   40   i   paid   at   amazon .   the   only   draw   back   is   that   it   s   a   little   more   heavy   than   other   blow   dryers ..... but   i   figure   that   s   good   for   my   arms !   a   great   purchase !
nice   dryer   good   buy   this   is   my   first   ion   dryer .   my   hair   does   not   seem   any   shinier   than   when   i   used   my   old   non   ion   dryer . but   amazon   s   price   can   t   be   beat ,   i   only   paid   17   for   it .   it   is   fast   i   dry   my   hair   in   aobut   15   minutes .   the   cool   setting   option   is   nice .
ver   nice   product   this   dryer   works   well   and   was   very   easy   to   install .   directions   were   very   clear   and   it   is   now   anchored   firmly   on   the   wall .   turns   off   automatically   when   dryer   is   put   back   in   holder .   this   is   a   nice   feature .   all   in   all ,   very   nice   product .
been   duped   or   i   m   missing   something ..   i   absolutely   don   t   understand   the   positive   reviews   for   this   hairdryer .   did   i   receive   the   wrong   hairdryer   or   something   for   starters ,   how   can   the   product   description   say   lightweight   this   thing   is   so   bulky   and   heavy ! !   and   because   it   takes   so   long   to   dry   my   hair   with   this   thing ,   the   heaviness   of   it   sure   doesn   t   help .   it   s   apparently   1800   watts ,   but   it   feels   like   it   s   half   that .   i   m   giving   it   two   stars   because   for   one ,   it   s   incredibly   quiet   and   i   ve   never   heard   a   dryer   this   quiet   and   two ,   my   hair   was   a   bit   less   frizzy   than   with   my   previous   ionic   dryer .   but   these   two   pros   aren   t   worth   the   cons .   i   don   t   see   anything   special   about   this   dryer   and   my   mother   s   1875   watt   conair   dryer   beats   this   any   day .   also ,   has   anyone   done   any   research   on   this   product   google   it .   have   you   noticed   that   it   isn   t   sold   in   any   salons ,   on   the   farouk   website ,   or   anywhere   else   where   you   can   see   it   s   original   259.95   price   i   believe   this   is   a   cheaper ,   dumbed   down   version   of   a   quality ,   more   expensive   farouk   product   that   has   been   released   at   a   cheaper   price   so   that   the   company   has   a   range   of   affordable   to   higher   end   priced   products   to   widen   their   consumer   base   and   profits .   nothing   wrong   with   that ,   but   i   m   just   trying   to   say   that   this   definitely   isn   t   some   260   dollar   amazing   hairdryer .   the   whole   deep   brilliance   line   seems   to   be   a   cheaper ,   more   affordable   version   of   farouk   products   that   are   being   advertised   as   if   they   are   more   higher   end ,   originally   higher   priced   items .   i   dunno ,   try   and   find   it   somewhere   where   it   was   originally   259.95   or   even   for   any   other   price .   i   sure   as   hell   couldn   t   find   it .   try   the   hairdryer   for   yourself ,   this   is   just   my   two   cents .
best   darn   hair   dryer   i   ve   ever   had ! ! !   none   available .
not   bad   but   not   great .   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   close   to   a   month   ago .   overall   i   am   satisfied   with   the   dryer   itself .   the   built   in   nightlight   i   thought   would   help   me   save   from   taking   up   another   outlet   for   a   separate   nightlight .   however ,   the   nightlight   stopped   working   after   only   about   5   days .   it   still   comes   on   occasionally   when   it   feels   like   it   .   when   it   is   on ,   it   is   very   bright .   one   other   improvement   i   would   like   to   see   is   where   it   plugs   into   the   wall .   i   would   like   to   see   a   90   degree   plug   so   that   the   cord   does   not   stick   out   so   far   from   the   wall .   for   my   particluar   bathroom   setup ,   the   cord   sticking   out   gets   in   my   way .   not   bad   for   the   price   though .
farouk   hair   dryer   this   hair   dryer   worked   better   than   i   expected .   i   have   long   hair   that   easily   gets   frizzed   from   overdrying .   this   hair   dryer   gave   just   enough   heat   to   dry   my   hair   fastly   and   did   not   frizz   my   hair .   this   hair   dryer   is   well   worth   the   money .
infiniti   by   conair   223   cord   reel   folding   handle   dryer   i   have   been   through   a   lifetime   of   hairdryers   and   this   one   tops   the   list !   it   s   powerful   but   doesn   t   blast   your   hair   beyond   recognition ... especially   at   the   lower   speed   and   on   warm .   not   having   to   deal   with   wrapping   up   the   cord   is   such   a   plus ... the   retractable   cord   works   beautifully   and   saves   space   in   my   small   bathroom .
horrible   if   you   value   your   hearing   do   not   buy   this   item .   it   was   so   loud   that   the   first   time   i   used   it ,   it   was   unbearable .   i   was   excited   to   have   a   wall   mount   dryer ,   but   not   worth   it   at   the   extreme   noise   it   makes .   i   put   it   into   my   yard   sale   box   and   sold   it .
no   problems ,   great   dryer   this   is   a   great   hair   dryer   it   works   fast   and   my   hair   has   never   looked   better .   i   never   thouht   i   would   spend   that   much   on   a   dryer ,   but   it   has   been   well   worth   it .   i   almost   didn   t   get   it   because   of   the   reviews   on   here   about   unauthorized   dealers   and   whatnot .   it   was   a   great   price   though   so   i   went   ahead   anyway .   i   m   glad   i   did !   i   don   t   know   if   somethng   changed ,   or   if   those   reviewers   were   just   looking   in   the   wrong   place   for   the   serial   number ,   but   mine   had   everything   needed   in   order   to   register   it   with   no   problems .
buy   this   one !   this   wall   mounted   hair   dryer   is   so   nice ...   i   also   have   the   sunbeam   1500   but   i   prefer   this   one .   it   easily   comes   off   the   cradle ,   it   is   fairly   quiet   compared   to   the   sunbeam   and   the   design   is   just   more   user   friendly .   spend   the   extra   few   bucks   on   this   one !   it   s   a   great   product .
farouk   hair   dryer   im   very   happy   with   this   dryer . it   is   just   as   good   as   my   chi   dryer . the   shipping   was   very   fast . the   price   was   excellent . i   would   highly   recommend   this   dryer .   im   a   hairdresser   and   everyone   i   work   with   was   intersted   in   it   when   they   saw   the   color   of   it . it   really   works   just   as   good   as   my   old   chi   dryer .
farouk   hair   dryer   love   this   item .   very   quiet   you   will   love   it  
great   dryer   this   is   a   great   dryer .   it   blows   hard   which   is   what   i   wanted .   i   have   short   bleached   hair .   i   don   t   use   the   attachments .   i   haven   t   noticed   that   the   ion   feature   has   done   anything   different   for   my   hair .   it   has   a   nice   long   cord   which   i   also   like .   some   reviewers   have   mentioned   it   being   heavy .   not   true ,   maybe   for   a   three   year   old ,   but   not   an   adult .   it   just   feels   like   a   nice   solid ,   well   made   dryer .   it   s   louder   than   my   last   dryer ,   but   not   too   loud .   i   don   t   think   that   whole   ion   thing   does   anything   no   matter   which   dryer   you   use .   my   hair   is   the   same ,   with   or   without   ions .   what   smooths   it   out   is   the   fact   that   it   blows   nice   and   hard .   that   will   probably   change   though   as   the   filter   gets   clogged   inside .   that   remains   to   be   seen .   i   m   happy   with   it .
farouk   deep   brilliance   this   is   a   nice   dryer .   it   dries   hair   in   about   half   the   time   as   others   i   have   used .   it   would   have   been   really   nice   if   it   had   come   with   a   diffuser   though .   i   can   t   find   a   diffuser   that   fits   this ,   so   i   have   not   gotten   to   use   it   on   myself   yet .   but   it   dries   my   nieces   hair   much   faster   than   other   dryers .

great   while   it   lasted   loved   that   it   had   three   heat   settings   and   two   speeds .   did   what   a   dryer   was   suppose   to   do .   however ,   it   is   a   bit   noisy   and   it   crapped   out   on   me   pretty   quickly .   from   other   reviews ,   i   would   say   don   t   buy   it   if   you   want   a   hair   dryer   that   lasts   more   than   a   year   to   two   years   max .

elchim   hair   dryer   great   dryer .   works   much   faster   than   my   old   conair   did ,   and   does   not   leave   my   wavy   hair   frizzy .   i   noticed   that   i   did   not   need   to   use   my   flat   iron   following   use   of   this   dryer   unless   i   just   wanted   to ,   which   is   great   less   heat   damage   .   having   only   had   the   product   for   about   a   month   or   so ,   i   can   t   speak   to   the   longevity   of   this   product ,   of   course ,   but   it   seems   quite   durable   in   comparison   to   drug   store   brands .   the   shipping   was   incredibly   fast ,   i   must   add .
happy   but   wish   it   was   a   little   stronger ...   we   wanted   one   of   these   after   staying   in   a   hotel   that   had   them .   the   one   in   the   hotel   blew   a   lot   harder   than   this .   still   i   am   pleased   with   the   dryer   and   we   even   got   a   free   upgrade .   the   box   ours   was   in   was   labeled   as   this   one ,   but   what   was   inside   was   actually   the   ionizing   version .   nice   bonus ,   but   not   sure   if   it   really   helps .   still   identical   in   specs .   one   thing   i   had   to   do   was   take   the   back   off   and   bend   around   most   of   the   led   s   used   in   the   nightlight .   i   also   colored   the   inside   of   the   clear   plastic   with   a   sharpie .   this   was   to   reduce   the   brightness   of   the   night   light .   it   would   have   been   handy   for   a   hallway   bathroom   but   was   too   bright   for   our   bedroom .   we   love   it   after   the   modification .

a   very   good   hair   dryer ... but   a   little   too   loud .   i   ve   found   this   hair   dryer   to   meet   my   needs   drying   my   longer   hair ,   and   it   s   a   much   appreciated   lighter   weight   than   my   last   one .   however ,   i   do   wish   it   was   a   little   quieter   on   high   speed ,   or   else   have   a   medium   speed   setting   to   select .
best   hairdryer   ever !   this   is   the   best   hairdryer   i   have   ever   owned .   i   have   waist   length   chemically   straightened   hair   that   is   normally   thick   course   and   curly   hair .   i   have   about   5   inches   of   curly   re   growth   and   i   don   t   need   to   use   my   flat   iron   to   blend   it   in   with   my   straitened   hair .   this   dryer   dries   super   fast   and   leaves   hair   soft   and   less   frizzy .   very   quie   too .   i   use   minimal   product   on   my   hair   now   with   this   dyer .   well   worth   the   money .   i   m   buying   one   as   a   back   up   and   have   recommended   it   to   many   of   my   friends .   love   it !
worked   great   until ....   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   about   a   month   ago .   it   worked   great !   dried   my   hair   quickly   with   no   problems .   then   one   day ,   i   plugged   it   in   to   use   it   and   nothing   happened .   the   hair   dryer   wouldn   t   work .   i   pressed   the   reset   button   and   tried   everything .   luckily   i   kept   my   old   hair   dryer   a   revlon   just   in   case !   i   would   not   buy   this   product   again ... i   contacted   conair   a   week   ago   and   they   said   i   d   hear   back   in   3   business   days ... haven   t   heard   anything   yet .   very   disappointed .
wow !   who   knew   a   hair   dryer   could   make   such   a   difference !   loved   this   hair   dryer !   didn   t   even   need   a   new   hair   dryer ,   but   at   this   price ,   i   couldn   t   resist .   i   figured   my   old   one   would   break   eventually .   i   decided   to   make   sure   it   worked ,   in   case   i   needed   to   return   it .   wow !   i   couldn   t   believe   how   soft   my   hair   was !   my   hair   is   healthy ,   shoulder   length ,   a   little   wave ,   a   little   frizz .   i   usually   had   to   tame   with   biosilk   silk   therapy   after   drying .   but   with   this   dryer ,   i   don   t   need   to   use   anything !   my   hair   is   silky ,   bouncy ,   soft   and   pretty .   it   dries   faster   than   my   old   one   and   it   s   quieter   big   plus   since   my   baby   s   bedroom   is   right   next   to   the   bathroom .  
love   it   just   what   you   would   expect   for   a   250   blow   dryer ! ! !   i   work   at   a   hair   salon   and   have   told   all   of   the   girls   about   this   deal !   the   air   is   hot   hot   hot ,   it   dries   my   hair   very   quickly   and   my   hair   is   no   longer   frizzy   and   a   knotted   mess   after   i   blow   dry   it .   it   is   sooooo   quiet   which   is   exactly   what   i   needed   my   other   dryer   was   incredibly   loud   .   this   dryer   doesnt   even   sound   like   it   is   on .   it   has   a   low   high ,   and   2   heat   settings ...   its   working   great   for   me !   i   would   highly   recommend .
good   and   quiet !   this   blow   dyer   is   the   best   and   a   deal   at   this   price !   i   used   it   and   it   was   so   quiet   i   couldnt   believe   it .   it   also   took   no   time   to   dry   my   hair   even   on   the   medium   setting .   i   have   thick   ethnic   hair   and   it   left   it   very   manageable   and   soft .   i   recommend   this   dryer .   its   not   a   looker   but   it   gets   the   job   done .   whoever   said   it   was   heavy   is   mistaken ,   its   not   heavy   at   all .   the   comb   attachment   is   great   also .
wrong   item   the   picture   on   the   web   page   didn   t   match   the   model   number .   i   returned   the   item   and   they   reimbursed   me .
love   it !   this   hair   dryer   is   the   best !   it   dries   your   hair   in   half   the   time   a   regular   hair   dryer   would   do   it .   it   really   helps   for   an   on   the   go   mom !
conair   hairdryer   it   is   okay .   it   doesn   t   get   hot   enough   and   the   buttons   are   located   where   you   hit   them   with   your   fingers .   i   am   not   crazy   about   it   and   certainly   would   want   more   heat   fromit
hair   dryer   t3   is   the   best   hair   dryer   i   have   ever   owned .   i   m   a   50   something   professional   with   thinning ,   color   treated   hair   that   is   frizzy   and   easily   dried   out .   this   machine   leaves   my   hair   shiny ,   fuller   and   healthy   looking   with   no   friz .   feel   like   i   have   a   new   head   of   hair .   will   buy   a   2nd   dryer   for   the   office .
loved   it   at   first   but   then   it   started   shooting   out   sparks !   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   after   doing   a   ton   of   research   and   thought   it   would   be   a   good   investment .   when   i   first   started   using   it ,   it   worked   great .   i   was   amazed   at   how   quickly   it   dried   my   hair   and   how   shiny   it   looked   afterwards .   i   have   naturally   curly   hair   and   prefer   it   straight   so   i   used   this   to   dry   it   straight   along   with   a   round   brush   and   it   did   the   job   amazingly   well .   br   br   well   i   had   this   for   a   little   over   a   year   when   all   of   a   sudden   one   day   it   started   shooting   out   some   sparks .   i   couldn   t   believe   it .   i   turned   it   on   another   day   just   to   see   if   it   even   turned   on   and   it   did   but   you   could   see   the   coils   in   it   started   to   get   red   and   then   shoot   out   some   sparks .   this   wasn   t   even   overused   or   anything .   in   fact   since   i   was   pregnant   at   the   time   i   bought   it ,   i   had   a   hard   time   standing   up   for   too   long   so   i   only   used   it   once   or   twice   a   week .   after   that   little   use   it   was   already   not   working   properly   in   just   over   a   year .   in   fact ,   for   about   4   months   out   of   that   first   year ,   i   didn   t   even   use   it   right   after   i   had   my   son .   that   was   way   too   short   of   a   time   and   too   much   money   spent   on   an   item   that   wasn   t   working   properly .   br   br   i   am   very   diasspointed   with   this   and   will   never   buy   anything   by   this   company   ever   again .   br   br   if   you   need   a   good   hairdryer ,   look   elsewhere .   i   m   just   glad   and   lucky   that   the   sparks   didn   t   land   on   my   hair   and   cause   a   fire   or   anything .
superb   oh   my   gosh ... this   hair   dryer   is   so   perfect .   i   opened   the   box   the   night   it   arrived   at   my   door .   took   out   my   new   hairdryer ,   plugged   it   in ,   and   wow !   you   could   just   feel   the   power ,   yet   so   quiet ,   but   so   strong !   it   heated   up   immediated .   it   s   very   well   made   of   high   quality   materials .   take   it   from   me ,   i   am   one   of   the   biggest   sceptics   you   could   ever   meet .   i   love   this   hair   dryer   so   much ,   i   am   afraid   to   show   it   to   one   of   my   dearest   friends   for   fear   of   hurting   her   feelings ,   as   she   just   got   a   new   pink   chi   hair   dryer   for   christmas .   personally ,   i   do   believe   this   is   the   same   exact   hair   dryer ,   it   just   doesn   t   have   chi   printed   on   the   side   of   it .   who   doesn   t   love   orange ... go   illini .   thanks   again   amazon   for   carrying   such   high   quality   products ... i   am   thrilled   that   i   have   found   you .
i   guarantee   this   dryer   will   be   recalled !   on   the   first   use   following   their   instruction   booklet   exactly   ,   this   dryer   burned   off   whole   sections   of   my   hair .   after   complaining   to   revlon ,   i   was   instructed   to   contact   the   manufacturer ,   helen   of   troy .   frankly ,   if   you   re   going   to   put   your   name   on   something   my   feeling   is   that   you   should   stand   by   the   product   yourself   and   not   send   consumers   on   a   wild   goose   chase   to   track   down   the   responsible   party !   instead   i   contacted   the   us   consumer   product   safety   commission   via   email   and   i   received   a   phonecall   from   them .   they   sent   an   agent   out   to   my   home ,   purchased   this   dangerous   dryer   for   cash ,   took   pictures   of   all   the   burnt   hair   yes ,   i   saved   all   evidence   and   i   expect   as   there   are   many   complaints   about   this   product   they   will   soon   recall   it .   don   t   buy   this   dryer   or   any   other   revlon   hair   products .   they   are   faulty   and   revlon   does   not   care   about   customer   service ,   either .
ideal   hair   dryer !   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   in   hopes   that   it   would   do   a   better   job   than   my   old   revlon   ceramic   ion   dryer .   my   hair   is   almost   shoulder   length ,   very   textured   and   thick .   with   my   old   revlon   it   took   me   20   minutes   to   dry   my   hair .   i   ve   been   using   this   dryer   for   one   week   now   and   it   takes   about   8   minutes   to   dry   my   hair .   while   it   dries   hair   quickly ,   it   s   extremely   gently   and   leaves   my   hair   softer   and   more   manageable   than   it   has   been   in   a   very   long   time .   i   m   thrilled   with   its   performance   and   the   price   can   t   be   beat !
would   not   buy   this   item   again   i   like   the   convenance   of   it   hanging   on   the   wall   and   the   night   light   is   nice .   but   it   doesn   t   seem   like   a   1600   watt   hair   dryer .   it   has   very   little   power   and   the   power   switch   tends   to   turn   off   if   you   don   t   hold   the   handle   just   right   during   use .
great   buy !   if   you   want   a   high   end   hair   dryer   for   the   right   price ,   you   ve   come   to   the   right   place !   i   was   looking   into   chi   hairdryers   200   300   when   i   found   this   one   by   farouk .   i   decided   to   go   ahead   and   try   it   out ,   and   i   love   it !   the   comb   attachment   is   my   favorite   part   it   kind   of   massages   my   head   while   i   use   it   and   it   makes   my   hair   less   frizzy   and   that   s   saying   something   since   i   live   in   texas !   .   the   nozzle   attachment   is   also   easy   to   use   and   gives   a   great   blowout .   it   s   just   a   great   hair   dryer   and   i   recommend   it   to   anyone !
farouk   deep   brilliance   professional   hair   dryer   it   takes   half   the   time   to   dry   my   hair   and   is   very   quiet .   i   like   the   fact   that   you   can   clean   the   air   filter   as   apposed   to   my   previous   hair   dryers !   would   highly   recommend !
hard   to   believe   it   could   be   so   good   i   bought   this   dryer   based   on   the   user   reviews   and   am   very   pleased .   it   has   a   lot   of   drying   power .   it   s   light .   it   s   quiet .   it   s   nicely   balanced .   it   s   not   necessary   to   grip   the   handle   to   hold   the   dryer .   it   will   balance   in   the   crook   of   your   left   thumb ,   so   your   hand   and   arm   won   t   get   tired   from   holding   it .   i   can   t   say   for   certain ,   since   i   don   t   have   carpal   tunnel   syndrome ,   but   this   may   be   a   great   dryer   for   people   who   suffer   from   it   since   there   s   no   need   to   clinch   a   fist   to   hold   it .   though   i   was   at   first   disappointed   that   i   can   t   remove   the   screens   to   clean   them   and   will   need   to   do   it   with   the   vacuum   cleaner   i   later   decided   that   for   price   and   performance ,   this   is   a   pretty   great   dryer .
i   m   buying   it ...   again .   i   purchased   this   dryer   almost   2   years   ago .   just   yesterday   the   switch   broke   it   was   a   very   sad   day .   after   trying   out   at   least   5   other   dryers ,   i   found   this   to   be   by   far   the   best   for   the   money .   it   is   relatively   quiet   for   the   airflow   it   produces   no   hi   pitched   whine   like   some   other   models .   and   it   is   very   powerful !   it   is   heavier   than   others ,   but   i   don   t   mind   getting   a   little   extra   muscle   tone .   it   doesn   t   have   a   shiny   plastic   finish   and   can   withstand   being   dropped   many   times   on   a   tile   bathroom   floor   trust   me .   br   br   i   have   long ,   fine   hair   that   will   get   unruly   and   curly   against   my   wishes   unless   dried   a   certain   way .   the   high   blower   setting   with   medium   heat   works   great   for   me ,   plus   i   use   the   cold   shot   and   a   big   roller   brush   to   create   volume .   it   is   very   versatile ,   with   two   blower   settings   and   three   heat   settings .   br   br   wish   the   one   i   had   would   have   lasted ,   but   i   m   not   taking   any   chances   with   another   dryer .   this   works   as   well   as   any   100   dryer   as   far   as   i   m   concerned .   only   gripes   are   1   the   switch   breaking   and   2   the   cord   is   long   great   but   it   tends   to   get   all   twisted   up   on   itself   even   though   it   was   designed   not   to .   for   these   reasons   it   fell   just   short   of   5   stars   br   br   update   november   2013   well ,   i   bought   it   again .   this   one   lasted   for   five   and   a   half   years !   it   bit   the   dust ,   and   actually   produced   flames   on   it   s   way   out !   they   may   have   originated   from   the   switch   mechanism .   it   was   a   quite   spectacular ,   and   quite   frightening ,   way   for   it   to   go .   because   of   safety   concerns ,   i   will   not   be   purchasing   this   hair   dryer   again .
great   deal ,   great   driver   great   little   dryer   with   lots   of   power .   compact   size   and   wall   mount   save   space .   don   t   let   that   compact   size   deceive   you ,   though ,   because   it   dries   hair   very   quickly .
t3   featherweight   revlon   tourmaline   comparison   i   bought   the   t3   featherweight   for   my   wife   as   a   christmas   gift   for   my   wife .   she   has   extremely   thick   hair   and   drying   it   takes   a   very   long   time .   after   purchasing   the   t3   from   an   authorized   dealer ,   i   found   the   good   housekeeping   review   that   gave   a   favorable   review   of   the   revlon   tourmaline   ionic .   since   the   revlon   is   1   10th   the   cost ,   i   bought   one   at   target   and   gave   both   to   my   wife   for   christmas .   i   was   hoping   that   she   would   find   the   revlon   comparable   and   we   could   save   the   expense   of   the   t3 .   no   such   luck .   she   first   used   to   t3   and   found   that   it   was   much   quieter   than   her   current   dryer   and   that   it   reduced   the   time   it   took   to   dry   her   hair   by   about   10   minutes .   when   she   next   used   the   revlon ,   she   ended   up   burning   her   hair   and   refuses   to   ever   use   it   again .   she   s   been   using   the   t3   for   about   three   weeks   as   remains   very   happy   with   it .   being   the   more   analytical   one ,   i   decided   to   do   a   scientific   comparison   between   the   two .   note   that   i   only   had   one   sample   of   each   dryer   and   i   didn   t   use   calibrated   instruments ,   so   these   observations   are   only   useful   in   comparing   the   two   samples   that   i   had .   the   first   and   most   important   difference   concerned   the   temperature   of   the   air   exiting   these   two   dryers   while   set   for   high   output   and   hot   temperature .   the   t3   held   a   fairly   consistent   temperature   that   most   of   the   time   fell   between   190   and   210   degrees .   extremes   fell   between   180   and   230   degrees ,   but   these   were   for   only   a   second   or   two   before   the   temperature   returned   to   200   10   degrees .   the   revlon   was   much   less   consistent .   its   temperature   continuously   fluctuated   between   130   and   235   degrees .   once   i   observed   the   temperature   spike   to   almost   260   degrees .   i   must   have   been   one   of   these   spikes   the   burned   my   wife   s   hair .   i   took   measurements   over   three   different   periods   and   noticed   wide   fluctuation   during   each   one .   keep   in   mind   that   i   only   had   one   sample   of   each   dryer   so   these   problems   may   be   caused   by   a   defective   unit   and   not   indicative   of   the   entire   line .   both   dryers   are   very   quietcompared   to   those   that   my   wife   has   used   in   the   past .   the   t3   ran   at   about   100   decibels   at   the   intake   and   output   ends   and   about   90   decibels   on   the   side .   from   one   foot   away ,   the   dryer   ran   from   78   to   84   decibels .   the   revlon   was   a   little   louder ,   running   about   105db   at   the   ends   to   90db   on   the   side .   from   one   foot ,   it   in   ranged   from   82   89   decibels .   these   measurements   were   taken   in   our   bathroom   which   has   almost   no   sound   absorption .   the   revlon   did   push   out   more   air .   on   the   high   settings ,   the   air   exiting   the   revlon   had   almost   twice   the   force   of   that   of   the   t3 .   on   the   low   setting ,   t3   had   about   75   of   the   force   of   the   revlon .   bottom   line   the   revlon   had   temperature   problems   and   burned   my   wife   s   hair .   if   that   could   be   fixed ,   it   would   be   a   great   dryer   as   it   s   1   10   the   cost   on   the   t3 .   but ,   right   now ,   there   s   no   way   my   wife   is   going   to   give   up   her   t3 .
cord   keeper   breaks !   i   researched   all   the   hairdryers   on   amazon ,   and   this   one   seemed   like   a   great   product   at   a   great   price .   unfortunately ,   one   huge   design   flaw   has   prevented   me   from   using   it .   the   cord   keeper   function   broke   after   about   3   months   of   use ,   so   in   order   to   use   it   i   have   to   either   1   be   within   12   inches   of   the   socket ,   or   2   i   have   to   fold   the   cord   up   after   pulling   it   out   and   hold   on   tight   the   entire   time   i   m   drying .   a   very   frustrating   experience .   buyers ... beware .
happy   user   i   have   used   this   dryer   for   almost   3   years   now .   my   daughter   liked   it   so   much   that   i   bought   this   for   her   this   christmas .   she   now   is   as   happy   as   i   am .   it   is   fairly   light   weight   but   has   the   power   of   a   professional .
conair   209r   ion   shine   s   for   under   20.00 !   you   can   t   get   much   for   20   these   days .   however ,   an   andrew   jackson   will   get   you   the   conair   209r   ion   shine   1875   watt   hair   dryer   from   amazon . com ,   and   your   even   have   some   change   left   over !   this   dryer   produces   an   impressive   jet   stream   of   air ,   with   a   selection   of   3   heat   settings .   the   technical   specifications   boast   clouds   of   negatively   charged   ions   neutralize   positive   charges   that   are   in   the   air   and   reduce   the   static   electricity   that   causes   fly   away   frizzies   and   dulls   hair .   well ,   i   don   t   know   what   all   of   that   means   but   i   will   admit   that   my   hair   is   not   frizzy   after   using   this   dryer .   there   is   also   a   cold   shot   button ,   which   quickly   removes   heat   from   the   air   output ,   which   is   a   great   feature .   the   dryer   has   a   little   weight   to   it ,   but   it   is   not   bulky   and   seems   to   be   balanced   quite   well .   all   hair   dryers   are   fairly   noisey   but   this   conair   209r   ion   shine   is   quieter   than   most   of   my   previous   dryers .   br   br   one   of   my   favorite   features   of   this   model ,   the   built   in   cord   retractor ,   seems   to   be   getting   negative   comments   from   other   reviewers   here   on   amazon .   common   sense   tells   me   that   i   should   hold   onto   the   heavy   power   adapter   with   one   hand   while   holding   in   the   cord   release   buttong   with   the   other .   you   easily   control   the   retraction   speed   this   way ,   which   prevents   the   end   from   whipping   around   as   most   people   are   complaining   about .   it   s   really   not   a   big   deal   and   doesn   t   take   much   effort   on   the   user   s   part .   br   br   i   do   wish   that   this   dryer   had   three   air   speed   settings ,   since   high   is   sometimes   too   harsh ,   and   the   low   setting   is   usually   too   soft .   overall ,   for   less   than   20.00   this   is   a   real   bargain   of   a   hair   dryer   and   i   couldn   t   be   much   happier   with   my   purchase .   thanks   for   the   great   deal   amazon !   o  
great   dryer   this   has   cut   down   on   my   drying   time   and   is   very   gentle   to   my   hair .   while   it   is   expensive ,   it   is   well   worth   it .
terrific   hair   dryer ,   with   caveat   works   great   same   dryer   used   by   my   hair   stylist .   here   s   the   caveat   since   i   bought   it   from   discountjungle   via   amazon . com ,   the   manufacturer   would   not   honor   their   4   year   warranty .   they   told   me   they   only   warranty   products   sold   at   full   retail   cost   by   their   authorized   vendors ,   adding   that   hair   dryers   sold   by   amazon . com   or   by   discountjungle   were   often   used   not   new   or   knock   off   copies   of   their   product .   the   manufacturer   strongly   recommended   that   i   return   the   product   to   discountjungle ,   and   buy   one   from   their   website ,   or   from   nordstrom   one   of   their   few   vendors   then   the   manufacturer   assured   me   they   would   warranty   the   hair   dryer .   i   phoned   discountjungle ,   explained   all   this   to   them ,   and   was   assured   that   mine   was   brand   new   sure   looked   new   to   me   ,   and   that   discountjungle   would   honor   the   4   year   warranty .   i   got   that   in   writing   from   them ,   and   then   i   was   able   to   start   using   the   hair   dryer .   it   was   no   fun   going   through   all   this .   just   be   prepared ...
my   new   best   friend !   with   a   four   year   warranty   i   had   to   try   it   and   now   i   m   in   love .   it   doesn   t   take   an   hour   for   me   to   dry   my   hair .. without   blowing   all   of   my   curls   apart   in   a   big   frizzy   mess .   it   is   one   of   the   lightest   full   size   hair   dryers   that   i   ve   owned .   it   is   reasonably   quiet   and   the   buttons   are   in   the   right   spot   and   don   t   accidentally   turn   on   and   off   while   drying .   i   have   long   permed   curls   and   having   a   good   hair   dryer   can   make   or   break   my   day .   after   many   throw   away   dryers   i   think   i   have   found   a   new   best   friend .
greatly   disappointed   my   husband   got   me   this   expensive   blow   dryer   for   christmas   after   hearing   me   complain   how   long   it   takes   to   dry   my   long   hair ..   that   of   which   i   recently   chopped   6   inches   off .   i   have   a   new   baby ,   and   would   rather   spend   my   time   with   her   instead   of   drying   my   hair   so   this   seemed   like   the   perfect   product .   i   have   long ,   fine   ish ,   straight   ish   hair .   after   giving   this   dryer   a   good   week   for   a   test   drive ,   my   hair   only   seemed   flatter   and   had   more   static .   just   to   make   sure   it   wasn   t   the   weather   or   my   shampoo ,   i   tried   my   ol   20   conair   and   the   life   came   back   to   my   hair !   bottom   line   feel   free   to   try   it   out ,   but   i   m   spending   my   money   elsewhere .   also   be   warned   about   the   serial   number   missing ! !
simply   the   best   blow   dryer   on   the   market   this   is   the   best   standard   blow   dryer   on   the   market . plenty   of   power   and   heat . nothing   else   compares . this   will   keep   that   80   s   hair   blown   back   for   shure . this   was   made   for   bon   jovi   rod   stewart   types .
a   good   item   for   the   price   i   love   the   way   this   hair   dryer   works   on   my   hair   way   less   frizzies   than   my   regular   old   hair   dryer .   the   cord   is   extra   long   and   the   bright   orange   color   is   wow .   however ,   the   unit   is   a   bit   heavier   than   what   i   m   used   to .   also ,   the   location   of   the   hi ,   low   and   off   button   is   such   that   i   find   myself   accidentally   changing   the   heat   setting   while   in   use .   otherwise ,   i   love   this   produce   and   highly   recommend   it .
it   doesn   t   come   on .   what   a   pure   waste   of   my   money   i   made   this   order .   after   i   got   it ,   i   found   out   it   wasn   t   working .   i   plugged   it   it   refused   to   come   on .   it   was   a   pure   waste   of   my   money   because   what   s   the   point   if   i   can   t   use   it .   i   should   have   gotten   something   better   or   more   mature .   now   i   regret   buying   it .
i   love   this   hairdryer   this   is   a   great   dryer .   dries   my   hair   very   fast   and   seems   to   help   with   static   electricity .   it   s   a   little   pricey   but   if   you   have   long   hair   it   s   worth   it .
good   hot   air   this   is   a   good   high   end   hair   dryer   at   a   cheap   hair   dryer   price .   after   my   last   cheap   one   stopped   working ,   i   saw   this   and   figured   i   would   splurge .   why   i   am   happy ...   it   is   light   and   quiet .   it   dries   hair   quickly .   it   has   a   long   cord .   the   comb   attachement   is   handy   and   securly   clicks   on .   it   is   bright   orange   so   you   will   not   lose   it   both   myself   and   dd   have   fizzy   hair .   after   drying   her   hair   with   the   comb   attachment   is   was   softer   and   less   frizzy .   the   result   was   wow .   my   hair .... used   the   dryer   as   i   was   brushing   my   teeth   and   wiping   down   the   counter   so   it   still   came   out   frizzy   but   when   i   used   my   chi   iron   on   it ,   the   process   was   quicker   and   my   hair   was   smoother .   this   is   a   good   product .
easy   to   use   and   store   only   problem   is   it   takes   some   pressure   to   release   the   button   for   the   cord   to   recoil ,   but   that   is   about   it .   i   like   it   and   it   works   great !
great   product !   this   is   a   great   product   i   wish   i   had   bought   it   years   ago !   works   great ,   was   easy   to   install   i   love   it !
excellent !   i   am   very   impressed   by   this   blow   dryer .   i   have   had   blow   dryers   before   which   i   have   purchased   at   target   or   walgreens   but   when   my   current   one   broke   i   thought   i   would   try   a   more   expensive   one .   i   was   even   happier   to   get   a   more   expensive   one   at   a   great   price .   this   dryer   dries   the   hair   fast   without   frizzing   it   out .   the   hair   dries   soft   and   maintains   shine .   my   hair   felt   so   much   more   silkier   than   with   my   other   blow   dryer .   the   dyer   is   also   light   weight   which   is   a   plus .   i   now   know   it   pays   to   get   a   more   expensive   model .   you   won   t   be   disappointed   with   this   one .
hair   dryer   i   was   really   surprised   when   i   gotr   this   hair   dryer .   it   was   way   better   than   what   i   expected   for   the   price .   i   was   really   thrilled   and   i   am   really   satisfied   with   this   product
awesome   i   absolutely   love   this   hairdryer .   my   hair   is   healthier ,   shinier   and   i   feel   like   i   m   done   in   no   time !
piece   of   rubbish   i   was   really   looking   forward   to   this .   got   it   in   the   mail .   plugged   it   in   and   it   did   not   work .   i   am   sending   it   back .
really   smoothes   out   your   hair   i   have   very   thick   coarse   hair   and   i   usually   just   let   my   hair   air   dry   because   a   blow   dryer   makes   it   look   puffy   and   takes   so   long   that   my   arms   get   tired .   this   dryer   really   does   dry   your   hair   fast   and   it   made   my   hair   look   very   smooth .   my   husband   who   notices   nothing ,   usually   even   asked   me   what   i   had   done   to   make   my   hair   look   so   great .   the   retractible   cord   is   nice   because   it   lets   you   store   the   dryer   in   less   space   without   fighting   with   the   cord .
who   knew   that   it   was   possible   to   love   a   hairdryer   lightweight   and   super   fast .   with   a   vented   roll   brush ,   this   leaves   my   hair   looking   sleek   and   healthy   in   record   time .   i   can   t   remember   the   last   time   that   i   left   the   house   with   a   completely   dry   head   of   hair ... it   used   to   take   way   too   long   to   dry .   not   anymore !   i   also   like   the   little   bling   added   to   the   handle   of   this   special   edition   se   model .   worth   every   penny .

people   think   i   got   a   new   haircut !   not   only   does   this   dry   my   hair   faster   than   my   older   dryer ,   and   it   s   light ,   it   actually   creates   lasting   body   for   my   fine   straight   hair   that   i   ve   never   had ,   and   leaves   it   shiny   and   looking   like   a   million   bucks .   best   130   i   ve   spent   in   a   long   time ,   and   cheaper   than   more   frequent   hair   cuts ,   that   s   for   sure .
just   what   i   expected   unit   was   compact   and   stylish .   unlike   most ,   it   had   a   magnetic   mount   to   hold   unit   in   place   where   most   might   have   cheap   clips   that   can   break .   my   only   complaint   is   the   mounting   bracket   does   not   hold   unit   tightly   and   seems   unstable .   i   put   an   additional   screw   through   the   unit   to   hold   it   to   the   wall   securely .
great   dryer   my   hair   gets   dry   and   brittle   very   easily .   since   i   was   younger   i   ve   avoided   using   hair   dryers ,   except   for   in   the   winter ,   because   they   would   make   my   hair   so   dry   it   would   look   gray .   i   decided   to   purchase   this   hair   dryer   due   to   its   advertised   features .   i   was   not   disappointed .   i   have   had   long   hair   down   to   mid   thigh   all   my   life   and   it   takes   only   10   15   minutes   to   dry   with   this   dryer .   i   was   so   happy   with   the   dryer   i   decided   to   buy   one   for   my   mom   who   also   has   long   hair   for   christmas .   i   would   recommend   this   hair   dryer   to   anyone   who   has   long ,   or   light   colored   hair   that   gets   frizzy   or   looks   overly   dry   easily ...   especially   in   the   winter   months   if   you   live   in   the   north   like   i   do .   the   filter   works   well   and   is   easily   cleaned .   the   dryer   itself   is   quieter   than   any   other   hair   dryer   that   i   ve   owned .   great   buy .   very   happy .
very   compact ,   dries   well ,   stays   out   of   the   way   pros   fits   well   in   hand   and   is   easily   maneuverable   puts   out   high   volumes   of   air   at   a   high   enough   temperature   very   compact   fits   in   a   very   small   space   night   light   is   surprisingly   useful   it   lights   the   way   to   the   bathroom   without   being   so   bright   as   to   be   distracting   cons   power   cord   length   is   not   adjustable   included   mounting   screws   anchors   are   flimsy   i   bought   this   andis   dryer   to   replace   a   similar   type   conair   unit   that   died   after   about   a   year   s   use .   my   wife   s   habit   of   leaving   her   non   hanging   dryer   and   tangle   of   cords   all   over   the   sink   and   vanity   motivated   me   to   get   a   replacement   fast !   the   dryer   does   its   job   drying   very   well .   the   compact   handset   is   easy   to   maneuver   and   it   puts   out   a   surprisingly   high   volume   of   air   at   the   right   temperature ,   which   is   a   must   for   those   with   long   or   extra   thick   hair .   this   is   the   smallest   unit   of   its   kind   i   ve   seen .   the   mounting   bracket   is   barely   wider   than   the   dryer ,   which   makes   putting   it   into   tight   places   a   snap .   the   relatively   minor   disadvantages   have   to   do   with   the   installation .   first ,   the   power   cord   length   cannot   be   adjusted .   it   is   one   continuous   cord   from   the   bottom   of   handset ,   through   the   mounting   bracket ,   and   down   to   the   gfci   power   plug .   some   competing   dryers   have   an   electrical   junction   in   the   bracket   which   allows   you   to   shorten   the   wire   running   from   the   bracket   to   the   wall   outlet   and   makes   for   a   neater ,   tangle   free   installation .   second ,   and   this   is   a   quibble ,   the   enclosed   mounting   screws   and   wall   anchors   are   pretty   flimsy .   i   substituted   a   better   pair   i   had   sitting   around   in   my   toolbox .   all   in   all ,   this   product   does   what   it   is   supposed   to   very   well   and ,   despite   a   couple   of   one   time   installation   issues ,   i   am   very   pleased   with   my   purchase .
don   t   know   what   an   ion   dryer   is ,   but   i   love   it !   i   ve   read   the   reviews   and   have   to   admit   i   really   don   t   understand   the   ion   thing   but   whatever   it   is ,   it   sure   seems   to   be   working .   my   old   dryer   conked   out   so   i   decided   to   purchase   this   one .   with   my   hair   looking   quite   damaged   recently   i   wanted   a   dryer   that   wouldn   t   make   it   worse .   i   changed   shampoo   at   the   same   time   so   i   m   not   sure   which   did   it ,   but   my   hair   looks   so   much   healthier .   i   have   fine ,   straight   hair   and   lots   of   it   and   i   m   still   finished   drying   in   5   6   minutes .   much   faster   than   before   without   the   static   and   damage .   love   the   setting   controls   i   use   the   warm ,   high   setting   and   it   leaves   my   hair   really   soft   and   healthy   looking   with   no   frizz .   that   alone   is   worth   the   modest   investment   in   this   product .   i   haven   t   used   the   attachments   and   don   t   think   i   will   need   to   a   nice   bonus   but   not   something   i   require .   i   saw   reports   of   sparks   and   singed   hair   and   will   be   on   the   lookout   for   those   things ,   but   so   far   i   m   extremely   pleased   and   may   order   a   second   one   for   my   daughter .   kudos   revlon !

broke   after   a   year   i   really   liked   the   ionic   technology .   it   dries   hair   a   lot   faster .   however ,   after   a   year   of   owning   this ,   it   broke .   i   had   to   buy   another   dryer   from   amazon ,   and   i   chose   a   different   one   the   conair   213x   infiniti   professional   tourmaline   dryer .   i   noticed   that   the   sound   on   the   conair   when   on   high   setting   was   a   lot   quieter   than   the   andis .   i   get   the   impression   that   the   motor   on   the   conair   is   of   a   higher   quality   than   that   of   the   andis .
great   dryer ! !   i   love   this   dryer .   it   has   improved   the   texture   and   whole   condition   of   my   hair .   my   african   american   hair   is   less   frizzy ,   smoother   and   calmer .   i   m   buying   two   more   for   my   sisters   as   christmas   presents .
good   value ,   excelent   results ! ! ! !   i   try   for   the   first   time   ionic   hair   dryer   and   i   have   to   say ,   it   works .   the   andis   tourmaline   hair   dryer   is   better   than   i   thought .   makes   my   hair   feel   much   much   softer ,   the   blowing   is   strong   and   faster   than   normal   hair   dryers   do .   so   ,   trust   it ! ! ! !   worth   it .
great   hair   dryer   this   is   my   2nd   conair   hair   dryer   with   the   cord   keeper   in   the   past   5   or   so   years   and   i   have   been   very   pleased   with   both   of   them .   i   had   the   smaller   model   with   the   fold   up   handle   first   which   traveled   with   me   and   was   used   almost   daily   at   home   until   something   went   wrong   with   the   plug .   this   one   is   heavier   but   i   like   the   way   you   can   adjust   the   heat   and   the   speed   settings ,   rather   than   just   high   low   off .   i   love   the   internal   cord   keeper   would   hate   to   ever   go   back   to   one   without   that   feature !
lots   of   power   for   a   compact   hair   dryer !   i   bought   2   more   ,   1   to   replace   the   bathrooms   that   was   used   by   4   girls   constantly ! !   and   the   other   for   our   friends   that   loved   the   convience .   for   around   18   bucks   these   powerful   dryers   are   tough .   the   one   that   died   needed   to   be   replaced   after   almost   2   years   of   hard   work .   remember   there   not   just   practicle   but   safer   with   kids !   and   the   dim   night   light   is   a   bonus .   i   am   now   thinking   about   selling   these   on   the   street   .   just   kidding   trust   me   when   i   say   you   will   enjoy !   banb
unauthorized   seller   as   far   as   the   product   goes ,   it   is   a   fantastic   hair   dryer .   it   leaves   my   hair   feeling   soft   and   looking   silky   after   blow   drying   it   before   i   even   do   anything   else   to   my   hair .   however ,   my   gripe   with   this   product   is   that   amazon   is   not   an   authorized   seller   of   the   product   and ,   thus ,   i   cannot   register   the   hair   dryer .   t3   actually   told   me   i   should   send   it   back   to   amazon   and   refuse   the   credit   card   charges   with   my   credit   card   company .   fortunately   for   amazon ,   and   unfortunately   for   me ,   i   don   t   have   the   time   or   money   to   spend   trying   to   resolve   this   issue .   i   just   pray   that   my   investment   in   this   hair   dryer ,   which   i   hope   is   authentic ,   will   not   be   short   lived .   let   the   buyer   of   this   hair   dryer   from   amazon   beware !
great   value !   excellent   hair   dryer   for   the   money !   drying   time   is   cut   by   half ,   great   tools   included .   my   only   wish   is   that   it   didn   t   weigh   so   much .   it   is   a   bit   heavy   but   on   the   upside ,   by   biceps   are   more   sculpted   now .   so ... you   can   save   about   200   dollars   for   this   model   and   have   a   heavier   dryer   or   purchase   a   t3   which   performs   the   same   but   is   wayyy   lighter .   br   br   decisions ... decisions ...  
great   hairdryer !   i   ll   be   honest ,   the   only   hairdryer   i   ve   consistently   used   other   than   borrowing   friend   s   and   such   is   my   mom   s   crazy   20   year   old   one .   and   i   was   looking   to   get   a   hairdryer   for   college ,   especially   since   i   didn   t   want   to   be   caught   out   in   the   cold   with   wet   hair   with   the   temperatures   dropping .   so   i   researched   a   little ,   saw   that   this   one   got   pretty   good   reviews ,   and   bought   it .   it   s   a   decent   price ,   not   too   heavy ,   and   after   less   than   10   minutes ,   my   thick ,   below   the   shoulder ,   layered   hair   was   completely   dry .   and   it   looked   like   i   d   just   come   back   from   getting   my   hair   done .   amazing .   my   hair   feels   soft   and   silky .   i   had   no   problems   with   accidentally   turning   the   switches   on   or   off   honestly   i   don   t   see   how   you   could   unless   your   fingers   wrap   all   the   way   around   the   handle   ,   my   arm   didn   t   get   tired   you   re   only   holding   it   for   less   than   ten   minutes ,   when   does   it   have   time   to   get   tired   !   ,   and   air   stream   is   pretty   strong .   my   only   problem   is   that   my   hair   looked   a   little   dry ,   and   the   dryer   didn   t   look   that   professional ,   but   those   are   minor   issues .   overall ,   i   m   a   fan .
excellant   product !   i   have   owned   one   of   these   for   over   5   years   and   couldn   t   be   more   satisfied .   i   originally   paid   40.00   and   thought   that   was   a   high   price ,   but   after   years   of   faultless   performance ,   i   d   pay   that   price   again .   i   m   glad   i   don   t   have   to   because   now   the   price   has   really   come   down .   this   small   hairdryer   has   more   air   force   than   all   the   big   clunky   ones   i   ve   used   in   the   past .   the   telephone   type   cord   is   rugged   and   will   stretch   as   far   as   10   feet .   excellant   product   in   every   category .
andis   1600w   quiet   hangup   hair   dryer   with   night   light   i   bought   this   wall   mounted   dryer   to   free   up   some   space   in   the   kids   bathroom ,   and   it   works   great .   the   nightlight   is   nice   and   bright   and   the   dryer   isn   t   too   loud .   the   bracket   mounted   easily   once   i   pounded   the   raised   ground   screw   terminal   flat .   the   bracket   won   t   lay   flat   against   the   wall   with   the   raised   ground   screw   terminal   on   the   bracket .   the   cord   hook   on   the   dryer   mounted   easily   and   works   wonderfully .   i   ve   only   had   it   a   couple   of   weeks ,   but   everyone   in   the   family   really   likes   it .

double   duty   hair   dryer   baby   soother !   i   have   owned   this   hair   dryer   since   2000 ,   and   i   have   enjoyed   it   thoroughly .   this   blowdryer   is   super   quiet .   i   did   not   notice   that   it   took   any   longer   to   dry   my   hair   with   this   dryer   versus   my   older   1875   watt   dryer .   i   bought   it   primarily   because   it   advertised   the   quiet   motor .   it   is   somewhat   heavy ,   but   once   you   get   used   to   it ,   it   is   no   big   deal .   i   dropped   this   dryer   probably   a   couple   hundred   times   and   it   continued   to   work   just   fine .   recently   i   noticed   it   was   only   blowing   cold   air   and   assumed   that   the   heating   element   went   out .   i   was   going   to   throw   it   in   the   trash .   lucky   for   me ,   i   didn   t   get   around   to   it .   it   is   the   perfect   sleep   soother   for   my   now   8   month   old   daughter .   it   was   just   loud   enough   to   break   her   crying   spree   and   get   her   focused   on   sleep ,   plus ,   since   the   heating   element   went   out ,   we   don   t   have   to   worry   about   her   us   accidently   touching   a   hot   dryer .   it   is   amazing ,   we   turn   it   on   and   she   immediately   plops   her   head   down   on   my   chest   and   is   out   like   a   light   in   just   a   couple   of   minutes ! !   wonderful ,   amazing   on   those   rough   days   when   nothing   else   seems   to   work .   i   enjoyed   this   hair   dryer   so   much   that   i   have   just   purchased   two   more .   a   back   up   for   my   daughter   s   restless   episodes   and   one   just   for   me !
ok   hair   dryer ,   but   has   several   design   flaws   i   ve   had   this   hair   dryer   for   about   6   months   now   and   i   m   not   all   that   impressed   with   it .   it   s   performance   is   decent   dries   hair   quickly   with   less   frizz   ,   but   it   s   design   and   construction   leave   something   to   be   desired .   issues   1   it   s   really   heavy   so   be   prepared   for   your   arm   to   get   a   work   out   when   using   it .   2   the   placement   of   the   cord   retractor   button   is   really   bad .   if   you   set   the   dryer   down   on   it   s   side   sometimes   the   retractor   button   will   get   bumped   causing   your   dryer   to   slide   across   the   counter .   3   about   1   month   ago   the   on   off   button   popped   off .   i   was   able   to   stick   it   back   on ,   but   it   will   occasionally   still   fall   off   during   use .   4   the   cord   retractor   is   somewhat   dangerous   and   also   will   get   stuck   occasionally   during   cord   retraction .   5   the   placement   of   the   cool   shot   requires   you   to   hold   the   dryer   awkwardly   to   keep   from   accidentally   pressing   it .   maybe   it   s   just   a   matter   of   preference   in   design ,   but   this   dryer   has   been   very   awkward   and   difficult   for   me   to   use .   i   just   don   t   think   that   the   performance   is   good   enough   to   put   up   with   all   of   the   negatives .   i   will   probably   shell   out   a   little   more   money   the   next   time   i   purchase   a   hair   dryer   and   get   something   better .
andis   82075   hair   dryer   this   is   the   first   time   i   ve   purchased   a   hair   dryer   on   line .   it   seems   that   i   ve   had   to   replace   my   store   purchased   dryers   annually   if   not   sooner   in   the   past .   i   m   hoping   this   one   is   better   built   than   the   others   i   ve   owned   previously .   it   does   seem   to   be   a   higher   quality   product .   i   have   to   confess   that   the   color   of   this   hair   dryer   was   what   initially   caught   my   eye .   it   s   a   powerful   dryer .... certainly   has   shorten   my   hair   drying   time .   i   like   this   product   a   lot   with   one   exception   the   position   of   the   buttons .   they   are   situated   at   the   middle   of   the   handle .   i   end   up   accidentally   shutting   off   the   dryer   constantly   in   the   midst   of   drying   my   hair !   not   a   big   deal   just   sort   of   irritating .   had   they   moved   the   buttons   higher   up   on   the   handle ,   this   problem   could   have   been   eliminated .   perhaps   they   ll   make   that   adjustment   on   the   next   model .   nonetheless ,   i   think   this   product   earns   a   4   star !
hair   dryer   this   dryer   was   purchased   to   replace   a   like   dryer .   i   was   extremely   disappointed   to   find   this   product   had   no   night   light .
awesome   product ! !   i   had   seen   this   dryer   reviewed   in   instyle   for   a   couple   of   months   and   had   considered   purchasing   it .   i   have   very   natural   curly   hair .   the   reviews   said   this   product   was   helpful   in   taking   the   curl   out .   after   trying   other   products   i   decided   to   try   this .   i   was   pleasently   surprised .   i   have   alot   less   frizz   than   before .   even   thought   the   power   is   not   tremendous   that   is   not   a   problem .   the   dryer   gets   very   hot   and   really   straightens   my   hair .   i   really   like   that   it   is   light   weight   also .
good   dryer   for   the   price   this   dryer   does   dry   may   hair   fast   and   it   seems   less   frizzy   than   with   other   dryers .   i   have   had   many   dryers   ranging   from   cheap   to   very   expensive .   this   one   ranks   in   the   top   percent .   a   few   downsides ... it   s   a   bit   heavy   and   i   don   t   like   where   the   buttons   are   located   on   off   warm   hot   i   m   constantly   turning   the   dryer   on   warm   when   i   want   it   hot .   not   the   end   of   the   world ,   just   something   i   would   change   about   it   if   i   could .
don   t   buy   this   hair   dryer   unfortunately ,   like   other   reviewers   here ,   my   conair   1875   watt   ionic   cord   keeper   died   after   a   few   months   of   use .   while   it   was   working   it   was   excellent .   but   i   don   t   expect   a   hair   dryer   to   die   after   just   a   few   months .   buy   something   else !
cute   hair   dryer   this   is   a   cute   hair   dryer   and   my   2   year   old   daughter   loves   it   because   it   s   pink   and   has   a   kitty   on   it .   would   be   nice   if   it   had   a   cooler   setting   on   it .   my   daughter   cries   sometimes   because   it   s   too   hot .   all   in   all ,   a   good   buy   because   the   gimmick   of   a   pink   hair   dryer   got   her   to   dry   her   hair   with   it   when   she   wouldn   t   let   me   dry   it   with   my   hair   dryer .
jerdon   1600w   is   great !   i   bought   this   product   about   6   7   years   ago   at   a   local   store   and   loved   it .   when   it   wore   out   i   was   so   happy   to   find   amazon   had   the   identical   item .   i   couldn   t   believe   how   fast   it   arrived   and   it   works   just   as   good   as   the   first   one .   i   really   like   having   the   wall   mount   design   and   it   s   simple   to   use .   a   great   price   for   a   wonderful   product !
what   junk   i   m   amazed   that   people   described   this   product   as   heavy .   i   find   it   incredibly   light   weight   and   cheap .   i   wasn   t   expecting   much   for   the   price ,   but   even   at   the   friday   sale   price   this   feels   overpriced .   i   d   be   stunned   if   it   held   up   any   time   at   all .
great   item   perfect   for   space   saving   in   your   bathroom   i   have   always   loved   using   these   great   hair   dryers   at   hotels   and   thought   it   would   be   great   to   have   one   att   home ,   and   it   is .   no   more   messes   on   the   counter   or   sink ,   and   you   never   have   to   wonder   which   drawer   it   is   in ...
good   dryer   it   s   very   good .   it   has   two   levels   viz   low   and   high .   i   wish   if   there   was   a   medium   level .   works   on   both   110   and   220   volts   ac .
economical   effective !   i   ve   been   using   this   dryer   regularly   for   8   months   now   and   it   is   a   great   deal   for   the   money .   the   retractable   cord   and   folding   handle   work   fine .   this   is   my   first   ionic   ceramic   hair   dryer   and   i   am   not   at   all   disappointed   with   this   purchase !
great   product ,   performs   as   advertised   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   for   college   since   it   was   a   little   smaller   than   the   others   and   it   works   great !   not   too   loud ... not   very   soft   either ... two   settings   for   heat ... just   a   normal ,   everyday   dryer   that   operates   when   i   need   it   to .
hairdryer   with   light   i   bought   this   item   and   when   it   received   the   box   was   in   bad   shape ,   the   dryer   work ,   but   the   light   didn   t .   i   sent   it   back   in   the   same   box   it   was   received   and   they   returned   one   that   didn   t   even   run .   i   would   not   reccommend   this   iten   to   anyone .   i   bought   the   same   one   from   target   and   it   works   gread .   i   would   recommend   you   not   to   order   it   from   amazon .
hair   dryer   i   love   the   jerdon   1600w   wall   hair   dryer .   this   is   the   second   one   that   i   have   and   it   works   great .
just   like   the   hotel !   we   were   traveling   and   in   one   hotel   my   husband   commented   this   wall   mount   hair   dryer   is   great !   next   morning   i   ordered   one   from   amazon .   it   arrived   3   days   later   and   he   is   a   happy   man !
compact   easy   i   have   used   a   wall   mounted   hair   blower   for   over   20   years ,   the   first   being   one   made   by   sears   then   an   oster   i   still   use   this   one .   the   sears   is   no   longer   made   and   the   oster   has   a   reset   on   the   plug   which   made   it   difficult   to   use   in   this   case .   the   sears   oster   are   better   made   but   look   very   similar   to   the   jerdon .   the   first   one   sent   by   amazon   had   a   defective   button   so   they   immediately   replaced   it .   the   jerdon   is   a   little   noisy ,   the   reset   buttons   on   the   side   of   the   unit   are   hard   to   work   but   the   hairblower   seems   to   be   working   fine .   i   have   only   had   it   for   3   weeks   so   time   will   tell   if   it   holds   up .
excellent   dual   voltage   hair   dryer !   this   review   is   for   the   t3   overnight   dual   voltage   hair   dryer .   i   have   just   used   it   overseas   and   i   am   thrilled   that   both   the   low   and   high   settings   work   on   the   240v   setting   every   other   dual   voltage   hair   dryer   i   ve   had   in   the   past   only   worked   on   the   low   setting   overseas   .   this   hair   dryer   is   excellent   because   it   is   lightweight   and   dries   my   hair   very   quickly   with   much   less   frizz   than   ordinary   hair   dryers .   i   also   purchased   the   t3   tourmaline   diffuser   and   love   it   because   i   have   naturally   wavy   hair   and   it   leaves   my   hair   with   nice   waves ,   much   less   frizz   and   it   does   not   feel   crunchy   and   dry   at   the   ends   just   nice   soft   waves .   i   can   t   say   that   it   leaves   my   hair   completely   frizz   free   but   definitely   softer .   i   would   highly   recommend   this   hair   dryer .
i   love   it ! ! ! !   i   have   thick   african   american   hair .   this   straightens   my   hair   quickly   and   i   don   t   need   to   work   so   hard   when   flat   ironing   my   air   with   this .   br   br   i   also   suggest   buying   a   nice   ionic   hairbrush   like   the   conair   and   if   you   use   flat   irons ,   you   can   find   a   really   good   ionic   brand   without   spending   chi   money .   i   have   the   titanium   tools   jilbere   de   paris   flat   iron ....   whatever   it   is ...   works   for   me   and   cost   me   around   50 .   half   the   chi   price .   get   the   biosilk   or   the   chi   silk   infusion   use   a   small   amount   to   protect   your   hair ...   they   last   a   long   time   and   protect   your   hair .   br   br   you   will   rarely   need   a   salon   with   these   ingredients .
perfect !   i   was   skeptical   about   the   ceramic   disk   ion   feature ,   that   it   would   actually   reduce   the   static   electricity ,   fly   aways   frizzies   and   make   my   hair   shinier   and   more   manageable .   how   could   a   thing   that   blows   air   do   all   that   i   knew   i   needed   to   look   for   something   new   though   because   after   using   my   old   blow   dryer ,   my   medium   thick ,   wavy ,   frizzy   fly   away   hair   was   not   presenting   itself   in   a   pretty   way   but   just   looking   worse   and   worse .   any   grade   of   shampoo   and   conditioner   didn   t   seem   to   make   a   big   difference   overall .   it   got   to   be   where   i   just   dreaded   the   task   of   doing   my   hair .   after   using   this   conair   dryer   one   time ,   my   crown   of   glory   was   good   enough   to   go   as   is   if   i   didn   t   have   time   to   use   the   flat   iron .   this   is   a   100   improvement   over   my   old   no   special   features   blow   dryer   which   has   been   retired   to   probably   dry   pets   and   mittens   and   boots   or   whatever .   now   after   using   this   conair   almost   daily   for   about   a   month ,   i   wish   i   had   learned   about   the   technology   way   sooner   and   saved   myself   a   lot   of   angst   over   how   to   tame   my   hair .   i   love   this   blow   dryer   and   that   it   came   with   three   attachments   i   don   t   know   which   i   like   best   ,   that   it   is   light   weight ,   has   a   sufficient   length   cord ,   dries   my   hair   quickly ,   isn   t   overly   loud ,   and   most   of   all   that   i   can   see   that   my   hair   is   in   better   condition .
bespoke   labs   featherweight   dryer   is   superior   this   dryer   is   most   definetely   worth   the   money .   i   have   naturaly   curly   frizzy   hair .   this   dryer   gives   me   soft ,   smooth   hair   in   less   time .   the   dryer   is   less   weight   and   less   noisy   than   all   of   the   others   i   have   tried .   this   dryer   is   the   best ! !
not   too   crazy   about   it   it   s   a   pretty   average   product .   my   issues   with   it   heavy   weight   positioning   of   on   off   switch   is   really   awkward ,   you   cant   use   your   index   finger   the   diffuser   and   concentrator   are   too   long ,   with   them   on   the   entire   construction   is   just   way   too   big   if   you   re   used   to   compact   hair   dryers   keep   looking ,   this   is   not   it .   having   said   that   it   still   does   what   it   s   supposed   to   do   dries   hair ,   and   it   s   on   the   less   expensive   side   of   the   range .
not   authorized   you   ll   be   taking   a   chance   i   bought   this   dryer   at   amazon   in   order   to   get   it   for   125   less   than   the   msr .   in   6   months   it   quit   working   completely   and   i   contacted   amazon   about   it   only   to   be   told   that   it   was   past   the   30   days .   i   emailed   amazon   a   few   time   before   posting   this ,   in   order   to   give   then   a   chance   to   make   it   right ,   but   they   offer   no   help   at   all .   this   is   when   i   learned   that   these   hair   dryers   are   only   sold   through   authorized   dealers   and   amazon   is   not   one   of   them .   so   my   hair   dryer   is   possibly   a   copy   it   is   certainly   not   under   any   kind   of   warranty   and   i   just   lost   that   175 .   the   real   deal   is   a   fabulous   dryer   and   i   would   suggest   buying   it   for   the   full   300   and   having   a   4   year   warranty   on   it .   amazon   is   one   of   the   places   online   that   i   have   always   felt   safe   making   purchases ,   but   no   more .   please   be   aware   that   you   re   taking   a   chance   that   it   may   not   be   authentic   and   it   might   fail ,   and ,   if   it   does ,   you   will   have   just   lost   a   lot   of   money   because   there   is   no   support   for   it .
my   take   i   would   say   it   s   a   three   pont   five   instead   of   a   three .   as   long   as   you   sit   in   the   right   chair   and   use   the   right   table ,   it   s   not   too   bad ,   and   have   plenty   to   do .   i   got   this   to   free   my   hands   for   other   things   sometimes ,   and   i   m   going   to   use   it   more   now   that   it   s   recommended   over   hand   held   dryers   because   it   s   less   damaging   to   hair .   i   just   have   my   hair   down   instead   of   rollers   for   faster   drying ,   but   going   to   start   wrapping   my   hair   so   it   won   t   be   as   frizzy .   it   takes   about   an   hour   to   dry   my   hair .   i   m   sure   it   would   be   about   the   same   if   i   used   an   1875   wattage   one .   i   would   recommend   it   if   you   have   the   patience   to   sit   under   a   dryer   and   have   things   to   occupy   your   time   with .
not   up   to   conair   s   quality   i   bought   this   product   dec   8 , 2006 ,   and   it   lasted   till   aug   20 ,   2007 .   it   s   not   worth   the   cost   to   ship   back .   it   just   stopped   working .   my   last   conair   hair   dryer   lasted   some   15   or   more   years .   think   i   ll   check   out   some   other   brands   by   checking   out   these   great   reviews   on   amazon .   don   t   buy   this   hair   dryer ,   you   will   be   greatly   disappointed .
fast   styling ,   low   noise   nice   shine   i   highly   recommend   this   hair   dryer .   i   have   very   thick   hair   with   slight   wave ,   and   for   years   i   d   let   it   air   dry   just   to   avoid   the   excessive   blowdrying   time   required   and   damage   that   ensued .   my   mother   in   law   has   this   model   at   her   summer   cottage ,   so   i   d   use   it   when   we   were   there .   typically ,   one   doesn   t   put   as   much   effort   into   vacation   hairstyling ,   but   despite   that ,   my   hair   always   turned   out   better   while   away   than   when   at   home .   though   it   s   quiet   to   the   point   that   i   hadn   t   expected   much   power   from   it ,   i   was   pleasantly   surprised   to   find   it   very   efficient .   it   dries   very   fast ,   doesn   t   scorch   your   head ,   and   adds   a   healthy   shine ,   too .   i   m   replacing   my   current   hair   dryer   with   this   model .   i   was   hoping   to   make   a   trade   with   my   mother   in   law ,   but   she   won   t   give   it   up !
everything   you   can   expect   from   a   hair   dryer   i   already   own   3   different   hair   dryers   from   this   brand .   love   them   and   will   never   go   for   anything   less   than   that   quality .
great   product   i   was   looking   for   a   new   hair   dryer   b   c   mine   did   not   have   the   concetrator   attachment   and   the   universal   wouldn   t   fit .   so   i   found   this   one   and   it   had   a   great   price   and   had   pretty   good   reviews   on   other   websites   but   a   great   price   here .   i   got   a   great   deal   with   the   flat   iron   as   well .   it   s   perfect .   it   drys   my   hair   much   quicker   and   my   hair   feels   softer   and   looks   better   than   it   did   with   just   the   regular   hair   dryer .   i   would   absolutely   recommend   this   item .
worst   quality   product   ever !   i   ve   had   two .   first   one   quit   working   in   2   months .   replacement   also   quit   working   after   3   months .   i   still   haven   t   gotten   all   the   gory   details   on   where   to   send   this   second   defective   unit .   plus ,   i   have   to   pay   to   ship   it   there   and   include   a   check   for   14.95   for   processing .   some   warranty .   it   may   be   4   years ,   but   is   it   worth   the   hassle   time   expense   of   returning   every   3   4   months   the   worst   part   is   that   the   first   one   was   a   gift   from   my   sister   in   law   and   she   was   mortified   so   handled   the   first   replacement ... the   store   kindly   exchanged   it   for   her .   she   paid   200   for   the   darn   thing ,   so   i   would   hope   so !   in   any   case ,   i   did   not   want   to   prevail   upon   her   kindness   again ,   so   decided   to   handle   this   one   myself .   i   go   to   the   web   site   no   info   there   says   to   call   them .   i   call   them .   they   tell   me   to   go   to   the   website   and   send   an   email .   huh   why   couldn   t   they   have   just   said   that   on   the   website   i   suspect   because   they   have   a   lot   of   defective   units   but   don   t   want   people   to   guess   that ,   and   if   they   had   the   warranty   info   there ,   well ,   it   would   be   a   negative   and   not   a   positive .   at   any   case ,   and   at   that   kind   of   money ,   there   should   be   better   quality   control   and   warranty   instructions !   so   that   i   don   t   have   to   go   thru   this   every   3   months !   what   is   wrong   with   this   picture   yes ,   buy   it   if   you   want   to   deal   with   the   warranty   mess   and   inconvenience   and   cost .   you   ll   love   it   for   the   3   months ,   miss   it   for   2   months   while   awaiting   the   warranty   info   replacement ... and   then   the   cycle   will   begin   again .   i   have   very   thick   hair   with   waves   and   it   works   wonders   and   leaves   my   hair   shiny .   but ,   geesh ,   i   could   never   recommend   it   to   anyone .   200   and   i   have   to   send   it   back   for   warranty   every   2   3   months .   hello   bespoke   are   you   listening   my   friends   would   never   forgive   me   if   i   recommended   such   a   poor   quality   product   to   them .   now   that   i   had   to   prevail   upon   my   sister   in   law   to   get   her   receipt ,   and   i   have   it   in   hand ,   i   can   now   spend   my   money   to   send   the   thing   back .   this   has   added   3   weeks   to   the   delay ,   but   i   have   four   years .   at   this   rate ,   they   will   probably   wait   until   just   about   the   end   of   that   period   to   send   me   a   replacement   so   the   new   one   will   be   out   of   warranty   practically   when   it   arrives .   i   got   the   first   one   in   late   dec   2006 .   the   second   one   in   mid   marchlay ,   but   i   have   four   years .   at   this   rate ,   they   will   probably   wait   until   just   about   the   end   of   that   period   to   send   me   a   replacement   so   the   new   one   will   be   out   of   warranty   practically   when   it   arrives .   i   got   the   first   one   in   late   dec   2006 .   the   second   one   in   mid   march
excellent   deal   this   hair   dryer   was   recommended   to   me   by   a   coworker   after   i   commented   on   how   nice   her   hair   looks .   sturdy   construction ,   retractable   cord ,   great   price ,   and   my   hair   looks   much   better   with   this   blow   dryer   than   others   in   the   same   price   range .
watch   that   cord !   the   dryer   worked   great .   heavier   than   i   m   used   to .   i   followed   the   directions   when   retracting   the   cord   the   first   time   to   hold   the   plug   end   in   one   hand   and   push   the   retraction   button   with   the   other   ,   but   the   button   wouldn   t   press   down   easily ,   so   i   let   go   of   the   plug   end   to   use   2   fingers   to   press   the   button   and   cautiously   turned   my   head   away   just   in   case   .   but   the   plug   end   whipped   around   and   clobbered   me   in   the   face   anyways ,   so   watch   that   feature .
great   for   kids ,   except ........   this   dryer   was   easy   to   install .   i   like   the   size   and   style   it   looks   great   in   my   kid   s   bathroom .   i   would   give   it   5   stars   if   it   weren   t   so   loud ,   my   kid   s   are   startled   each   time   i   turn   on   the   dryer   even   with   previous   warning   .   it   does   dry   their   hair   quickly ,   so   it   definetly   does   the   job !
bouncy ,   shiny   blowouts   i   was   actually   giddy   the   first   time   i   used   this   because   of   how   it   made   my   hair   so   smooth   and   full   of   body .   this   baby   plus   a   little   mousse   work   wonders .   my   hair   is   fine   and   not   extremely   thick ,   and   this   dryer   does   a   great   job   of   giving   me   extra   volume   when   i   want   a   more   glamourous   look .   i   feel   it   was   worth   the   splurge ,   although   i   m   glad   i   bought   it   when   i   did   a   few   months   ago   because   the   price   has   since   gone   up   on   it .
t3   tourmaline   83808   hair   dryer   was   very   skeptical   about   buying   a   hair   dyer   that   is   expensive   but   it   does   do   the   job   more   quickly   than   the   lower   priced   hair   dryers .   it   is   also   lightweight   and   does   not   dry   your   hair   out .
powerful   portable   small   and   powerful .   it   dries   my   hair   as   fast   as   my   full   sized   dryer   and   doesn   t   take   up   nearly   as   much   space .   also ,   my   hair   which   is   prone   to   fuzziness   when   blown   dry   doesn   t   come   out   fuzzy .
junk !   it   died   after   a   year   of   moderate   use .   it   was   not   quiet   and   not   fast .   the   supposed   ionic   function   is   a   bunch   of   hooey .   fine ,   for   the   price   i   could   just   say ,   whatever .   the   ion   thing   was   just   a   sales   gimmick   i   fell   for .   unfortunately ,   after   a   year   of   moderate   use   it   suddenly   developed   a   stench   and   then   died   in   about   30   seconds .   no ,   it   wasn   t   clogged   with   hair   or   anything   like   that .
conventient ,   good   power   tacks   onto   the   wall   very   nicely .   it   comes   with   double   sided   thick   tape   and   places   for   screws .   i   used   the   tape   and   haven   t   had   any   problems   in   over   month .   i   saw   these   in   hotels   all   the   time   and   loved   the   convenience .   now   i   don   t   have   to   deal   with   dragging   it   out   of   the   closet   every   morning .   it   s   right   there   hanging   next   to   the   mirror .   i   found   it   to   be   plenty   powerful ,   and   not   too   hot .   the   lower   setting   is   good   if   you   don   t   want   to   disturb   someone   who   is   sleeping .   the   high   setting   is   powerful   and   loud .
great   the   product   was   exactly   as   described   and   works   great .   we   placed   it   in   our   guest   bath   and   not   only   do   they   have   a   hair   dryer ,   but   a   night   light   as   well .   thanks .
conair   i   really   like   the   conair   hair   dryer .   it   doesn   t   limit   my   movements   when   i   have   the   bonnet   on .   i   can   do   other   things   like   read ,   or   use   my   computer   because   the   heat   isn   t   coming   down   on   my   neck   and   my   ears .   i   do   with   that   the   bonnet   was   larger   though ,   because   i   use   big   rollers   and   it   is   a   hassle   putting   on   the   bonnet .
almost   perfect   searched   for   this   dryer   after   trying   it   in   a   hotel   and   loving   how   great   my   hair   looked .   still   happy   with   the   way   it   dries   my   hair ,   but   have   found   the   same   problem   others   have   with   the   retractable   cord .   it   worked   great   for   a   month   and   now   will   not   retract .   a   bit   of   a   nuisance   that   spoils   overall   satisfaction ,   but   still   worth   buying .
watch   the   retractable   cord ! ! !   i   would   have   given   this   a   better   rating ,   because   the   dryer   performs   just   fine .   i   especially   like   the   variable   speeds   and   heat   settings .   caution   be   careful   when   pushing   the   cord   retraction   button   as   it   will   fly   wildly   about   causing   a   risk   of   getting   socked   in   the   face   with   the   oversized   safey   plug .
bespoke   labs   t3   se   ionic   hair   dryer   i   was   unable   to   keep   this   product   due   to   the   fact   that   the   products   box   was   not   sealed   and   there   was   not   a   serial   code   attached   to   the   hair   dryer .   this   code   is   necessary   in   order   to   register   it   for   it   s   5   yr   warranty .   when   i   informed   amazon   of   this   problem ,   they   sent   me   another   one ,   and   this   too   did   not   have   a   seal   and   bar   code .   this   only   leads   me   to   wonder   where   are   these   dryers   coming   from  
bonnett   hair   dryer   a   bit   old   fashioned ,   but   i   ve   had   one   around   for   years !   they   work   for   me !
pretty   lame   i   don   t   know   if   my   product   is   defective ,   i   just   got   it   in   the   mail .   but   it   is   not   what   i   would   call   a   hair   dryer .   it   doesn   t   generate   much   of   a   wind   and   it   doesn   t   get   very   warm .   i   would   not   even   consider   this   something   worthy   of   packing   to   go   on   a   trip .   i   m   going   to   send   it   back   and   keep   my   nice   hair   dryer   which   is   just   a   little   bit   bigger .
it   burned   out   in   6   months   i   bought   it   in   the   middle   of   december   2006 .   today   june   18 ,   2007 ,   i   turned   it   on   to   use   it   and   it   burned   out   and   smoke   was   coming   from   the   vents .   the   plastic   around   the   slot   the   tube   goes   into   broke   twice .. had   no   choice   but   to   stitch   it   with   thread   to   keep   it   attached   to   the   plastic   cap .   so   disappointed   with   this   product .   don   t   buy   it .   better   to   spend   the   money   and   buy   professional .   this   product   is   not   worth   the   40something   dollars   i   paid   for   it .
best   hair   dryer   ever   i   have   fine ,   wavy ,   fly   away   hair   that   is   prone   to   bushing   and   frizzing   even   in   non   humid   weather   and   until   i   found   this   dryer   nothing   could   smooth ,   straighten   and   calm   down   this   wild   animal   on   my   head !   this   dryer   is   like   a   miracle !   even   in   hot ,   humid   weather   i   can   walk   outside   and   not   feel   my   hair   shrivel   and   kink   up .   ok ,   there   will   be   a   little   frizz ,   but   not   anywhere   near   as   much   as   before .   i   m   telling   you ,   if   this   dryer   can   work   this   well   on   my   hair   it   can   work   for   anyone .   i   ve   tried   other   expensive   dryers   that   women   rave   about   and   they   were   all   a   waste   of   money   compared   to   this   one .   first   of   all ,   let   me   warn   you   that   if   you   are   expecting   this   dryer   to   be   anything   like   your   old   dryer   you   are   going   to   be   let   down .   in   just   about   every   way   this   dryer   makes   you   think   it   s   not   up   to   the   task   but   if   you   give   it   a   chance   you   ll   see   that   it   is   light   years   better   than   anything   else   out   there .   for   instance ,   this   dryer   does   not   seem   to   put   out   a   lot   of   air .   people   tend   to   think   it   doesn   t   have   enough   power   but   that   s   not   because   it   isn   t   working ,   it   s   because   it   doesn   t   need   to   blow   your   hair   to   smithereens   in   order   to   dry   it   quickly   and   thoroughly .   and   the   benefits   from   not   having   to   deal   with   all   that   wind   are   amazing .   it   actually   gives   you   better   control   over   your   hairstyle   and   doesn   t   poof   up   your   hair .   if   you   curl   your   hair   around   a   barrel   brush   and   pull   it   tight ,   then   pull   verrry   slowly   down   to   the   ends   while   following   it   with   the   dryer ,   it   will   dry   your   hair   far   more   efficiently   and   smoothly   than   if   you   had   to   deal   with   tons   of   wind   blowing   your   hair   all   over   the   place .   the   only   thing   is   that   it   takes   some   getting   used   to   the   lack   of   wind   because   you   are   forced   to   handle   your   hair   differently .   once   you   get   the   knack   of   it ,   though ,   you   will   never   want   to   go   back   to   your   old   dryer   again .   i   feel   so   much   less   stressed   out   using   this   dryer ,   too .   it   s   quieter ,   lighter   and   doesn   t   require   gymnastics   to   achieve   amazing   results .   another   thing   is   thatthe   dryer   is   amazingly   light   it   weighs   just   over   half   a   pound !   again ,   the   control   this   affords   you   in   being   able   to   hold   the   dryer   at   strange   angles   indefinitely   without   feeling   awkward   or   tired   is   amazing .   i   used   to   think   that   only   a   professional   could   dry   the   hair   on   the   back   of   my   head   and   style   it   well ,   but   now   i   can   do   it   myself   to   perfection   with   this   dryer .   this   dryer   is   so   easy   to   use   you   will   have   more   energy   when   you   leave   the   bathroom .   i   ll   swear   it   takes   less   time   to   dry   my   hair ,   although   i   haven   t   estimated   by   how   much .   it   feels   like   it   takes   about   25   less   time   than   my   old   dryer ,   which   was   also   a   professional   ionic   ceramic   dryer .   one   thing   that   is   strange   about   this   dryer   but   not   in   a   bad   way   is   that   at   first   i   thought   i   was   seeing   smoke   rising   from   my   hair   when   i   used   it .   this   alarmed   me   because   i   thought   i   was   damaging   my   hair .   now   i   realize   that   this   is   most   likely   the   humidity   being   blown   out   of   my   via   the   miracle   of   modern   science !   it   has   no   smell   and   it   seems   like   water   vapor .   i   had   seen   this   effect   a   bit   with   my   old   dryer ,   but   it   happens   a   lot   with   this   dryer .   all   i   know   is   that   my   hair   comes   out   silky ,   smooth ,   and   since   i   ve   been   using   it ,   in   much   better   condition   than   before .   i   sometimes   feel   like   i   ve   used   a   relaxer   on   my   hair !   the   only   complaint   i   have   about   this   dryer   is   a   small   one   and   quite   minor   in   the   scheme   of   things .   the   control   buttons   are   in   an   awkward   place   on   the   grip   of   the   handle   and   it   is   easy   to   accidentally   turn   the   dryer   off   or   change   the   speed   or   temperature .   there   are   2   independent   speed   controls   and   3   temperature   controls .   other   than   that ,   i   find   the   lower   speed   virtually   unecessary   because   the   higher   speed   is   versatile   enough   to   use   for   any   purpose .   in   general ,   i   would   highly   recommend   this   dryer   to   anyone   regardless   of   their   hair   issues .   i   often   see   women   with   thick   curly   hair   act   as   if   their   hair   type   is   the   hardest   to   handle   and   if   a   dryer   can   work   on   them   it   can   work   on   anyone .   well ,   they   never   had   fine ,   fly   away ,   kinky ,   curly ,   bushy ,   virtually   weightless   hair   that   will   not   be   tamed   for   love   or   money   like   i   do ,   so   i   often   wonder   just   who   has   it   harder   in   that   department !   but   regardless   of   that ,   i   think   that   anyone   who   wants   silkier ,   smoother ,   straighter   hair   will   be   more   than   happy   with   their   results   with   this   dryer .   personally ,   when   i   have   seen   bad   reviews   of   this   dryer   i   think   it   s   because   the   person   hasn   t   learned   how   to   use   it   yet   and   is   expecting   it   to   act   like   the   average   hair   dryer .   if   you   have   that   reaction   i   would   suggest   taking   some   lessons   in   blow   drying   techniques   because   i   am   pretty   sure   that   will   solve   your   problem .   this   dryer   has   taught   me   so   much   about   how   to   dry   my   hair   successfully   that   i   am   almost   in   debt   to   it   for   an   education   as   well .   now   if   they   can   only   come   out   with   a   model   that   will   shine   shoes   too !   update   may ,   2008   i   have   now   owned   this   blow   dryer   for   about   a   year   and   despite   daily   use   it   s   still   going   strong   with   absolutely   no   issues   whatsoever   and   i   am   still   thrilled   with   its   performance !
essential   for   travel   overseas   if   you   depend   on   a   hair   dryer   to   style ,   and   you   are   going   overseas ,   this   product   is   a   must .   compact ,   rather   powerful ,   and   has   a   dual   voltage   feature .   definitely   well   worth   it ,   and   very   affordable   too .
great   until   it   broke   this   hair   dryer   was   awesome   until   it   broke   after   only   about   a   year   of   use .   still   a   pretty   good   price ,   but   i   won   t   buy   the   same   item   for   fear   that   it   will   break   again .
andis   wall   hangup   hair   dryer   30975   with   nightlight   so   far   this   has   been   working   well ,   it   replaced   a   wall   hangup   dryer   that   i   had   for   15   years .   hopefully   this   will   last   as   long .   i   have   other   andis   hairdryer   products   which   i   have   been   satisfied   with ..
very   light   weight   and   yet   powerful   having   recently   broken   my   wrist   and   also   having   hand   function   issues ,   this   is   the   perfect   dryer   for   me .   i   also   loved   the   price   and   it   is   supposed   to   be   a   high   quality   dryer   that   should   last   for   years .   so   what   else   could   you   want   i   have   never   used   more   than   high   and   never   use   those   cool   shots   or   ionic   type   dryers .   this   fits   my   needs   perfectly .   love   it !
awesome   hair   dryer   i   have   been   using   the   hair   dryer   for   almost   a   month .   it   works   great   and   has   nice   features   like   the   cool   air   blast   and   the   night   light .   to   me ,   it   is   a   lot   quieter   than   my   old   dryer ,   and   mounting   it   on   the   wall   only   took   a   few   minutes .   the   night   light   is   perfect   for   the   size   of   bathroom   it   is   in .   if   the   motor   lasts   longer   than   3   mos .   which   is   all   my   jerdon   dryer   lasted ,   this   is   an   excellent   product ! ! ! !
i   used   it   for   3   weeks   and   it   broke !   i   used   it   for   3   weeks   and   the   motor   made   tons   of   noise   and   then   stopped .   it   did   not   work   well   from   the   beginning   and   the   motor   got   worse   with   each   use .   i   used   it   about   10   times .   i   was   sooo   disappointed .   at   the   price   it   was   not   worth   returning .. i   dumped   it ....   what   a   waste   of   money   .   i   am   so   upset   with   this   conair   product ..   you   get   what   you   pay   for .   the   plus   is   the   bonnet   was   soft ... i   kept   the   bonnet   and   threw   out   the   dryer .
disappointed   this   andis   hair   dryer   is   toooooooo   big .   br   very   difficult   to   handle .   br   not   recommended !
small ,   fast ,   hot ! ! !   the   andis   33805   micro   turbo   1600w   dual   voltage   hair   dryer   is   a   great   little   personal   grooming   appliance .   it   has   two   settings   low   and   high .   i   use   high   almost   exclusively ,   even   though   i   have   fine ,   short ,   grey   hair   because   i   don   t   like   to   dawdle   over   grooming   in   the   morning .   its   dual   voltage   selections   125v   250v   would   come   in   handy   if   travelling   with   an   added   plug   adapter   .   high   produces   a   rapid   stream   of   air   that   quickly   heats   up   and   stays   at   a   steady ,   moderately   high   temperature .   low   is   appropriate   if   you   spend   more   time   styling   with   some   degree   of   heat   producing   a   nice   smooth   and   fuller   result .   however ,   i   m   a   type   a   character   who   wants   the   job   done   pronto ,   so   this   is   my   machine   of   choice .   all   dryers   sound   a   little   loud   right   in   your   own   ear ,   but   a   family   member   says   that   the   andis   is   quieter   than   the   sunbeam   i   recently   replaced .   br   br   i   bought   this   device   to   replace   a   sunbeam   compact   dryer ,   which   replaced   another   sunbeam ,   which   was   preceded   by   at   least   two   conairs ,   and   a   parade   of   various   compact   mostly   dryers   over   the   last   32   years .   this   is   the   best   of   the   lot .   i   actually   gambled   and   bought   two   at   once   because   compact   dryers   are   getting   hard   to   find   now ,   and   my   confidence   has   been   rewarded .   br   br   if   you   are   looking   for   a   quick   solution   to   get   going   in   the   morning   after   your   shower ,   look   no   further .   this   one   s   a   winner !
what   a   waste !   this   blowdryer   is   not   worth   the   money !   i   bought   it   less   than   a   year   ago   and   not   only   is   the   claim   cut   your   blowdrying   time   in   half   a   lie ,   it   takes   me   1   hr   and   15   minutes   to   blowdry   my   hair   ,   lately   it   has   been   blowing   out   cold   air   all   of   a   sudden   in   the   middle   of   my   blowdrying   session .   also ,   if   you   don   t   purchase   from   an   authorized   dealer   your   warranty   will   not   be   honored .   the   t3   bespoke   labs   people   don   t   even   have   an   official   website !   this   is   a   farce !   don   t   waste   your   time   and   money .
replacement   unit   this   was   bought   to   replace   the   same   unit   that   had   mysteriously   stopped   working   after   several   years   of   heavy   use .   obviously   we   like   the   performance   and   convienience   of   a   wall   mounted   blow   dryer .   nothing   fancy ,   but   handy .
hand   hand   dryer   this   is   the   nicest   hair   dryer   we   have   ever   owned .   br   this   is   number   3   we   have   purchased   over   the   last   10   years .   br   the   first   cost   90.00   and   had   no   night   light .   br   now   we   buy   the   ones   with   the   led   night   light   uses   little   to   no   electricity .   the   dyrer   is   wonderfull .   we   bought   it   because   the   hotel   we   stayed   in   florida   had   them   and   thought   what   a   great   idea .   no   more   wires   or   the   unit   on   the   counter .   we   also   thought   it   must   be   good   for   everday   use   by   different   types   of   people .   we   really   love   it .   br   it   will   go   into   our   new   2   baths   so   i   will   be   buying   two   more   soon .
no   more   frizzy   hair !   for   my   entire   half   century   of   life ,   i   ve   been   blessed   with   curly   hair   which   morphs   to   piles   of   frizz   in   rainy ,   snowy   or   humid   weather .   regular   hand   held   hair   dryers   never   quite   dried   my   very   thick   hair   and   didn   t   prevent   the   frizz .   this   one   not   only   dries   my   hair ,   but   does   so   quickly   and   a   lot   more   quietly   than   any   other   i   ve   used .   the   best   thing   is   that   it   really   does   reduce   the   frizzfactor   significantly .   i   won   t   claim   it   s   completely   gone ,   but   having   90   less   frizz   is   cause   for   celebration   and   a   four   star   rating .   by   the   way ,   i   live   in   hotlanta   where   frizzy   hair   weather   lasts   longer   than   a   maine   winter .
no   warranty   night   light   went   out   after   2   months ,   i   found   out   the   warranty   was   only   for   1   month .....   this   is   a   good   product   but   the   warranty   sucks .   br   i   am   going   for   a   full   refund   through   american   express ..   not   through   amazon   . lost   in   the   woods ...
just   like   a   hotel   room   i   was   looking   for   a   simple   wall   mountable   hair   dryer   just   like   the   ones   found   in   a   typical   hotel   room .   this   fit   the   bill   perfectly .   good   enough   for   my   simple   needs .   it   s   worked   fine   with   no   problems   at   all .
just   what   i   ve   been   trying   to   find !   i   have   a   very   old   conair   prostyle   1600   my   favorite   hand   held   dryer ,   and   after   over   10   years ,   it   s   been   on   its   way   out .   i   ve   tryed   various   dryers ,   but   none   of   them   have   the   great   feel   of   my   old   conair .   i   just   recently   ordered   the   conair   yellowbird   1875 ... thought   it   would   be   great   looked   just   like   my   old   one ,   only   yellow .   i   tried   it   once   and   sent   it   back .   it   was   too   heavy .. unlike   the   conair   1600 ,   which   was   oh   so   light ... and   surprisingly   didn   t   have   the   blow   power   i   expected .   so   i   read   one   review   on   the   andis   pro   style   1600   and   it   sounded   good .   i   tried   it   this   morning   and   it   s   perfect   very   light ... and   so   small ,   i   couldn   t   believe   it .   i   travel   on   business   and   have   not   found   a   travel   dryer   i   m   happy   with ,   so   i   m   going   to   order   another   of   these   for   a   travel   dryer .
it   works .   it   works .   the   cord   feature   is   great .   the   price   is   right .   what   else   is   there   to   say .
powerful   and   convenient   i   love   my   andis   ionic   ceramic   hair   dryer ,   i   throw   it   in   my   travel   bag ,   it   has   all   the   power   of   a   bigger ,   heavier   dryer .   i   love   the   retracting   cord   and   folding   feature ,   it   stores   neatly   at   home   as   well .   awesome   product .
poor   quality   i   bought   this   hairdryer   as   a   gift   for   my   84   year   old   mom   and   it   does   not   work   as   promised .   the   adjustment   for   height   is   hard   to   use   the   dryer   doesn   t   dry   the   back   of   the   hair ,   just   the   front . also ,   it   has   collapsed   while   she   was   sitting   under   it   ,   so   not   only   doesn   t   it   work   properly   but   it   is   also   potentially   dangerous   .   i   would   definitely   not   buy   this   hairdryer .
not   impressed   i   would   not   advise   anybody   to   buy   this   product .   it   is   the   noisest   hard   hat   hair   dryer   i   have   ever   heard .   it   takes   extremely   long   to   dry   my   hair .   i   wanted   to   send   it   back   to   the   manufacterer   but   i   have   no   money   to   waste   on   shipping   so   i   decided   to   just   live   with   it   and   consider   it   a   loss .
queens ,   new   york   i   travel   quite   often   to   beach   resorts ,   i   needed   a   dual   voltage   220v   hair   dryer   not   more   than   1600   watts   .   this   hair   dryer   works   very   well .   i   will   buy   soon   an   adapter   plug   usa   to   europe   .   this   is   the   best   blow   dryer   i   ever   had .
nice   but   loud   i   picked   this   model   because   it   didn   t   have   the   goofy   nightlight   and   it   is   the   same   one   they   have   installed   at   the   local   healthclub .   the   quality   seems   on   par   with   ones   i   ve   used   in   hotels ,   but   it   is   loud   on   the   highest   setting .   my   wife   thought   it   had   too   much   force   with   the   nozzle   on   the   front   but   you   can   take   it   off   with   a   quarter   turn .   comes   with   those   standard   plastic   inserts   for   drywall ,   but   i   used   they   kind   that   look   like   a   big   spiral   that   you   twist   right   into   the   drwyall   with   a   screwdriver .   it   s   pretty   easy   to   mount   with   the   included   template   or   just   use   the   metal   backplate   to   mark   the   wall .   shipped   in   a   no   frills   plain   brown   box ,   so   i   would   imagine   that   it   is   marketed   to   hotels   and   installers   that   order   them   in   bulk .
great   dryer   this   dryer   is   the   perfect   size   for   travel   and   its   performance   is   outstanding .
jerdon   wall   mount   hair   dryer   this   is   a   replacement   for   the   same   model   hair   dryer .   the   first   one   lasted   over   6   yrs .   i   like   the   convenience   of   having   it   mounted   on   the   wall   rather   than   taking   space   on   the   counter .   i   could   not   find   one   in   the   local   stores   and   found   the   best   price   on   amazon . com
very   happy   great   hair   dryer .   i   tried   it   in   on   of   hotels ,   liked   a   lot   and   bought   5   for   each   room   in   the   apartment .   powerful ,   nice   grip ,   light   and   not   too   noisy .   great   price ,   too .
happy   hair   this   hair   dryer   is   identical   to   the   one   used   by   my   stylist   and   i   paid   the   exact   same   price   he   did .   i   have   some   natural   wave   to   my   hair   and   while   the   dryer   doesn   t   straighten   every   hair   on   my   head ,   it   does   a   better   job   than   a   regular   dryer   does .   my   hair   tends   to   retain   water ,   but   i   would   say   drying   time   is   less   than   five   minutes   with   this   dryer   my   hair   is   shoulder   length   .   at   my   last   cut ,   my   stylist   remarked   that   my   hair   is   in   good   condition   about   a   month   after   i   d   been   using   the   dryer .   the   dryer   does   get   hot ,   but   not   to   the   degree   my   other   dryers   have .   granted ,   i   don   t   have   a   warranty   with   it ,   but   i   m   very   happy   with   this   appliance .
hair   dryer   previously   i   had   farberware   1500w   wall   mounted   hair   dryer   i   was   very   happy   with   it . even   though   andis   is   1600w   still   it   feels   little   less   powerful   all   plastic   doesn   t   look   very   durable . handle   is   small   stumpy .   br   otherwise   it   is   o . k .   night   light   is   a   good   feature .
good   hair   dryer   i   like   the   hair   dryer ,   but   i   don   t   like   the   fact   that   the   bonnet   doesn   t   stay   puffed   up   with   air   as   it   dries   your   hair .   the   high   choice   of   hot   air   does   not   give   off   extremely   hot   air   as   many   dryers   do ,   and   this   is   a   plus   for   me .   i   don   t   like   to   get   scalded   while   i   m   drying   my   hair .
a   good   product   this   is   a   good   product   at   a   good   price .   i   wish   for   more   choices   high   medium   low   power   and   heat   but   it   does   a   real   good   job   and   the   night   light   has   been   a   bonus   for   our   guests
decent   product   i   ve   been   using   a   super   solano   professional   dryer   for   years   but   was   burning   my   hair ,   so ,   after   a   lot   of   internet   research ,   decided   to   try   this   model .   this   dryer   does   not   push   out   as   much   air ,   but   it   is   much   lighter   and   quieter   which   at   first   made   me   think   it   was   not   doing   as   good   a   job .   to   my   surprise ,   it   actually   did   a   better   job   in   the   same   amount   of   time .   despite   the   heat ,   no   burning   occurred ,   and   my   slightly   wavy   hair   was   nice   and   straight ,   shiny   and   smooth .   not   really   sure   what   ions   or   tourmaline   do ,   but   the   results   are   solid .
just   okay   but   stopped   working   we   have   a   home   full   of   blow   dryers ,   every   bathroom   has   one   and   we   keep   our   travel   bags   stocked   with   them   as   well .   this   one   performs   as   well   as   any   of   the   other   low   cost   models   we   ve   owned   but   it   died   8   months   into   our   use .
it   s   going   to   explode !   okay ,   maybe   not   exactly   explode ,   but   very   close .   after   my   20   year   old   conair   blow   dryer   was   literally   falling   apart   but   still   working !   ,   i   decided   it   was   time   to   treat   myself   to   a   new   blow   dryer   a   couple   of   weeks   ago .   i   have   very   thick ,   long ,   wavy   hair   that   i   usually   let   dry   naturally   after   drying   my   bangs   maybe   5   minutes   .   yesterday   i   thought   it   would   be   nice   to   dry   the   whole   mess   and   use   the   iron   on   it   something   i   may   do   once   a   month   because   of   the   time   and   effort   it   takes .   i   kick   it   up   to   the   high   setting   and   become   aware   of   a   hot   smell   after   a   couple   of   minutes ,   but   think   that   since   i   don   t   use   this   setting   very   often ,   it   s   just   using   coils   it   doesn   t   usually   use   wrong !   soon   it   pops ,   hisses ,   and   glows   a   nice   yellow   red   color   before   shutting   off .   i   then   realize   that   even   the   grip   is   hot   and   that   the   snake   of   smoke   coming   out   of   the   end   of   the   blow   dryer   is   a   death   knell   for   my   brand   new   device !   i   hope   that   maybe   it   ll   work   again   after   cooling   off ,   much   to   my   husband   s   amusement   who   said   that   smell   only   comes   with   electronic   death ,   but   no ,   it   s   forever   dead .
dries   hair   quickly   with   below   the   shoulder   hair ,   i   found   this   to   dry   it   quickly   and   without   burning .   i   have   fine ,   thick   hair   so   usually   it   takes   10   minutes   or   more   to   dry   ...   and   other   dryers   run   so   hot   that   they   burn   if   focused   in   one   spot   for   more   than   a   moment   to   set   a   wave ,   for   instance   .   this   gets   just   hot   enough   to   be   safe   and   pleasant   to   use .   br   br   the   finger   attachment   might   be   useful   if   someone   else   is   styling   your   hair ,   but   my   arms   i   m   5   9   aren   t   long   enough   to   make   its   use   practicable .   br   br   two   speeds ,   two   heat   settings   plus   cold   shot   button   actually   give   a   very   usable   range   for   drying   efficiently .   took   me   less   time   than   with   my   previous   dryer .
does   a   great   job !   i   have   used   this   product   for   6   years .   my   hairdresser   introduced   me   to   it   and   i   now   use   it   at   home .   its   great   for   mustache   areas   and   eyebrows .   it   grabs   the   fine   hairs   and   doesnt   let   go .   i   highly   recommend   this ! !
finally ,   a   hair   styling   tool   that   works ! ! !   i   wholeheartedly   agree   with   another   reviewer   that   this   product   is   awesome !   it   leaves   my   hair   soft ,   shiny ,   sleek   and   smooth   with   not   a   trace   of   dryness   or   frizziness .   pair   it   with   the   t3   tourmaline   featherweight   hairdryer   and   you   ll   have   salon   quality   hair .   highly   recommend !
clean   teeth   and   fresh   breath !   this   is   an   outstanding   product !   i   was   a   bit   hesitant   to   order   it   given   some   of   the   reviews ,   but   when   it   was   discounted   on   a   friday   sale ,   i   figured   i   d   give   it   a   shot .   so   glad   i   did !   br   br   to   get   the   most   out   of   the   unit   you   have   to   read   the   manual .   it   clearly   states   that   you   should   not   leave   water   in   the   reservoir   why   you   would   want   to   anyway   is   beyond   me   why   would   anyone   want   to   use   stale   water   .   if   you   don   t   leave   water   in   it ,   it   won   t   leak   out   on   your   counter .   pretty   simple   equation   there .   br   br   i   agree   with   several   others   that   the   tongue   cleaning   attachments   are   basically   useless .   they   don   t   fit   into   the   holder   anyway ,   so   just   toss   them   out .   sure ,   try   it ,   but   i   ll   bet   you   ll   find   it   to   be   basically   useless   compared   with   a   true   tongue   cleaner   i . e . ,   a   scraper   type   device   .   br   br   the   water   reservoir   could   be   a   bit   bigger   an   additional   20   bigger   would   be   nice .   but ,   it   s   very   easy   to   fill   even   when   the   unit   is   running   keep   a   glass   of   water   handy   and   just   pour   it   in   when   the   water   level   is   at   the   half   way   point   .   simple   and   easy ,   and   the   smaller   reservoir   does   have   the   benefit   of   keeping   the   unit   size   nice   and   compact .   br   br   sound   level   is   very   low   compared   with   past   waterpik   units .   no ,   it   s   not   silent ,   but   it   is   no   more   noise   than   you   would   get   with   any   other   electric   appliance   in   the   bathroom   such   as   an   electric   toothbrush   or   a   shaver .   in   fact ,   it   is   less   noise   than   my   shaver .   br   br   the   auto   retractable   hose   is   a   very   nice   touch   and   keeps   everything   neat .   again ,   a   couple   inches   longer   would   be   nice ,   but   there   s   the   compact   size   trade   off   again .   br   br   in   actual   performance   wow !   you   will   never   believe   that   your   teeth   could   get   this   clean !   wonderful   feeling .   there   is   a   wide   range   of   power   adjustments   ranging   from   very   gentle   to   ouch !   i   ve   found   setting   the   dial   to   the   5   6   range   gives   a   good   cleaning   without   any   discomfort .   br   br   good   performance   at   a   good   price   can   t   ask   for   more   than   that .
intoxicating !   i   was   blown   away   when   i   first   smelled   this   frangrance ..   it   is   truly   unique .   now ,   i   m   not   a   huge   fan   of   pineapple ,   so   when   i   was   told   that   was   part   of   the   scent ,   i   was   leary .   but   it   is   extremely   subtle   and   well   balanced   with   the   other   components   of   this   complicated   perfume .   i   immediately   bought   a   bottle   and   a   tube   of   the   lipgloss ,   which   i   love   too !   ,   and   am   going   to   stock   up   on   more .   it   s   a   limited   edition !   and   it   s   totally   worth   the   price .   i   gave   this   perfume   5   stars ,   because   i   ll   buy   more   for   myself ,   and   i   would   reccomend   it   to   any   woman   anywhere .
my   previous   er389   lasted   2   years   i   just   ordered   a   new   er389   because   my   current   one   died   after   a   little   over   two   years   of   use .   it   was   a   nice   little   trimmer   while   it   lasted ,   but   i   really   don   t   think   i   should   be   filling   landfills   with   dead   trimmers   every   two   years .   if   a   frequent   problem   with   these   devices   is   that   the   batteries   die ,   i   d   be   happy   with   a   long   lasting   trimmer   with   an   old   fashioned   power   cord .   by   the   way ,   i   previously   owned   a   wahl   battery   only   portable   trimmer   and   a   wahl   ac   trimmer ,   and   they   both   had   short   lives .   br   br  
really   gets   remaining   make   up   dirt   off   and   skin   feels   smooth   none   available .
worth   the   money !   definitely   worth   the   money .   i   have   been   using   this   for   a   couple   of   months   and   have   had   no   problems   with .   was   nervous   the   first   time   i   washed   it   in   the   washing   machine ,   but   it   came   out   like   new .
not   for   lined ,   aging   skin   i   am   63   and   really   wanted   to   try   this .   i   swirled   and   tapped   and   noticed   that   the   places   on   my   face   that   are   not   lined   turned   out   nice .   but   i   wanted   a   little   more   coverage   due   to   some   spider   veins   and   2   age   spots .   so   i   put   a   second   coat   on   and   these   lines   under   one   eye   really   stood   out !   i   didn   t   know   i   had   them   until   i   used   this   product !   so   i   got   some   makeup   remover   and   took   off   the   bare   minerals   that   was   on   top   of   the   lines   and   they   disappeared !   on   those ,   i   put   my   regular   liquid   foundation   on   the   lines   and   all   was   well .   br   i   think   you   should   have   nearly   perfect   skin   for   this   to   work   nicely .
excellent   not   pure   lavender   oil   but   it   works   well .   it   is   not   too   greasy   and   it   is   very   flexible   in   the   way   it   can   be   used .   you   can   use   it   in   baths ,   after   shower   bath   or   in   massages .   better   than   advertised .
fantastic   not   much   can   be   said   about   a   product   that   is   pretty   perfect   in   every   respect .   i   have   been   using   this   toothbrush   for   almost   two   years   now   and   cannot   imagine   ever   going   back   to   hand   brushing .   there   is   such   a   marked   difference   between   this   and   hand   brushing   that   you   can   literally   feel .   my   teeth   have   never   felt   cleaner   and   my   gums   have   never   been   healthier .   while   i   used   to   have   pretty   bad   dental   hygiene   habits   i   used   to   brush   only   about   two   times   a   day   this   toothbrush   has   helped   me   improve   me   regimen   tremendously .   the   results   have   been   nothing   short   of   miraculous .   br   br   i   take   this   toothbrush   everywhere   i   can   and   the   charge   tends   to   last   several   days   before   recharging   is   needed .   at   any   rate ,   i   suppose   the   only   shortcoming   of   this   toothbrush   lies   in   the   problems   encountered   when   traveling   a   lot   the   base   station   is   simply   too   bulky   to   conveniently   pack   away   and   take   with   you .   while   this   is   not   an   issue   on   shorter   trips ,   travelling   in   excess   of   a   week   will   make   you   scramble   for   an   alternative   travel   toothbrush .   if   this   toothbrush   came   with   a   smaller   travel   charger ,   it   would   indeed   be   absolutely   perfect .
best   sunscreen   i   ve   ever   used !   this   sunscreen   is   absolutely   fantastic !   i   have   tried   everythin   on   the   market   i   have   eczema ,   skin   sensitivities ,   etc .   though   many   were   okay ,   all   had   some   disadvantage   until   i   found   antheliosspf   40 .   i   first   tried   it   on   a   2   week   trip   to   a   tropical   beach   had   absolutely   no   negative   skin   reactions   to   it   at   all .   not   only   that ,   but   i   did   not   get   even   a   hint   of   sunburn   while   surrounded   by   people   who   were   broiling   red .   it   does   take   a   few   minutes   to   rub   in ,   which   you   are   supposed   to   do   in   any   case   in   order   to   give   any   sunscreen   time   to   work   before   you   go   out   into   the   sun .   it   even   worked   perfectly   on   my   face   caused   no   plugged   pores   or   skin   reactions .   very   highly   recommended ! !
perfect   brows !   i   actually   went   to   anastasia   beverly   hills ,   and   had   my   brows   shaped   by   katie   who   did   a   great   job ,   by   the   way .   so ,   i   bought   this   kit   so   that   i   could   repeat   the   effect   between   visits .   i   don   t   live   near   beverly   hills   anymore ,   so   this   was   a   must .   my   brows   were   a   little   thin ,   and   so   i   am   growing   them   out   a   little .   filling   them   in   in   the   mean   time   is   really   helpful .   i   was   worried   that   i   wouldn   t   be   able   to   recreate   my   perfect   brows   at   home ,   but   this   kit   was   soo   easy   to   use .   i   just   used   the   stencil ,   and   the   brow   powder ,   and   viola   my   brows   looked   great   again ,   and   most   importantly   natural .   sometimes   i   ve   used   brow   products   that   looked   unnatural   but   this   stuff   is   of   great   quality .   i   would   definately   recommend   it .   it   may   seem   pricey   but   it   is   worth   it .   and ,   if   you   ever   get   a   chance   to   go   to   anastasia   s   salon   do   so ..   you   don   t   even   have   to   go   to   anastasia   herself .   everyone   walking   out   of   there   had   great   brows !
does   what   all   the   other   products   should   do   this   is   wonderful .   it   is   also   a   bit   moisturizing .   that   is   one   or   two   steps   up   from   non   drying .   at   least   you   don   t   feel   your   lips   tightening   throught   the   day .   they   are   comfortable .   the   trick   is   to   pat   it   in .   your   lipstick   or   gloss   will   really   stay .   watch   out   for   the   one   problem   with   all   primers   they   are   beige .   your   lips   aren   t .   i   didn   t   like   the   look   of   glosses ,   because   you   are   supposed   to   see   the   lip   through   them .   you   might   want   to   put   a   bit   of   lipstick   on   before   your   gloss .   but   your   lipsticks   will   absolutely   be   the   color   they   are   in   the   tube .   no   more   problems   with   the   ones   that   turn   color   on   their   own .   you   are   free   to   pick   out   the   color   you   like .   and   all   lipsticks   will   look   smoother   than   ever   and   stay   on .   and   really   truly ,   no   feathering   or   bleeding .   i   don   t   even   try   the   others   any   more .   i   do   put   it   in   my   purse   for   after   lunch .   that   is   the   only   time   during   the   day   that   i   wear   it   off .   for   the   rest   of   the   day   you   may   have   to   reapply   lipstick   mid   morning   or   mid   afternoon ,   depending   on   how   much   talking   you   have   done ,   but   the   price   of   the   primer   is   worth   it   1 .   because   it   works   and   2 .   your   lipcolor   is   going   to   last   a   lot   longer .
the   scent   is   not   that   great   i   have   yet   to   use   it   tanning ,   but   the   smell   is   very   musky   and   strong .   i   was   hoping   for   a   sweeter   scent .   it   seems   to   make   my   skin   soft   though .
good   dryer   but   horrible   bonnet   the   bonnet   is   very   flimsy   and   doesn   t   last   long .   too   bad   as   the   dryer   is   very   good   and   compact .   if   they   make   one   with   a   decent   bonnet ,   i   m   there   but   this   lasted   about   6   uses   and   the   bonnet   broke   off .
great   product   for   the   price   it   s   o   much   better   than   lotion ! ! ! !   i   ve   been   using   lotions   and   going   to   tanning   beds   for   a   while ,   i   decided   to   try   this   just   because   it   was   on   sale   and   it   turned   out   to   be   great ! ! !   you   have   to   follow   directions   to   get   expected   results ...   and   everytime   you   apply   it   you   get   better   at   it .   i   like   to   apply   it   right   after   a   shower   use   lotion   before   applying   .   great   natural   color ,   dries   quick ,   no   weird   smell ,   doesn   t   turn   pamls   orange ,   doesn   t   tranfer   to   clothes
this   stuff   is   awful !   i   bought   the   combo   pack   for   this   which   included   the   cleansing   lotion ,   toner   and   moisturizer   it   was   a   waste   of   money .   the   cleanser   was   worst   of   all ,   it   was   drying ,   did   not   cleanse   well ,   and   i   broke   out   soon   after   using   it   and   the   other   products   asin   b000h3da5c   almay   daily   moisturizer   for   normal   combo   skin   with   grape   seed ,   spf   15 ,   4   fl   oz   118   ml   pack   of   2   .   the   moisturizer   is   chalky   smelling   and   not   very   hydrating .   i   could   not   recommend   this   to   anyone .
it   works ,   but   do   be   aware   that   it   says   3   months   for   minimal   effects .   i   ve   used   this   product   for   about   2   months ,   it   did   somewhat   whiten   my   teeth   and   i   had   no   side   effects .   i   stopped   using   it   only   because   i   did   not   deem   it   necessary   to   continue   to   buy   it   as   i   was   using   a   trial   that   came   free   on   my   listerine .   br   br   hairy   tongue   and   all   other   side   effects   people   have   mentioned   can   be   caused   by   regular   use   of   mouthwashes   containing   oxidizing   agents ,   such   as   peroxide ,   or   astringent   agents ,   such   as   witch   hazel   or   menthol .   its   an   allergic   reaction ,   don   t   blame   the   product .
good   stuff   i   use   organic   root   stimulator   to   freshen   my   scalp   after   a   workout .   good   stuff .   be   careful   not   to   overuse   this   product .   it   will   cause   buildup   on   your   scalp   if   you   use   it   too   often .   nothing   fully   replaces   a   vigorous   scalp   scrub   in   the   shower !
doubtful   like   its   predecessor ,   this   does   make   your   lips   a   deeper   color   and   a   teensy   weensy   bit   plumper ,   but   i   ve   been   using   it   for   1   week   now   and   have   my   doubts   about   maxiderm   s   collagen   boosting   effect .   if   my   opinion   changes ,   i   ll   update   the   review   but   as   of   now ,   i   d   say   save   the   10   bucks   and   get   original   lip   venom .   okay ! ! !   update !   it   works ! ! !   after   2   weeks   of   two   to   three   times   a   day   application ,   my   pout   is   definitely   poutier ... yay !   also ,   i   tested   it   on   an   18   year   old   co   worker   i   am   30   and   it   had   immediate   results .   hmmm ,   don   t   know   why ,   but   yes ,   great   product ,   it   works !
perfect   i   dropped   my   last   full   sized   ionic   hair   dryer   in   the   toilet ,   so   i   have   been   using   the   andis   on   a   daily   basis   now .   it   works   just   as   well   or   better   and   leaves   my   hair   feeling   silky   and   shiny .   i   highly   recommend   it ,   if   for   nothing   other   than   the   low   price !
hangup   hair   dryer   w   night   light   dryer   is   very   quiet   and   powerful .   easy   to   install .   night   light   has   a   nice   green   glow .   highly   recommend   this   product .
i   m   pleased !   none   available .
love   this   hair   dryer !   okay ,   i   haven   t   owned   a   new   hair   dryer   for   over   25   years ,   but   i   must   say ,   this   one   is   exactly   perfect   and   has   everything   i   would   ever   want   in   a   hair   dryer .   it   has   a   retractible   chord   and   is   and   dries   my   hair   quickly ,   leaving   it   soft   and   frizz   free .   i   highly   recommend   this   product .
good   product ,   but   heavy   the   product   is   really   good ,   the   hair   becomes   shine   and   soft .   the   only   problem   which   is   a   big   one   for   me ,   since   i   have   a   lot   of   hair   is   that   it   is   heavier   than   i   exoected   and   i   get   really   tired   when   i   dry   all   my   hair .
light ,   quiet ,   fantastic   and   fast !   after   having   read   the   majority   of   the   reviews   here ,   i   m   happy   to   report   that   this   dryer   is   fast   and   very   lightweight .   my   hairdresser   who   uses   this   dryer   daily   had   recommended   it   to   me   awhile   back .   unfortunately ,   i   bought   back   then   what   i   thought   was   a   better   more   economical   option   an   andis   ionic   hairdryer   with   a   retractable   cord   and   folding   handle .   while   very   light   weight   and   space   saving ,   i   soon   learned   after   several   months   of   frequent   use   that   either   the   cord   was   going   to   fray   from   from   the   retracting   into   the   handle   or   worse ,   the   handle   could   break   from   folding .   well ,   it   did .   after   the   handle   broke ,   i   decided   to   purchase   this   hair   dryer   and   i   regret   not   having   done   so   sooner .   what   a   great   hairdryer   very   lightweight ,   dries   hair   quickly   to   a   smooth   satiny   shine .   i   have   straight ,   medium   length ,   medium   thickness   hair   that   usually   would   take   at   least   45   minutes   to   dry .   well ,   the   t3   cut   the   drying   time   to   14   minutes   and   that   s   taking   my   time .   the   t3   dryer   is   also   very   quiet   and   despite   having   only   2   speeds   and   a   cold   shot   button ,   does   the   job   quite   nicely   and   i   don   t   miss   having   all   of   the   other   speeds .   this   was   well   worth   the   price   and   i   wouldn   t   ordinarily   spend   this   much   on   a   hair   dryer .   but   the   results   are   well   worth   it .   highly   recommend !
switch   broke   hair   dryer   worked   good   for   about   1   year .   then   the   switch   broke ,   fused   in   the   open   position . i   would   not   buy   an   andis   product   again .
great   concept   but   exceedingly   short   shelf   life   i   eagerly   snapped   up   this   ionic   hair   dryer   about   over   a   year   ago   because   of   it   s   retractable   cord   and   folding   capabilities .   even   the   price   was   attractive .   it   really   did   take   up   little   room   in   my   bathroom   drawer   and   the   retractable   cord   was   a   plus .   i   thought   i   had   the   perfect   blow   dryer   because   it   did   what   it   was   supposed   to   do   and   quickly .   now   for   the   bad   news   the   retractable   cord   became   chewed   up   and   frayed   after   daily   use   and   it   became   apparent   that   the   cord   was   ultimately   going   to   fray   completely   in   due   time .   then ,   the   folding   handle ,   low   and   behold ,   broke   in   half   one   morning .   of   course ,   the   warranty   had   long   expired   .   this   dryer   is   too   fragile   to   consider   using   on   a   daily   basis   and   i   consider   myself   a   careful   person   when   it   comes   to   handling   small   appliances   such   as   hair   dryers .   when   i   ve   replaced   hair   dryers   in   the   past ,   it   was   been   because   they   ve   simply   reached   the   end   of   their   lifespans   and   burned   out .   i   d   caution   anyone   to   consider   this   before   buying   because   these   2   features   alone ,   while   very   appealing ,   can   shorten   an   otherwise   good   hairdryer   s   lifespan .   i   ve   now   purchased   a   t3   tourmaline   a   featherweight ,   quiet   hairdryer   with   no   retractable   cord   or   folding   handle   which   seems   to   work   just   fine   and   appears   to   have   a   much   longer   lifespan .
product   is   junk ! ! ! !   i   recieved   this   product   yesterday   and   used   it   first   thing   this   morning .   i   turned   it   on   to   high   and   the   on   air   flow   button   broke .   it   is   stuck   on   high   and   just   slides   up   and   down .   i   had   to   un   plug   it   and   re   plug   it   into   the   outlet   to   use   it   this   morning .   this   is   made   cheaply   and   is   junk ,   do   not   spend   your   money   on   this   dryer .
cool   hair   dryer   i   got   this   for   christmas   and   i   love   it .   it   is   very   high   powered   for   being   a   hello   kitty   hair   dryer .   i   was   surprised .   it   is   very   cute   with   a   great   price .
very   good ,   but   consumes   a   lot   of   power .   works   well ,   and   even   the   cool   shot   is   very   powerfull .   this   runs   around   1800   watts   and   does   not   work   in   other   voltages   execpt   for   us .   does   not   work   for   50   210   240   .   only   works   in   60   110v .   the   cord   is   long   enough .
evolution   hair   dryer   this   is   exactly   what   i   expected   and   works   very   good .   worth   the   cost .
good ,   but   not   great   when   my   conair   ionshine   hairdryer   broke   two   months   ago ,   i   tried   to   purchase   the   exact   same   model .   i   liked   the   way   it   made   my   hair   look   soft ,   shiny   and   without   frizz .   although   this   newer   version   of   the   ion   shine   hairdryer   should   have   improved   on   the   preceding   models ,   it   falls   short   of   my   older   version .   the   switches ,   which   respond   to   very   little   pressure ,   are   placed   directly   where   i   want   to   put   my   hand   and   it   is   inevitable   that   i   end   up   accidentally   switching   the   hairdryer   off   or   changing   the   heat   setting .   the   hairdryer   is   also   a   bit   unwieldy   if   one   wants   to   use   the   extensions .   on   the   plus   side ,   it   speedily   dries   my   hair   and   leaves   it   as   shiny   as   my   previous   ion   shine .
good   hair   dryer   for   the   price   i   have   purchased   four   jerdon   wall   mount   hair   dryers   one   for   my   home   and   three   for   our   lake   house .   they   are   dependable   and   affordably   priced .
mel   from   seattle   i   normally   don   t   like   to   invest   in   hair   products   items   that   are   this   expensive ,   so   i   thought   i   would   ask   for   it   from   my   boyfriend   on   valentine   s   day .   he   bought   me   both   the   featherweight   hair   dryer   and   the   wet   and   dry   narrow   flat   iron   from   t3 .   i   love   both   of   them !   the   hair   dryer   dries   my   hair   in   about   6   minutes   when   it   is   wet   from   the   shower   i   have   asian   hair   so   i   can   say   that   drying   my   hair   isn   t   always   a   positive   experience .   however ,   if   you   dry   your   hair   with   the   hot   option   first   doing   the   layers   ,   then   on   the   low   option   for   the   roots   of   your   hair ,   and   finishing   with   a   blast   of   cool   air   all   over ,   you   will   have   shiny   hair   that   is   not   poofy   and   is   manageable .   br   after   using   my   t3   hair   dryer ,   i   don   t   know   how   i   could   not   have   it .   now ,   i   want   to   get   the   overnight   dryer .   however ,   here   is   a   warning .   do   not   expect   miracles !   if   you   have   super   frizzy   hair   or   completely   unmanageable   hair ,   a   hair   dryer   will   not   fix   that .   perhaps   you   should   invest   in   some   better   shampoo   i   recommend   bumble   and   bumble   or   paul   mitchell   and   perhaps   a   hair   treatment   at   the   salon .   this   dryer   is   great   for   getting   the   job   done   quickly   and   to   make   your   hair   look   better   without   that   frizzy ,   burned   look   that   other   hair   dryers   give   you   .
i   no   longer   recommend   it   i   once   recommended   this   dryer   and   should   have   changed   my   review   years   ago .   the   retractable   cord   feature   on   the   one   i   bought   initially   very   soon   failed .   i   contacted   andis   and   they   sent   me   another   one ,   but   it   failed   in   the   same   way .   i   could   not   get   excited   about   going   to   the   trouble   of   fooling   with   it   again .   i   no   longer   possess   this   product   and   could   not   recommend   it .
excellent   hairdryer   my   wife   loves   the   hair   dryer   and   she   is   fussy   about   such   appliances   and   my   little   two   year   old   loves   the   retracting   cord !   good   dryer   at   a   good   price .
great   little   dryer ! !   the   bonnet   is   nice   and   large   and   the   air   flow   is   just   right   for   my   hair .   it   has   done   a   good   job   for   me .
great   hair   dryer !   i   bought   two   of   these ,   one   for   each   upstairs   bathroom .   the   arrived   quickly   and   at   first   glance ,   i   was   intimidated   about   installation .   then   after   reading   the   instructions ,   and   seeing   that   they   actually   include   a   paper   guide ,   you   just   tape   to   your   wall   and   drill   holes   where   the   dots   are ...   i   installed   both   of   these   completely   by   myself !   i   am   a   stay   at   home   mom ,   so   that   is   a   big   deal !   it   took   no   time   and   they   both   were   up !   they   brace   very   solid   against   the   wall .   the   dryer   worked   quite   well   and   was   very   quiet   compared   to   our   old   dryer .   it   also   has   automatic   shut   off ,   you   can   even   hang   it   up   while   it   is   on   and   it   will   shut   off   as   it   is   put   back   into   the   cradle .   very   nice !   i   would   buy   again   in   a   heartbeat !
product   good   retractable   cord   doesn   t   always   retract   but   i   didn   t   buy   it   for   that .   br   very   happy   with   the   way   it   dries   my   hair .
hot   tools   hair   dryer   review   this   product   is   of   good   quality .   it   s   lightweight ,   the   cord   is   long ,   it   s   a   little   quieter   than   my   previous   hair   dryer .   the   only   thing   i   didn   t   like   is   that   when   i   use   the   hottest   setting , it   s   not   as   hot   as   i   would   like   it .
works   great   i   really   like   this   hair   dryer .   it   dries   quickly ,   not   real   noisy ,   and   the   retractable   cord   is   a   great   convenience   in   my   tiny   bathroom .
wonderful   dryer   this   dryer   is   absolutely   wonderful .   my   hair   has   never   been   so   straight .
repeat   after   me   .   .   .   it   s   a   hair   dryer !   i   wasn   t   in   the   market   for   a   new   hair   dryer   but ,   thanks   to   my   husband ,   who   deep   sixed   my   old   one   using   it   to   thaw   frozen   water   pipes   at   our   cabin ,   i   needed   a   new   one .   he   thought   the   dryer   just   needed   to   rest   for   a   bit   and   then   it   would   be   fine   .   .   .   so   he   didn   t   bother   to   tell   me   it   had   blown   its   last   burst   of   air   under   our   kitchen   sink !   i   now   needed   to   find   a   replacement   hair   dryer ,   something   impossible   to   do   on   a   holiday   when   all   the   stores   are   closed   and   you   need   to   be   somewhere   in   half   an   hour !   br   fyi   if   you ,   too ,   have   a   husband   who   has   to   thaw   water   pipes   and   has   used   your   hair   dryer ,   for   that   purpose ,   i   suggest   you   point   him   in   the   direction   of   the   asin   b00004ti25   milwaukee   6   dual   temperature   heat   gun   .   if   he   takes   the   hint   you   can   avoid   having   to   go   to   a   very   important   family   event   scaring   small   children   and   some   adults ,   i   might   add !   looking   like   a   demented   survivor   from   a   shipwreck !   i   still   cannot   fathom   why   steam   coming   out   of   my   ears   and   fire   from   the   burning   coals   in   my   eyes   didn   t   dry   my   hair !   where   was   a   hot   flash   when   i   needed   one   i   m   over   it   or   i   will   be   as   soon   as   all   the   pictures   and   negatives   have   been   destroyed !   however ,   i   digress ,   so   back   to   my   review .   br   i   am   glad   i   selected   this   hair   dryer .   it   has   proved   to   be   an   excellent   choice .   dries   my   hair   much   faster   and   seems   to   leave   it   silkier   which   is   saying   a   lot   since   i   have   gray   hair   that   has   a   mind   of   its   own .   oh ,   by   the   way ,   my   hot   tools   hair   dryer   doesn   t   look   too   bad   chained   to   the   wall   in   our   bathroom !   mrs .   b .
great   little   dryer !   this   wall   mounted   hair   dryer   was   the   smallest   one   available ,   and   that   is   why   i   selected   it .   it   fits   perfectly   in   a   small   space ,   and   it   is   as   inconspicuous   as   a   wall   mounted   dryer   could   be .   it   works   very   well ,   too   it   is   quite   powerful   for   such   a   petite   dryer .   i   really   love   it !
... and   i   thought   the   ion   feature   was   hype !   the   initial   reason   for   buying   this   hair   dryer   was   to   replace   one   that   had   died .   my   decision   was   based   on   price   and   product   name   and   couldn   t   give   a   hoot   about   the   ion   feature .   after   a   few   weeks   of   use   the   woman   who   cuts   my   hair   remarked   that   my   hair   felt   smoother   and   was   laying   different .   good   to   know   that   it   wasn   t   my   imagination .   also ,   i   found   that   the   nozzle   is   a   lot   cooler   than   my   old   conair   dryer .   it   s   so   cool   in   fact   that   i   don   t   hesitate   putting   it   away   immediately   after   use .
love   this   dryer !   my   wife   just   loves   this   hair   dryer   so   convenient   no   more   hauling   the   old   one   out   from   under   the   sink ,   unplugging   the   nite   lite ,   etc .   and   the   nite   lite   is   great !   those   mid   night   visits   are   safe   and   lighted   no   fumbling   around   with   those   other   soft   lights   .
liked   it   so   much   i   bought   a   second   good   dryer ,   very   simple   and   has   a   nice   combination   of   settings .   drys   hair   very   fast   with   no   frizz   even   in   winter .   liked   the   first   one   so   much   i   bought   a   second .   br   br   update   i   thought   it   worth   updating   this   review ,   as   it   has   been   nearly   5   years   since   i   purchased   two   of   these   dryers ,   and   they   are   still   going   strong   with   daily   use !   one   of   the   things   that   i   have   come   to   really   appreciate   about   this   dryer   is   that   the   low   fan   setting   truly   is   low .   so   many   other   dryers   give   you   high   and   higher   as   choices .   i   don   t   want   to   achieve   the   head   out   the   car   window   look ,   i   want   just   enough   airflow   to   get   the   job   done .   of   course ,   there   is   a   high   setting   if   you   do   want   more .   the   other   noteworthy   thing   is   that   cleaning   lint   out   of   the   dryer   is   so   easy !   the   lint   screen   removes   very   easily   and   can   be   cleaned   in   seconds   and   replaced .   this   helps   keep   the   unit   working   efficiently   and   adds   to   its   life .
jerdon   1600w   wall   mount   hair   dryer   so   far   this   dryer   is   working   great !   another   brand   didn   t   last   1   year   so   i   hope   this   one   lasts   longer .
don   t   buy   this   or   any   other   andis   products   the   first   time   out   of   the   box   trying   the   retractable   cord ,   the   button   that   retracts   it   got   permantly   stuck   down .   i   am   sure   that   this   is   a   direct   indication   of   the   quality   of   andis   products   be   fore   warned ! ! !
small   wonder   light ,   dual   setting ,   powerful ,   compact .   an   excellent   product ,   very   reliable .   this   is   the   second   one   i   have   owned   the   first   lasted   for   eight   years   in   home   use   and   travelled   the   world !
hair   dryer   i   was   disappointed   in   this   product   as   the   bonnet   was   smaller   than   the   previous   dryer   i   was   using   by   hot   tools   and   had   problem   getting   on   over   my   large   rollers .   after   using   about   5   times   it   stopped   working .   i   will   say   that   it   is   compact   for   travelling   but   feel   that   it   is   undependable .   the   temperature   did   get   extremely   hot   so   for   a   quick   dry   it   was   good   from   that   standpoint .   i   ended   up   purchasing   another   hot   tools   dryer ,   a   little   more   money   but   worth   the   price   in   the   long   run .
a   retractable   hair   dryer   the   hair   dryer   cord   comes   in   handy .   now   i   don   t   need   to   make   sure   the   cord   isn   t   touched   by   water .   the   hair   dryer   has   a   softer   sound   to   it ,   so   it   doesn   t   disturb   any   one   in   the   house .
reasons   for   low   rating   the   very   first   thing   i   noticed   was   how   small   and   crammed   the   case   was .   it   was   almost   impossible   to   fit   everything   back   in   the   case   without   thinking   you   have   damaged   something .   br   the   other   thing   was   how   awkward   the   entire   assembly   was .   the   bonnnet   was   difficult   to   get   on ,   mainly   because   the   hose   connected   to   the   bonnet   was   heavy   and   in   an   awkward   place ,   and   kept   pulling   the   bonnet   off   my   head .   br   after   a   couple   of   trys   and   reading   the   instructions ,   i   knew   i   would   never   use   it ,   simply   because   it   was   such   a   struggle   just   to   get   it   on   your   head .   br   whoever   designed   this   product   should   be   demoted .
hotel   quality   we   have   found   the   andis   to   be   comperable   to   the   dryers   found   in   the   more   upscale   hotels .   the   hang   up   cord   is   a   great   feature   that   helps   keep   cords   organized .   the   night   light   gives   plenty   of   light   for   finding   your   way   around   the   bathroom   at   night .   two   speeds   supply   plenty   of   drying   power .   nice   design ,   easy   to   mount .
andis   hangup   hair   dryer   i   love   this   light   weight   hair   dryer ,   unfortunately   this   is   the   second   one   i   needed   to   buy   within   one   year .   dries   quickly ,   better   than   many   other   wall   mount   hair   dryers .   too   bad   it   died   within   10   months
andis   33805   micro   turbo   1600w   dual   voltage   hair   dryer   first   saw   this   unit   at   our   time   share   in   aruba .   it   is   very   compact ,   lightweight   and   extremely   powerful .   it   s   works   great .
hair   dryer   this   is   the   second   t3   i   have   purchased ,   the   second   was   for   a   gift .   it   dries   your   hair   fast .   saves   a   lot   of   time .   well   worth   the   price
great   hairdryer   this   hair   dryer   has   a   lot   of   power .   the   wall   mount   keeps   it   out   of   the   way ,   but   readily   accessible   when   needed .   this   is   a   replacement   hair   dryer   for   us   and   we   purchased   the   same   one   when   the   other   quit   working .
excellent   product   this   is   the   second   andis   hangup   hair   dryer   we   ve   had ..... the   first   one   was   more   than   10   yrs .   old   and   ran   great .... we   left   it   on   the   wall   when   we   sold   the   house   and   moved .... got   a   new   one   for   the   new   house ... couldn   t   be   happier   and   love   the   night   light   feature ...
good   experience   the   product   was   here   fast   and   it   works   great .   i   would   use   them   again .
nice   dryer !   this   dryer   is   very   light ,   very   quiet ,   and   does   not   burn   my   hair   or   dry   it   out .   i   can   dry   my   semi   long   hair   in   about   6   minutes ,   using   the   cool   shot   button ,   and   it   is   very   smooth   and   shiny .   i   think   it   has   helped   calm   the   fly   away   static   electricity   this   winter ,   but   not   completely .   until   now ,   i   ve   bought   inexpensive   dryers   that   last   about   3   months .   i   m   hoping   that   this   investment   will   last   a   bit   longer !   my   only   complaint   is   that   the   manufacturer   will   not   warranty   the   dryer   because   i   bought   it   through   amazon ,   which   is   not   a   certified   dealer .   so ,   any   problems   will   be   heading   right   for   amazon   s   customer   service   department !
conair   soft   bonnet   hair   dryer   i   have   nothing   but   good   review   of   this   product .   br   great   product   at   a   great   price .
not   for   amateurs   if   you   are   a   master   at   wielding   a   blow   dryer ,   you   ll   probably   love   this .   i   find   it   too   heavy   and   big   for   my   hands   when   i   am   using   the   blow   dryer   to   straighten   my   hair .   with   that   said ,   the   various   heat   settings   work   well .   the   concenrator   attachments   work   fine   for   me .   i   purchased   this   model   in   part   for   the   comb   attachment ,   but   i   can   t   manage   the   dryer   properly   with   it   attached .   br   br   update   when   i   am   not   using   the   dryer   to   straighten   my   super   curly   hair ,   i   like   it .   my   current   hairstyle   requires   an   hour   under   a   bonnet   dryer .   i   can   dry   my   hair   in   half   the   time   using   this   hand   held   dryer .
disappointment   after   using   the   dryer   which   i   liked   very   much   and   did   a   quick   job   ,   i   discovered   that   my   hair   was   being   ruined .   it   would   break   off   in   small   2   inch   curved   pieces .   br   br   i   stopped   using   it   for   a   month   and   confirmed   that   was   the   problem   because   the   lavatory   was   no   longer   filled   with   broken   pieces   of   hair .   br   br   i   would   like   to   return   it   and   get   my   money   back ! ! !   br   br   br  
great   hair   dryer   i   bought   this   item   because   i   was   going   to   europe   for   a   month .   i   didn   t   want   the   hassle   of   using   a   voltage   converter   because   you   can   only   use   one   electric   item   at   a   time ,   unless   you   buy   more   than   one   converter   kit .   you   do   need   a   plug   adaptor ,   these   are   relatively   inexpensive   ,   then   you   just   switch   the   voltage ,   plug   it   in   and   it   works   great .   i   used   it   in   switzerland ,   france   and   italy .   when   i   came   home   to   the   states   i   just   switched   the   voltage   back   and   i   now   use   it   at   home .   it   is   small   and   takes   up   very   little   space   in   the   suitcase .   i   would   recommend   it   for   anyone   in   need   of   a   hair   dryer   traveling   abroad .

andis   80020   the   first   one   i   received   was   broken   and   had   to   be   returned .   the   second   arrived   ok   but   the   cord   stopped   retracting   after   4mths   and   now   i   am   back   to   having   the   same   type   of   hairdryers   i   used   to   have .   not   impressed   with   the   dryer   at   all .
best   hair   dryer   for   the   money   i   recently   got   to   try   this   hair   dryer   in   a   marriott   hotel   and   was   pleasantly   surprised .   at   home   i   had   the   sharper   image   1875w   quiet   ionic   hair   dryer   and   this   is   what   i   am   comparing   it   to .   i   went   thru   two   of   the   sharper   images   ones   first   one   broke   which   are   much   more   expensive   and   my   biggest   complaint   always   was   that   it   scorched   my   head .   br   br   problems   gone   since   i   bought   this .   it   is   an   awesome   hair   dryer .   it   lays   in   your   hands   comfortably ,   is   sturdy   and   stores   away   in   a   breeze   as   it   folds   in   the   middle ,   plus   you   can   retract   the   cord .   on   top   of   that   it   does   not   scorch   or   burn   your   head   and   also   has   the   cool   air   feature   same   as   the   sharper   image   and   my   hair   comes   out   nice ,   soft   and   never   frizzy .   at   a   price   between   18   and   22   this   is   the   hair   dryer   to   buy .   i   did ,   and   only   wish   i   had   known   about   this   hair   dryer   earlier .   i   highly   recommend   it .   br   br   update   on   9   26   2009   almost   3   years   later   we   re   still   on   the   same   hair   dryer .   the   cord   needs   a   little   help   to   retract   but   nothing   has   given   up   on   it   yet .   it   has   been   dropped   a   few   times   too .   for   the   price   that   is   excellent   and   we   have   purchased   a   second   unit   for   our   other   bathroom .   much   better   than   the   sharper   image   version   which   is   way   more   expensive ,   scorches   your   head   and   won   t   last   long .   br   br   update   06   30   2016   the   hair   dryer   is   still   going   strong ,   cable   retracting   mechanism   is   broken   now   but   that   was   not   why   we   bought   it   in   the   first   place .   almost   10   years ,   not   bad   at   all !
great   little   hair   dryer   plenty   of   power .   plenty   of   heat .   like   the   night   light ,   but   would   like   to   be   able   to   switch   it   off   if   i   wanted   ...   but   can   t   do   that .   if   i   kept   this   near   my   ears   for   a   long   time ,   the   noise   would   be   an   issue ,   but   since   i   don   t ,   it   isn   t .   just   a   nice   little   device .

second   one   we   have   had   this   model   on   our   wall   for   years .   then   we   started   buying   them   from   amazon   vice   other   catalogs   sources .   two   in   two   years .   current   one   purchased   july   2006   and   broke   nov   2006 .   these   have   faulty   switches   that   melt   and   or   deform .   warranty   first   one   from   amazon   did   last   18   months   or   so .
everything   pink   bought   this   hairdryer   for   my   daughter   who   ownes   everything   in   pink .   she   loves   it .   it   is   light   and   has   good   airflow .   she   also   pointed   out   that   it   is   not   very   noisy   and   of   course ,   the   color   is   just   right .   br   br  
overall ,   i   am   very   pleased !   i   am   enjoying   my   new   remington   hair   dryer !   it   has   been   a   good   choice ,   i   believe .   i   especially   like   the   long   power   cord .   it   s   also   very   good   not   to   get   tangled .   my   only   complaint ,   if   you   want   to   call   it   that ,   is   that   i   had   expected   that   the   hair   dryer   would   be   quieter   than   it   is .   i   checked   around   before   i   purchased   it ,   and   one   of   the   selling   points   is   that   it   is   supposed   to   operate   more   quiet   than   your   average   hair   dryer ,   but   i   can   t   really   hear   much   of   a   difference ,   if   any .   regardless ,   i   am   enjoying   it !
not   bad   i   very   much   like   the   way   my   hair   comes   out   with   this   hairdryer .   less   frizz   and   dries   quickly .   the   only   thing   i   don   t   like   is   the   heaviness   of   the   dryer .   it   is   three   times   heavier   than   my   last   hair   dryer   and   after   a   while   my   arm   gets   tired .   if   light   weight   is   important   to   you ,   don   t   buy   this   one .   also ,   i   thought   the   price   was   pretty   good ,   but   i   have   actually   seen   similar   dryers   cheaper   at   costco .
finally !   a   dryer   that   meets   all   your   styling   needs .   it   s   not   often   that   you   can   find   one   that   is   suited   for   both   curly   and   straight   styles .   the   air   diffusing   attachment   is   perfect   for   creating   soft ,   frizz   free   curls   while   the   concentrator   nozzle   more   narrow   and   therefore   a   better   conductor   of   air   than   most   models   with   this   feature   allows   you   to   direct   air   exactly   where   you   want   it .   the   dryer   itself   features   two   speed   low   and   high   and   three   heat   settings   cool ,   warm   and   hot   ,   as   well   as   a   cold   shot   button   to   lock   in   style .   for   the   highest   heat   setting ,   simply   put   the   dryer   on   high   speed   and   the   hottest   setting   careful ,   though ... this   is   only   recommended   for   hair   that   s   uber   curly ,   like   mine   .   additionally ,   the   9   foot   long   cord   complete   with   a   loop   that   will   allow   you   to   hook   it   onto   something   in   your   bathroom   or   wherever   else   you   store   it   makes   it   really   easy   to   use .   another   bonus   even   on   the   highest   setting ,   the   dryer   is   considerably   more   quiet   than   other   ones   on   the   market   that   are   similarly   priced   you   can   easily   hold   a   conversation   while   speaking   in   a   normal   tone   of   voice   .   br   br   according   to   the   information   that   s   included   with   the   product ,   the   dryer   is   made   with   a   combination   pink   tourmaline   ceramic   technology   that   allows   for   a   special   emission   of   ions   these   are   important   for   eliminating   static   electricity   .   i   found   that   after   use ,   my   hair   actually   was   a   lot   smoother   even   than   when   i   used   previous   hair   dryers   with   ionic   technology   i   used   it   to   style   my   hair   both   in   its   naturally   curly   state   and   after   setting   it   in   rollers   to   blow   dry   it   straight .   if   your   hair   is   really   curly   like   mine ,   however ,   you   might   still   want   to   use   a   flatiron   to   get   that   pin   straight   look .   but   for   less   curly   hair   or   hair   that   s   less   prone   to   frizz ,   that   probably   won   t   be   necessary .   br   br   although   this   is   by   far   my   favorite   hair   dryer   i   ve   ever   owned ,   i   do   agree   with   the   previous   comment   on   this   product   it   really   would   be   the   perfect   dryer   if   it   had   a   folding   handle .   but   this   is   only   a   tiny   flaw ,   as   it   more   than   makes   up   for   that   missing   feature   with   its   humidity   resisting   technology .   well   done ,   remington .   an   invaluable   product   for   any   styling   arsenal .
soft   bonnet   review   i   like   a   soft   bonnet   hair   drier ,   because   it   drys   my   hair   softly   not   harshly   as   hand   held   dryers   do .   and   it   leaves   my   hands   free   to   do   other   things .   this   particular   one   is   compact   and   when   everything   is   packed   away ,   takes   up   little   shelf   space .   it   is   very   sturdy   too   and   i   really   like   the   long   hose .
conair   wall   mount   hair   dryer   this   hair   dryer   is   the   same   or   similar   to   units   we   have   used   in   hotels   when   we   have   traveled .   it   is   compact   but   powerful .   the   extra   feature   of   a   night   light   is   very   nice   for   our   home   use .   we   have   one   in   our   master   bath   and   our   guest   bath   and   would   recommend   this   item   to   friends .
good   dryer   for   the   price   its   too   hot   on   the   hot   setting   and   too   cold   on   the   warm .   try   not   keeping   it   too   long   on   your   hair   when   its   on   the   hot   setting .   br   br   good   luck
hair   dryer   has   a   nice   design   i   am   happy   with   my   purchase   of   this   hair   dryer ,   although   i   do   not   really   notice   much   of   a   difference   that   it   is   an   ionic   dryer .   the   look   is   modern ... it   appears   to   be   a   quality   product .
rapid   burnout   while   i   really   liked   the   dryer   s   performance   and   the   flexibility   of   using   it   with   either   the   concentrator   or   diffuser   attachments   it   came   with ,   i   m   really   disappointed   that   it   s   burned   out   and   inoperable   after   using   it   not   even   daily   or   at   the   highest   setting !   for   under   two   weeks .   br   br   like   another   reviewer ,   i   ve   waited   a   few   days   and   tried   resetting   the   plug   and   any   outlet   that   i   plug   it   into   all   the   outlets   work   with   other   appliances   and   this   dryer   is   definitely   dead   after   a   very   brief   run .   since   people   are   having   such   widely   varied   results ,   i   can   only   wonder   as   to   the   manufacturer   s   quality   control   process ,   possibly   letting   through   a   few   too   many   faulty   machines ...
works   great   for   4   months ,   and   then   dies !   i   gave   this   hair   dryer   to   my   wife   in   mid   april   for   her   birthday .   she   loved   it .   it   got   very   hot   and   dried   her   hair   in   about   10   minutes ,   which   was   a   whole   10   minutes   less   than   any   other   dryer   she   had   used .   everything   was   peachy   until   about   a   month   ago   september   when   all   of   a   sudden   it   started   making   a   terrible   squeeling   noise   which   required   a   bang   on   the   counter   to   get   working   properly .   the   constant   banging   lasted   for   about   a   month   and   now   it   squeels   and   doesn   t   get   hot   anymore .   all   said   and   done ,   this   is   a   great   dryer   if   you   only   want   it   for   4   months ,   but   for   this   kind   of   money   i   would   have   expected   it   to   last   a   lot   longer !
where   there   is   smoke   there   fire !   i   just   bought   this   and   opened   it   up .   i   thought   it   would   be   good   as   i   have   fine   long   hair .   br   br   i   used   it   for   about   10   minutes   and   something   popped   and   it   sounded   different   i   looked   inside   and   it   was   red   hot   and   started   smoking .   it   may   have   spit   out   sparks   as   i   felt   something   hit   my   head .   i   thought ,   this   thing   is   going   to   light   my   head   on   fire .   br   br   it   is   brand   new   and   it   won   t   work .   br   everytime   i   turn   it   on   it   starts   to   heat   up   and   smokes .   br   br   i   have   a   wonderful   revlon   hair   dryer   that   works   great ,   so   i   thought   it   would   be   good .   the   one   i   have   isn   t   ionic   and   wanted   to   try   it ,   guess   i   ll   go   back   to   the   old   one .   br   br   don   t   buy   it .
be   careful ! ! !   i   had   been   using   this   hairdryer   daily   for   about   a   year   or   so ...   until   today .   as   i   was   holding   it   above   my   head ,   drying   my   hair ,   i   heard   a   pop .   a   few   sparks   flew   out   the   end   and   into   my   hair   and   the   whole   thing   shut   off .   as   it   turns   out ,   the   area   where   the   cord   attaches   to   the   handle   got   so   hot   that   it   melted   through   the   plastic   coating ,   exposing   about   a   half   inch   of   singed   wires .   a   tad   bit   dangerous   if   you   asked   me !   granted ,   i   used   this   dryer   on   the   highest   heat   setting   everyday   for   a   year ,   so   i   got   a   lot   of   use   out   of   it ,   but   every   other   hairdryer   i   ve   had   in   the   past   simply   blows   cold   air   when   it   stops   working   properly   this   one   could   ve   caused   me   bodily   harm .   i   think   i   may   look   into   buying   a   different   brand   this   time   around .

hair   dryer   i   was   very   disappointed   that   the   company   would   not   honor   the   4   year   guarantee   because   i   got   this   on   amazon .   they   said   it   was   not   a   qualified   seller .   amazon   should   also   tell   buyers   that   if   you   purchase   this   item   on   amazon ,   the   company   will   not   honor   the   4   year   warranty .
disappointed   this   item   did   not   work   out   of   the   box .   i   returned   it .   should   be   no   stars .
the   best   hairdryer   ever ! ! ! ! !   i   used   this   hairdryer   for   the   first   time   in   a   hyatt   hotel   in   denver   colorado ,   and   the   results   were   unbelievable ! !   the   amount   of   time   to   blow   dry   my   long   hair   was   approximately   five   minutes   ! my   hair   was   so   full   of   body   and   shiny   i   didn   t   care   what   the   price   was   to   get   one   and   figuring   the   hyatt   used   it ,   i   was   ready   for   sticker   shock !   i   could   not   believe   that   i   found   it   on   amazon   for   19.00 .   it   is   so   worth   every   dollar   i   have   told   as   many   people   as   possible   and   they   look   at   me   like   i   m   crazy !   the   added   bonus   is   the   retractable   cord   and   folding   handle   i   have   hit   the   lottery !
a   good   buy   and   it   lasted   5   years   the   dryer   is   small   but   packs   enough   punch   for   my   wife .   installed   the   unit   when   we   remodeled   in   1998   and   it   just   died   this   morning .   i   m   buying   another   since   it   will   slide   right   into   the   space   vacated   by   the   old   one   i   won   t   have   any   wallpaper   issues   to   contend   with   and ,   for   20 ,   its   hard   to   beat   the   value .
good   purchase   but   not   super   quiet .   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   to   replace   one   that   is   so   loud ,   it   s   making   me   deaf .   on   high   setting ,   the   1069s   is   not   quiet ,   but   it   is   quieter   than   my   previous   one .   the   low   hum   of   the   motor   also   make   it   more   bearable .   more   importantly ,   the   high   hot   setting   does   not   produce   the   type   of   heat   the   can   burn   the   scalp   if   left   in   one   place   too   long .   yet ,   it   still   dries   my   hair   like   my   old   one .   i   d   give   it   a   5   star   if   it   was   quieter   like   it   s   advertized .
it   does   work   it   s   cheap ,   small ,   doing   job   enough   power   .   it   may   be   good   for   trip ,   but   the   hotel   i   stay   usually   has   a   dryer ,   so   i   don   t   bring   it .   if   you   look   for   a   compact   dryer ,   then   this   is   a   perfect   model   as   that   price .
fire ! ! ! !   i   have   used   three   of   these .   the   first   two   each   lasted   a   year   before   shorting   out .   i   kept   buying   them   because   i   liked   the   cordkeeper   function .   this   last   one ,   though ,   shorted   out   and   started   a   fire .   i   have   notified   the   company   and   will   see   what   happens .   but   i   doubt   that   i   will   purchase   another .   it   s   obvious   that   this   product   has   an   engineering   or   manufacturing   flaw   and   should   be   pulled   off   the   market .
disappointed   i   found   this   hair   dryer   to   be   much   bigger   then   anticipated .   the   cord   does   not   retract   completely   and   has   to   be   pushed   in   by   hand   br   for   the   last   few   inches .   it   is   heavy   and   the   handle   is   very   bulky .
very   good   dryer   i   looked   at   local   retail   stores   and   couldn   t   find   wall   mount   units .   don   t   know   why   anyone   would   want   one   just   lying   on   the   counter .   i   was   skeptical   of   the   ionic   feature ,   but   i   believe   my   hair   feels   softer   and   less   straw   like   after   using   this   dryer .   feels   well   made   and   should   last .   at   first   i   thought   the   high   speed   wasn   t   powerful   enough ,   but   i   think   the   quietness   of   this   unit   is   deceptive .   it   s   really   blowing   as   much   air   as   my   old   dryer ,   which   was   good ,   but   it   s   so   much   quieter   that   you   think   it   s   not   as   powerful .   the   night   light   is   quite   bright   and   is   a   pleasing   green ,   but   i   wish   i   could   turn   it   off   during   the   daytime .
it   s   called   snake   oil ...   a   colleague   bought   one   of   these   and   raved   about   it .   i   borrowed   it   so   my   wife   could   try   yes ,   it   is   lightweight ...   but   so   are   most   20   hairdryers .   wife   said   it   didn   t   dry   any   faster ,   didn   t   impress   her   as   being   anything   special .   someone   is   laughing   hard   all   the   way   to   the   bank   with   this .
don   t   buy   this   dryer   this   dryer   conked   out   after   i   had   it   only   four   months .   don   t   buy   it .
defective   hair   dryer   2   weeks   after   i   ordered   this   hairdryer   it   stopped   blowing   hot   air .   it   also   is   much   heavier   than   most   hairdryers ,   and ,   when   it   was   working ,   i   really   didn   t   notice   a   big   difference   between   this   hairdryer   and   regular   non   ionic   ,   less   expensive   dryers .
don   t   waste   your   money   i   had   wanted   a   hair   dryer   for   xmas   which   i   got .   i   was   so   happy   that   way   i   didn   t   have   to   be   under   a   hooded   hair   dryer .   well   every   time   i   have   used   it   and   it   s   not   many ,   i   put   the   hair   dryer   on   medium   heat   and   it   will   be   okay   for   a   couple   of   minutes ,   5   minutes   and   automatically   shut   off .   what   the   hell .   now   i   have   curlers   in   my   hair   and   this   thing   decides   to   shut   off   when   it   feels   like .   this   is   going   straight   back   to   the   store .   this   is   the   worst   hair   dryer .   br   signed   wet   hair .
good   ...   and   not   so   good   pros   br   1 .   this   blow   dryer   is   great   for   the   price .   just   don   t   expect   a   100   ionic   dryer .   you   get   a   nice   18   dryer   for   18   simple .   br   2 .   nice   looking ,   sleek   design ,   with   retractable   cord .   this   is   not   a   compact   dryer   for   travel   it   should   be   considered   more   of   a   mid   size .   br   br   cons   br   1 .   retractable   cord   is   quite   short ,   which   could   be   a   problem   if   your   outlet   is   not   very   close   by .   br   2 .   very   loud !   i   saw   others   complain   about   this ,   and   now   i   know   what   they   mean .   it   s   loud .   br   3 .   the   retractable   cord   failed   to   retract   after   a   couple   of   uses .   this   is   disappointing   considering   it   was   a   major   factor   in   my   purchase .   br   br   bottom   line   br   does   it   dry   hair   quickly   and   make   it   smooth   and   silky   no   more   than   any   other   dryer .   it   s   a   nice ,   inexpensive ,   blow   dryer ,   but   i   personally   would   not   purchase   it   again .   br  
order   a   bio   ionic   instead   i   was   going   to   order   a   t3   from   amazon   but   after   reading   the   reviews   that   the   manufacturer   would   not   honor   the   warranty   i   ordered   a   bio   ionic   whisper   light   from   amazon   for   173 .   works   great   and   because   my   wife   and   daughter   fight   over   it   i   bought   another   one .   it   has   a   5   year   warranty   that   will   be   honored .   if   t3   wants   to   loose   out   on   amazon   sales   by   being   jerks   about   the   warranty ,   let   them .
get   the   warrenty   i   purchased   one   of   these   hair   dryers   and   i   love   what   it   does   for   my   hair .   the   difference   between   the   t3   and   my   remington   is   a   salon   quality   blow   out   and   my   worst   hair   day .   only   problem ,   a   year   after   i   bought   it ,   it   quit   working .   i   may   have   gotten   a   knockoff .   since   i   couldn   t   register   it ,   i   m   screwed   on   the   warranty   and   have   to   buy   a   new   one .   i   believe   i   probably   got   a   defective   one   but   for   50   more ,   buy   one   from   sephora   where   you   can   register   it .   it   s   worth   it ! ! ! !
lovely   sleek   design   very   nice ,   sleek   design .   i   just   got   it ,   haven   t   used   it   yet   but   the   design   itself   makes   it   one   of   the   best   ones   out   there ,   if   not   the   best .   the   only   thing   that   it   is   missing   a   folding   handle .
my   third   one ....... each   one   lasted   a   year   a   half   first   of   all   ,   let   me   be   clear   that   the   materials   used   in   this   dryer   are   not   first   quality .... on   the   other   hand   the   design   is   extraordinary ....... i   use   mine   on   a   daily   basis   and   ,   provided   you   use   them   with   extra   care   they   will   last   more   than   a   year ...... repairable   ...... dont   think   about   it   . if   you   open   the   folding   handle ,   it   will   break   apart   in   your   hands ....... i   believe   its   components   are   so   cheap   that   they   do   not   resist   being   taken   apart ..... this   product   has   been   since   the   begining   assembled   in   south   america ,   just   to   seek   the   cheapest   manufacturing   process .
great   air   flow   but   too   loud !   the   retractable   cord   is   wonderful .   the   air   power   is   good   and   it   does   a   nice   job   drying   your   hair .   as   mentioned   by   others ,   it   is   heavy .   the   handle   is   also   clumsy   to   hold ,   especially   for   someone   with   small   hands .   br   br   my   main   objection   is   that   it   is   much   too   loud   and   for   that   reason   alone   i   would   not   buy   it   again .
great   until   it   stopped   working   after   4   months   loved   the   lightweight   and   compactible   dryer   until   stopped   working   about   4   months   after   purchase   date .   it   would   stop   in   the   middle   of   drying   my   hair   and   then   go   on   and   off   every   few   seconds .   very   annoying .   i   will   not   buy   another .
not   as   quiet   as   i   wanted   this   was   a   fine   dryer ,   but   i   returned   it .   it   simply   wasn   t   as   quiet   as   i   hoped .   i   ended   up   going   to   a   drugstore   in   town   and   plugging   in   all   the   dryers .   the   one   i   purchased   was   also   ionic ,   but   much   quieter   owing   to   the   fact   that   it   had   three   speeds   and   two   heat   settings .   that   means   i   can   keep   the   middle   speed   and   the   cold   heat   setting ,   and   it   s   much   quieter   than   other   dryers   i   tried .
fast   and   quiet   i   have   enjoyed   my   t3   dryer ,   and   so   far   has   lived   up   to   being   very   quiet   and   fast   drying .   was   disappointed   to   find   out   that   t3   would   not   accept   the   serial   number   for   registration ,   as   it   was   not   legitimate .   so   i   don   t   know   if   my   dryer   is   a   fake   or   not .....
no   warranty   i   can   t   say   that   i   have   any   complaints   about   the   way   this   product   works .   my   expectations   have   been   met .   however ,   i   was   very   disappointed   that   they   would   not   honor   the   warranty   because   they   said   that   amazon   is   not   an   authorized   seller .   when   i   paid   160.00   for   a   hair   dryer ,   i   hoped   i   could   get   a   warranty .
great   until ...   i   have   very   thick   hair   that   s   hard   to   dry .   this   blow   dryer   dries   my   hair   quickly   and   i   loved   the   retractable   cord .   it   was   a   great   blow   dryer   till   it   stopped   working   3   months   after   i   bought   it .   now   what  
works   for   me   good   price   for   perfectly   functioning   hair   dryer   ions   seem   to   control   frizziness   somewhat
works   great   but   i   m   a   bit   nervous ...   i   m   nervous   because   even   though   this   hair   dryer   dried   my   hair   faster   you   should   blot   before   using   it   though   ,   better   and   softer   than   the   typical   one   that   i   d   been   using ,   other   reviewers   have   mentioned   their   ones   shutting   off   and   overheating ,   and   i   m   wondering   how   long   mine   will   last .   but   i   ll   buy   another   one ,   should   mine   act   up .
great   hair   dryer   this   hair   dryer   really   dose   make   your   hair   softer ,   i   have   had   it   a   month   now   and   i   use   it   only   if   i   have   wet   hair   before   bed   or   going   out   and   it   only   takes   about   5   min   to   dry   my   hair   my   older   one   took   30   i   highly   recimend   it .
what   a   scam !   ordered   this   product   without   reading   other   reviews   first .   wish   i   had   because   these   ladies   are   dead   on .   the   dryer   cuts   off   as   soon   as   it   starts   to   get   hot .   don   t   waste   your   time   or   money .   it   s   saturday .   my   hair   is   wet   and   set ,   and   i   m   left   without   a   dryer .   i   ve   tried   three   times   twice   on   high   and   once   on   medium   setting .   i   m   sending   this   back   right   away .   amazon   don   t   let   conair   blame   this   on   you .   this   model   is   defective !
best   hairdryer   we   have   ever   had ...   forget   about   the   price ,   this   hairdryer   would   be   great   at   three   times   the   price .   light   weight ,   quiet   and   all   the   options   you   need .
exceptional   value   exceptional   dryer   this   is   an   exceptional   value   for   an   exceptional   dryer .   i   have   paid   alot   more   for   more   well   known ,   brand   named   dryers .   i   have   long   thick   hair   and   this   product   dries   my   hair   in   half   the   time   other   dryers   have   done   in   the   past .   buy   this   hair   dryer ,   you   won   t   be   sorry .
not   that   quiet ,   but   gets   the   job   done !   good   product   if   you   keep   the   setting   on   low   it   is   pretty   quiet ,   however   once   you   kick   it   into   that   high   gear ,   the   noise   level   increases   significantly .   no   complaints   though ,   dries   hair   well .
andis   33700   wall   mont   hair   dryer   this   item   was   shipped   on   time ,   easy   to   track   and   works   great .   been   very   pleased   with   this   item
not   that   great   i   bought   this   dryer   to   replace   my   10   year   old   conair ,   when   it   gets   hot   it   would   stop .   good   thing   i   didn   t   throw   it   away .   this   cordkeeper   only   worked   for   about   4   months .   it   is   also   very   loud !   almost   hurt   my   ears   to   use   it
i   like   it   this   is   a   good   product ,   especially   for   the   price   quite   powerful ,   i   like   the   folding   handle   and   retractable   cord   and   it   doesn   t   eat   my   hair .   my   only   complaint   is   it   has   shut   off   once   or   twice   on   its   own .   it   came   back   on   after   a   minute ,   but   it   makes   me   wonder   about   its   longevity .
okay   it   s   good   for   the   value   but   bonnet   pulls   with   the   weight   of   the   hose   and   drying   time   is   not   as   fast   as   with   an   upright   dryer .
softest   hair   ever !   i   have   thick ,   not   coarse ,   but   not   silky   hair .   i   rarely   blow   dry   my   hair   since   it   takes   so   long   maybe   7   10   minutes   with   my   old   hair   dryer ,   and   i   thought   it   made   my   hair   coarser .   i   decided   to   give   the   ion   thing   a   try   though ,   and   it   was   the   best   investment   in   time   ever .   it   only   takes   two   or   three   minutes   on   high   speed ,   medium   heat   to   dry   an   entire   head   of   shoulder   length   hair !   i   don   t   blow   until   it   s   bone   dry ,   just   dry   to   the   touch .   after   the   first   time ,   my   hair   was   super   soft .   after   the   second   time ,   it   got   even   softer   and   i   thought   it   had   more   body   too .   i   ve   only   had   it   a   week ,   so   we   ll   see   how   it   holds   up ,   but   the   ions   really   do   work .   i   ll   probably   never   air   dry   again !
great   hairdryer   this   hairdryer   works   exceptionally   well ,   and   dries   my   hair   in   about   half   the   time   10   minutes   .   the   only   downside   is   that   it   is   noticeably   heavier   than   a   regular   dryer .
great   hair   dryer   for   an   uncluttered   bathroom   well ,   i   finally   got   tired   of   the   clutter   associated   with   my   wife   s   hair   dryer   on   the   bathroom   counter   and   started   looking   for   wall   mounted   units .   at   the   time ,   the   jerdon   1600w   had   all   good   reviews   and   was   one   of   the   least   expensive   options .   we   liked   its   clean   and   symmetric   design   better   than   its   competitors .   anyhow ,   after   6   weeks   of   daily   use ,   it   still   works   fine   according   to   my   wife .   it   has   plenty   of   power   and   does   have   a   switch   on   the   handle   for   off   low   med   high .   if   it   is   on   when   you   try   to   hang   it   onto   the   wall   base ,   it   automatically   flips   the   switch   to   the   off   position .   most   importantly   to   me   the   bathroom   looks   clean   and   uncluttered   and   i   can   use   the   countertop   once   again .   the   only   thing   that   seems   a   little   strange   in   my   home   bathroom   rather   than   a   hotel   is   that   first   class   is   printed   on   the   handle   as   can   be   seen   in   the   photo   .
awesome !   this   is   one   of   the   best   blow   dryers   i   ve   ever   owned .   it   dries   your   hair   quickly ,   and   leaves   it   feeling   soft   not   dried   out .   i   almost   didn   t   purchase   it   because   of   the   price ,   but   i   m   glad   i   did .   you   get   what   you   pay   for ,   and   this   is   a   great   blow   dryer .
good   dryer   all   in   all ,   it   s   a   good   little   hair   dryer .   it   doesn   t   blow   as   hot   as   my   older   dryers ,   but   it   dries   my   hair   fast   and   with   less   sweating   on   my   part ! !   the   retractable   cord   is   kind   of   sluggish   doesn   t   retract   all   the   way .   but   it   s   still   an   improvement   over   regular   cords   that   were   always   getting   tangled   up   with   my   curling   iron   cord .   the   folding   handle   definitely   makes   it   easier   to   pack .   i   m   not   real   sure   if   i   notice   much   difference   with   frizz .   maybe   a   little   better .   the   only   negative   comment   i   can   make   is   that   it   s   very   loud !
what   happened   to   great   jerdon   1600w   dryer   i   owned   a   jerdon   1600w   wall   mount   dryer   for   4   years   till   it   finally   died   of   every   day   normal   usage .   i   then   bought   this   16.99   model   from   amazon   that   was   received   doa .   my   replacement   dryer   from   amazon   lasted   only   one   week   till   it   went   pop   and   smoked   in   my   hand !   amazon   won   t   send   a   third   replacement   but   they   did   refund   my   credit   card .   i   don   t   know   if   the   other   jerdon   1600w   dryer   that   amazon   sells   at   34.95   is   any   better   .
it   broke !   this   hair   dryer   worked   well   for   a   few   weeks ,   and   i   was   impressed   with   the   speed   i   could   dry   my   hair   and   the   softness   from   the   ionic   stuff .   however ,   after   a   few   weeks   of   use   it   broke .   it   over   heated   and   then   the   off   switch   wouldn   t   work ,   so   whenever   it   was   plugged   in ,   it   was   on !   very   disappointed ,   as   i   was   enjoying   my   new   dryer !
try   a   different   dryer   i   purchased   this   dryer   in   july   of   2005 .   on   feb   1   of   2006   this   dryer   sent   out   sparks   and   the   coils   inside   were   red   hot .   i   used   this   once   a   day   almost   every   day .   i   will   not   be   buying   another   jerdon   hair   dryer .
great   little   hair   dryer   this   is   a   great   little   hair   dryer .   i   have   one   in   each   bathroom .   it   is   compact ,   powerfull   and   out   of   the   way .
piece   of   junk   this   product   is   a   nightmare !   the   bonnet   refused   to   completely   fill   with   air   and   the   hose   is   stiff   and   not   long   enough .   the   bonnet   is   also   made   of   tissue   thin   plastic   and   if   the   unit   would   work   correctly ,   the   bonnet   would   most   likely   not   even   last   a   year   s   worth   of   use .   i   patched   the   hose   on   my   23   year   old   general   electric   hair   dryer   which   is   still   working   and   decided   to   deep   six   the   piece   of   junk !   save   your   money   and   don   t   buy   this   product !
great   item !   i   have   used   ionic   hairdryers   for   the   last   couple   of   years .   ionic   dryers   do   dryer   faster ,   and   with   less   heat   so   they   are   easier   on   your   hair .   this   was   the   first   one   i   have   seen   with   a   retractable   cord ,   which   is   what   first   attracted   me .   be   careful   not   to   pull   the   cord   out   to   far   or   it   doesn   t   retract   well .   br   br   over   all   this   is   a   great   little   dryer ,   at   a   great   price .   i   say   two   very   enthusiastic   thumbs   up !
what   a   rip   off   seemed   to   work   ok   at   first   although   i   didn   t   notice   much   improvment   in   speed   of   drying .   it   is   lightweight   and   easy   to   handle   but   it   is   hotter   than   i   m   used   to .   after   6   months ,   my   hair   started   to   feel   dry   and   had   zero   shine .   my   hair   had   always   been   very   healthy   and   shiny   before .   my   hair   stylist   noticed   it   and   couldn   t   figure   out   what   was   wrong .   after   about   9   months ,   i   switched   back   to   my   old   hairdryer   and   my   hair   was   instantly   healthy   and   shiny   again .   maybe   this   hairdryer   is   good   for   some   people   but   it   was   bad   for   me ,   and   costly !
if   it   ain   t   broke   don   t   fix   it ,   why   did   they   change   this   product   i   have   been   a   long   time   user   and   fan   of   the   conair   cord   keeper   hairdryers .   i   use   them   until   they   just   die .   recently   conair   changed   the   look   of   this   hairdryer   and   at   first   sight   i   thought   that   it   felt   much   more   flimsy   than   my   previous   cord   keepers   but   did   not   give   it   much   thought   since   i   have   always   been   very   pleased   with   this   hairdryer .   the   hairdryer   lasted   about   2   weeks   before   the   folding   handle   cracked .   when   we   opened   up   the   handle   we   found   that   the   plastic   piece   that   makes   the   handle   fold   was   cracked   in   half   and   did   not   appear   repairable .   i   went   out   and   purchased   another   cord   keeper   thinking   that   i   just   had   a   lemon   ,   well   the   second   one   lasted   exactly   3   months   and   1   day .   today   i   pulled   out   the   hairdryer ,   opened   the   handle   and   heard   a   crack .   this   handle   is   also   broken   which   prevents   the   hairdryer   from   staying   in   the   open   position .   the   product   does   have   a   2   yr   warranty   but   you   are   required   to   ship   the   defective   product   to   a   conair   service   center   along   with   3   for   shipping   and   handling   this   would   cost   me   more   than   the   hairdryer ,   just   not   worth   my   time   to   box   it   up   and   take   it   to   the   post   office !   br   br   that   being   said ,   when   this   hairdryer   worked   it   was   wonderful .   the   two   speed   settings   are   the   perfect   speeds ,   the   hairdryer   is   extremely   light   and   the   handle   is   easy   to   grip .   the   retractable   cord   is   the   best   feature   of   this   hairdryer   and   along   with   the   folding   handle   it   is   great   for   travel .   br   br   i   did   write   to   conair   and   their   response   will   determine   if   i   purchase   another   conair   hairdryer   plus   i   will   be   back   to   update   this   review .
amazon . com   is   not   an   authorized   dealer   t3   won   t   give   warranty   coverage   i   like   the   product .   however ,   having   purchased   it   from   amazon . com ,   t3   will   not   allow   me   to   register   my   product   for   future   warranty   because   they   claim   amazon . com   is   not   an   authorized   dealer .   for   such   an   expensive   every   day   product ,   a   warranty   would   be   nice   to   have   in   case   anything   were   to   go   wrong .   i   received   an   email   from   t3   and   a   call   back   both   confirming   that   they   do   not   consider   amazon . com   an   authorized   dealer .   when   i   called   amazon ,   they   had   never   heard   of   such   a   thing .   amazon . com   offered   to   exchange   my   featherweight   tourmaline   dryer   with   another   but   that   did   not   resolve   my   issue .   i   cannot   get   my   t3   tourmaline   featherweight   83808   hair   dryer   covered   by   t3   s   warranty   because   it   was   purchased   through   amazon . com .
wow ,   what   else   can   i   say   i   was   very   skeptical   of   spending   so   much   on   a   hair   dryer .   after   reading   the   great   reviews ,   i   figured   i   would   give   it   a   try   and   hope   for   the   best .   i   was   so   eager   to   try   it   this   morning   that   i   didn   t   even   let   my   hair   partially   air   dry   like   i   normally   do ! !   i   have   never   timed   how   long   it   takes   to   dry   my   hair   as   i   take   my   time ,   do   part ,   get   tired   and   come   back   to   it ,   etc .   my   hair   is   super   thick   and   longish   past   my   shoulders   by   a   few   inches .   so ,   i   start   to   dry   my   hair   and   not   only   did   it   seem   that   it   dried   much   faster ,   but   i   was   able   to   get   it   so   much   straighter   than   with   my   cheapo   ionic   dryer   that   i   had   been   using   previously .   i   usually   dry   as   well   as   i   can   and   then   have   to   spend   another   10   minutes   with   the   iron   to   smooth   out   the   mess .   i   only   used   the   iron   for   a   small   section   in   the   back   that   i   hadn   t   hit   well   enough   with   the   dryer .   my   husband   even   commented   that   my   hair   looked   pretty   today   i   didn   t   tell   him   i   bought   a   new   dryer ! ! ! !  
tough   on   my   cat ,   but   great   on   hair !   i   bought   this   when   my   conair   travel   dryer   finally   gave   up   after   nearly   a   decade .   i   purchased   this   specific   dryer   because   of   the   retractable   cord ,   and   love   it !   the   added   benefit   is   that   it   dries   my   hair   so   quickly ,   but   it   was   the   cord   feature   that   sold   me .   warning   as   the   previous   reviewer   mentioned ,   cats   don   t   like   this   dryer .   when   the   cord   retracts   it   must   sound   like   the   retracting   cord   on   my   vacuum   cleaner   because   my   13   year   old   cat   flies   off   the   bathroom   counter   as   soon   as   i   pull   the   cord   to   plug   it   in .   otherwise ,   it   s   a   great   little   dryer .
spanish   curls   gone   straight !   it   really   works !   i   bought   this   dryer   to   replace   another   professional   dryer   i   had .   i   was   so   surprised   at   how   light   and   quiet   it   is !   when   i   first   opened   the   box ,   i   didnt   think   it   was   going   to   work   as   well   as   it   claimed   because   it   felt   like   a   toy .   but ,   i   am   very   pleased   with   the   results .   it   dries   my   hair   faster ,   my   arm   doesnt   get   tired   because   its   so   light ,   i   can   still   hear   my   house   phone   ring   because   its   so   quiet ,   and   it   stays   cool   to   the   touch   so   you   wont   burn   yourself .   it   will   even   straighten   dry   hair   for   those   mornings   when   you   need   a   touch   up .   my   whole   curly   haired   family   has   tryed   the   tourmaline   and   loved   it !
quieter   hair   dryer   when   my   toddler   is   sick   with   a   cold ,   i   don   t   want   him   to   go   to   bed   after   his   bath   with   towel   dried ,   damp   hair   but   he   was   afraid   of   our   regular   hair   dryer .   he   is   definitely   less   afraid   of   this   one   which   is   a   huge   plus .   i   use   it   myself   and   find   that   it   doesn   t   take   me   any   longer   to   dry   my   hair   than   usual .   i   also   like   that   it   is   lightweight .   i   can   t   compare   it   to   other   hair   dryers   that   claim   to   be   super   quiet .   however ,   i   would   say   that   is   misleading .   it   is   not   super   quiet ,   but   it   is   more   quiet   than   our   regular   hair   dryer .   a   negative   for   me   is   the   placement   of   the   control   setting   buttons .   they   are   right   where   i   place   my   fingers   to   grip   the   base   of   the   dryer   and   because   the   switch   sort   of   softly   rolls   up   down   to   change   from   both   high   medium   low   and   from   cool   warm   hot ,   i   often   unintentionally   switch   from   hot   to   cold .   i   had   to   concentrate   to   hold   my   fingers   away   from   the   switches ,   away   from   where   they   would   naturally   rest .   this   hair   dryer   s   switches   should   be   made   in   such   a   way   that   they   do   not   change   so   easily .   a   more   gear   like   switch   that   firmly   clicks   and   stays   into   separate   positions   might   have   solved   this   design   problem .
great   hair   dryer   i   was   a   little   hesitant   to   spend   so   much   money   on   a   blow   dryer   and   then   have   it   not   live   up   to   its   claims ,   but   i   have   to   say   i   am   delighted !   my   long ,   curly   hair   was   dry   in   7   minutes ,   and   was   soft   and   not   frizzy ! !
great   dryer   i   just   got   this   dryer   for   christmas ,   and   i   absolutely   love   it !   my   hair   has   zero   static ,   which   is   unusual   during   the   winter .   usually   it   takes   about   15   minutes ,   at   the   minimum ,   to   dry   my   hair ,   but   with   this   dryer ,   it   only   took   5   minutes !   i   would   buy   this   dryer   for   everyone   i   know !
quiet ,   heavy ,   and   a   long   barrel   for   shorter   arms   i   was   interested   in   the   conair   ion   shine   hairdryer   as   a   means   to   keep   my   hair   healthier ,   plus ,   my   older   conair   dryer   needed   to   be   replaced .   since   i   have   owned   the   ion   shine   in   the   last   6   months   i   ve   noticed   that   much   more   of   my   hair   is   breaking   off   near   the   scalp   and   i   have   a   real   problem   with   dryness   and   lack   of   body .   i   haven   t   changed   any   other   hair   products .   the   position   of   the   ion   switch   is   also   a   concern .   i   am   a   short   lady   so   the   weight   of   the   dryer   and   the   length   of   the   barrel   with   the   attachment   is   a   problem   as   well .   the   dryer   seems   to   run   either   too   hot ,   or   on   warm   is   too   cool   to   dry   my   fine   hair   in   under   5   7   minutes .   this   is   too   long   for   me   on   work   mornings .
never   going   back   i   used   this   hair   dryer   at   my   friends   place   and   fell   in   love .   i   showed   up   at   sephora   expecting   to   pay   50   and   saw   that   it   was   well   over   200 .   i   bit   the   bullet   and   purchased   it   anyway   and   it   s   worth   every   penny .   my   hair   has   never   been   softer   or   shinier .   in   fact ,   it   s   improved   over   just   towel   drying .   yes ,   it   dries   faster   and   is   lighter ,   but   as   a   male   this   was   a   less   critical   issue .   i   really   love   how   it   leaves   my   hair   soft ,   easily   manageable   no   static   ,   and   healthy .   last   week   i   bought   one   for   my   mom   and   more   people   are   getting   them   for   christmas .
the   best   hairdryer   ever ! !   i   have   curly   hair   that   i   always   blow   dry   straight .   i   have   paid   300   for   hairdryers   bought   in   beauty   supply   stores ... they   were   so   heavy   and   loud .   i   was   very   skeptical   to   spend   more   money   on   yet   another   dryer ,   i   am   so   glad   i   finally   did !   br   this   dryer   is   magic .   my   drying   time   went   from   45min   to   15   no   joke .   my   arm   never   hurts   anymore   and   i   am   never   getting   too   hot .   br   i   have   0   frizz   and   it   really   does   make   hair   shinny .   it   looks   a   lot   better   after   15min   now   than   it   ever   did   with   my   old   45min   drying   time .   i   get   compliments   on   my   hair   all   the   time ...   br   i   rarely   write   reviews ,   but   i   had   to   get   the   word   out   on   this   exceptional   dryer .   buy   it ! !  
owned   two   both   died   when   i   first   saw   this   model   i   was   excited   about   the   practicality   of   it   s   wall   mount   design ,   and   the   sleek   styling   it   offered .   it   s   1600   watts   supplied   ample   drying   power ,   and   the   unit   even   has   the   ability   to   be   shut   off   from   the   handset ...   a   feature   i   am   very   fond   of !   the   problem   they   don   t   last !   my   first   one   lasted   about   9   months   and   then   began   to   continually   overheat   and   shut   off   several   times   during   my   styling   process .   blowing   into   the   back   got   old   pretty   quick ,   and   in   the   hope   that   i   just   got   that   one   lemon ,   i   decided   to   order   another .   i   ve   owed   my   present   unit   for   not   quite   a   year   now ,   and   a   few   days   ago   i   went   to   turn   it   on ,   and   it   just   wouldn   t .   terminal .   i   find   myself   again   in   need   of   a   new   wall   mounted   hair   dryer ,   dreading   removing   this   one   and   remounting   the   next .   i   m   presently   seeking   a   better   made   model ,   after   all ,   if   you   re   going   to   mount   something   on   your   wall ,   you   want   it   to   last   more   than   a   year ,   no  
super   fast ! !   love   this   hair   dryer .   my   hair   used   to   take   forever   to   dry   and   this   does   the   job   in   half   the   time   if   not   less .   my   hair   always   feels   nice   and   soft   after   i   am   finished   drying   it   and   is   not   frizzy .   a   huge   improvement   over   my   20   hairdryer   from   target .
the   best !   great   blowdryer ! !   i   bought   this   for   my   master   bath   since   i   was   redecorating .   lots   of   power   and   heat   for   a   1600   watt .   the   wall   mount   is   absolutely   terrific   feel   like   i   m   in   a   hotel   bathroom   .   the   night   light   is   green   and   some   may   not   like   this   but   it   fits   in   with   my   decor   so   i   like   it .   can   t   wait   to   get   another   one   when   i   re   do   main   bathroom .
great   hair   dryer   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   for   my   wife   who   told   me   that   she   read   it   was   a   really   great   hair   dryer   and   she   wanted   one .   well ,   i   have   used   it   twice   myself   and ,   yes ,   it   really   is   a   great   hair   dryer .   she   uses   it   to   straighten   her   curly   hair   and   it   does   a   terrific   job ,   making   it   soft   and   frizz   free .   in   that   i   have   curly   hair   also ,   i   decided   to   try   it   and   was   surprised   when   it   also   straightened   my   hair .   we   have   purchased   other   expensive   hair   dryers   and   this   one   is   far   and   away   the   best .   i   highly   recommend   it .
wall   mount   having   a   wall   mounted   hairdryer   is   great .   it   keeeps   the   counter   top   clear   of   clutter ,   and   you   don   t   have   to   unplug   it   and   put   it   away   each   time .   it   has   plenty   of   power ,   at   least   for   my   thin   hair .   i   have   to   run   it   in   the   2nd   setting ,   as   the   third   setting   is   a   little   to   hot .
very   light   dries   fast   but   other   claims   exaggerated   i   first   saw   this   hair   dryer   on   a   tv   show   talking   about   beauty   products   used   by   the   stars .   then   i   noticed   my   hairdresser   had   switched   to   this   brand .   his   observations   were   the   same   as   mine .   if   you   take   a   lot   of   time   drying   hair   and   the   weight   of   the   dryer   is   an   issue ,   this   is   a   very   good   purchase .   but   your   hair   will   be   no   shinier   or   softer   than   with   other   dryers .
great   hair   dryer   owned   one   for   years .   paid   twice   this   price   for   my   old   one .   needed   2   more   for   second   home .   had   to   order   one   for   a   friend   after   she   saw   my   old   one .   keeps   dryer   always   accessable .   never   in   the   way   since   it   has   it   s   own   place .   ordered   3   this   time .
great   product   and   the   only   ceramic ,   ionic   blow   dryer   with   a   retractable   cord   this   is   the   only   ceramic ,   ionic   blow   dryer   with   a   retractable   cord   that   i   could   find   on   the   market   and   i   am   very   pleased   with   it .   my   fiance   loves   it   because   the   cord   doesn   t   get   tangled   or   clutter   up   the   bathroom   counter .   i   love   it   because   it   s   a   great   size   and   performs   well   drying   hair   very   quickly .   the   only   reason   i   hesitated   from   giving   it   5   stars   is   that   it   is   a   bit   heavy   because   of   the   ceramic   core ,   i   suppose   .   lastly   i   think   the   product   could   be   improved   with   a   more   ergonomic   handle .
conair   sb1   wife   s   comments   received   the   product   in   very   good   time .   price   was   quite   attractive .   there   aren   t   many   old   fashioned   bonnet   hair   dryers   around   anymore .   this   one   replaces   a   decades   old   ge   unit   that   developed   severe   rattles   and   then   terminal   switch   failure .   br   br   my   wife   really   likes   the   compact   size ,   relatively   low   noise ,   comfort   of   the   product   and   storage   of   the   tube   and   bonnet   inside   the   unit   s   case .   i   d   give   the   style   designer   a   big   attaboy .   the   unit   is   much   easier   to   store   away   than   the   old   one .   br   br   the   only   negative   comment   was   that   she   wishes   the   unit   had   one   more   lower   heat   option   she   gets   pretty   warm   even   at   low   heat .   however ,   she   may   be   happier   when   our   good   old   wisconsin   winter   setles   in   and   the   house   is   a   little   cooler .
another   great   revlon   product   my   10   year   old   revlon   drier   still   works ,   but   has   seen   better   days .   i   checked   them   all   out   and   decided   to   stick   with   revlon   because   i   love   my   old   travel   blowdryer .   i   was   not   disappointed .   i   ve   had   it   for   almost   a   month   now   and   i   love   it .   i   have   long ,   very   thick ,   and   sometimes   unruly   hair .   i   live   in   south   florida ,   and   this   dryer   works   super   fast   and   makes   my   hair   look   silky   smooth .   thanks   revlon !
okay   performance   better   than   average   equipment   longevity   unlike   many   other   reviewers   here ,   i   have   exceptionally   thin   hair .   i   purchased   this   dryer   with   the   intent   to   improve   the   condition .   it   does   a   fair   job .   i   have   had   the   dryer   about   2   years   and   it   hold   up   rather   well   considering   the   abuse   i   give   it .   the   dryer   has   very   little   power   and   i   would   say   that   drying   time   probably   takes   about   2   3   minutes   longer   than   with   a   regular   blow   dryer .   if   you   have   very   frizzy   or   curly   hair   then   you   i   probably   would   not   recommend   this   just   based   on   the   power   levels .   if   you   have   wavy   hair   then   this   dryer   in   combination   with   either   a   diffuser   or   the   accompanying   attachment   should   would   well   for   you .   it   is   a   heavier   hair   dryer   and   isn   t   great   to   take   on   vacations .   the   position   of   the   ion   switch   is   lousy   you   ll   probably   find   yourself   accidentally   turning   it   off   just   based   on   it   s   location .   settings   are   either   high   or   low   and   the   same   goes   for   speed .   i   happen   to   use   high   but   if   you   like   variety   you   may   want   to   consider   another   model .   a   better   buy   is   the   revlon   ion   dryer   if   you   feel   like   upgrading .   the   difference   in   price   is   perhaps   5   u . s .   dollars   at   best ....
it   s   worth   the   !   this   is   an   expensive   hairdryer ,   but   it   dried   my   hair   faster   than   a   conventional   dryer .   for   someone   who   blowdries   her   hair   every   day ,   that   alone   makes   it   worth   the   ,   but   it   also   made   my   hair   smoother .   also ,   there   s   a   4   year   warranty ,   so   there   s   no   risk .   i   would   highly   recommend   this   product .
the   best   blow   dryer   ever   i   never   knew   how   different   a   blow   dryer   could   be   until   a   friend   of   mine   came   over   with   this   dryer   and   i   could   not   believe   how   good   my   hair   felt   afterwards .   i   ended   up   buying   the   thing   that   night   and   threw   that   other   conair   one   out .   bought   an   extra   travel   one   that   week   too  
very   poor   product   i   wish   i   could   have   read   reviews   on   this   product   before   i   bought   it .   br   it   was   very   difficult   to   put   back   into   its   case .   br   i   only   used   it   a   few   times .   the   last   time   it   just   shut   off   and   never   would   start   again .   i   would   not   recommend   this   product .
defective   product   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   recently   and   was   totally   dissatisfied .   it   was   very   difficult   to   open   the   plastic   case   that   housed   the   bonnet   and   hose .   the   dryer   turned   itself   off   periodically   throughout   operation .   save   yourself   frustation   and   buy   a   more   expensive   model ! !
the   best !   this   blowdryer   is   simply   the   best .   its   cheap   and   it   works   so   well !   it   feels   like   a   bargain !   i   have   less   flyaways   and   my   hair   is   shinier !   my   hair   has   never   looked   so   good .   i   had   no   problems   with   the   switches   or   the   weight   of   the   dryer .   the   size   is   not   too   big   or   small   and   its   quiet .   all   in   all   it   is   the   best   blow   dryer   i   had   ever   used .   to   my   surprise ,   theres   an   ion   switch ,   so   you   can   have   it   on   or   off !   great   product .
overall   disappointed   everything   works   as   advertised ,   however ,   it   did   not   meet   my   expectations .   i   have   generally   been   very   pleased   with   conair   hair   dryers ,   and   the   ion   feature   seems   to   really   tame   the   frizz .   however ,   the   blower   on   this   model   is   very   slow ,   so   it   takes   a   long   time .   sometimes   i   have   to   pull   out   my   old   dryer   to   get   the   wet   out ,   then   use   this   one   to   finish   otherwise   it   would   take   me   20   minutes   to   dry   my   hair .   also ,   the   high   low   setting   is   for   the   blower   only ,   which   is   useless   since   high   is   so   slow   anyway .   the   heat   is   not   controlable ,   except   for   the   cold   button   you   have   to   hold   down   to   get   just   air .   as   other   reviewers   have   noted ,   the   buttons   are   terrible .   i   almost   can   t   hold   it   by   the   handle   without   turning   it   off .   occasionally   i   have   gotten   through   with   drying   and   realized   the   ion   feature   got   turned   off   how   annoying ,   especially   after   having   spent   20   minutes   drying   my   hair .
a   bit   disappointed   the   on   off   switch   on   this   dryer   needs   improvement .   i   find   myself   turning   the   dryer   off   constantly   while   using   it .
never   again ! ! ! !   i   bought   this   hair   dryer   a   couple   of   months   ago ,   and   now   it   isn   t   even   blowing   hot   air .   i   have   bought   conair   hair   dryers   before   and   never   will   again ,   just   because   of   my   past   two   bad   experiences .   i   didn   t   keep   the   receipt   which   is   my   own   fault ,   but   the   dryer   isn   t   even   six   months   old   and   wasn   t   exactly   the   most   inexpensive   dryer   in   the   store .   it   just   turned   me   off   when   it   quit   working .
new   shine   for   the   ol   mane   as   a   child   of   the   sixties ,   i   still   wear   my   hair   long   and   i   blow   it   dry   every   morning .   when   my   old   hartman   protech   1600   hair   dryer   hit   the   bathroom   floor ,   things   weren   t   the   same .   eventually ,   in   a   spectacular   pyrotechnic   display ,   it   breathed   its   last .   br   since   i   had   paid   20   bucks   for   it   way   back   when ,   i   was   ready   to   spend   that   much   on   a   replacement .   much   to   my   surprise ,   in   the   10   or   so   years   i   d   owned   that   dryer ,   a   lot   had   changed ,   and   now   the   same   money   buys   a   lot   more   hair   dryer ,   so   with   some   dough   to   spare ,   i   bought   one   of   these .   br   many   complain   that   it   doesn   t   pack   the   same   wallop   as   other   dryers   but   that   s   a   case   of   perception   versus   reality .   the   conair   s   barrel   has   a   larger   diameter   than   most   dryers   and   its   fan   is   quieter ,   so   while   the   perceptible   breeze   isn   t   as   blustery ,   it   s   still   moving   plenty   of   air .   i   know   because   i   use   an   egg   timer   to   count   off   3   minutes   while   i   dry   my   hair   and   the   conair   never   leaves   my   hair   damp   a   barber   told   me   that   after   3   minutes   of   blow   drying ,   you   re   just   toasting   your   hair   and   not   helping   it   .   if   you   must   have   that   scalp   scorching   pinpoint   blast ,   conair   includes   a   concentrator .   br   ions   are   all   the   rage   in   hair   dryer   technology   right   now .   purportedly ,   a   stream   of   ions   directed   at   your   hair   will   neutralize   static   electricity   and   smooth   out   frizzy   hair .   ions   are   also   claimed   to   flatten   out   scaly   hair   shafts ,   resulting   in   more   shine .   i   m   waiting   for   our   good   friends   at   consumer   reports   to   weigh   in   on   the   benefits   or   lack   thereof   of   dual   ion   ports ,   but   after   a   week   of   daily   use   with   the   ion   switch   on ,   i   ve   noticed   that   my   hair   doesn   t   fight   me   as   much   when   i   brush   it   into   place .   even   when   the   static   charged   santa   ana   winds   are   howling   through   sunny   socal ,   my   hair   doesn   t   stick   out   like   porcupine   quills .   and ,   yes ,   if   i   turn   my   head   from   side   to   side ,   there   s   a   noticeable   shimmer   that   either   wasn   t   there   before   or   i   had   never   noticed   it .   br   a   minor   flaw   is   that   the   power   and   ion   switches   respond   to   a   very   light   push ,   but   after   a   couple   uses   you   learn   to   position   your   hand   accordingly   after   switching   on   the   dryer .   the   dryer   offers   low   and   high   air   speed   heat   settings   and   has   a   cool   shot   button   that   cuts   off   the   heater   while   cranking   the   fan   up   to   its   fastest   speed .   cool   shot   is   another   feature   that   is   said   to   set   a   style   in   place   by   cooling   down   the   hair   quickly .   br   so ,   whether   ions   really   do   or   don   t   make   a   difference ,   the   overall   performance   of   the   conair   ion   shine   is   worth   the   price . ut   after   a   couple   uses   you   learn   to   position   your   hand   accordingly   after   switching   on   the   dryer .   the   dryer   offers   low   and   high   air   speed   heat   settings   and   has   a   cool   shot   button   that   cuts   off   the   heater   while   cranking   the   fan   up   to   its   fastest   speed .   cool   shot   is   another   feature   that   is   said   to   set   a   style   in   place   by   cooling   down   the   hair   quickly .   br   so ,   whether   ions   really   do   or   don   t   make   a   difference ,   the   overall   performance   of   the   conair   ion   shine   is   worth   the   price .
move   over   professional   hair   dryers   i   purchased   this   dryer   for   about   a   little   money   .   one   week   before   i   purchased   my   professional   solano   super   x   ssx   for   for   more   money   .   and   after   using   this   one   for   about   one   week ,   then   using   the   ssx   for   another ,   i   went   back   to   this   one   and   noticed   the   difference   in   my   hair   immediately .   my   hair   much   is   smoother ,   shinier   and   the   split   ends   lay   flat   with   the   revlon   ion .   my   hair   doesn   t   feel   like   it   s   parched   compared   to   when   i   use   the   ssx .   yes ,   it   s   not   an   expensive   professional   dryer   so   it   may   not   last   as   long   as   the   ssx   i   won   t   know   because   i   won   t   be   using   the   ssx   any   longer   but   it   makes   my   hair   look   100   better   after   it   s   dried   than   the   professional   dryer   does   and   it   s   a   much   quicker ,   healthier   dry   time .   i   receive   compliments   on   my   hair   when   i   have   used   the   revlon   ion   dryer ,   and   needless   to   say ,   no   compliments   on   my   hair   when   i   have   used   the   ssx .   buy   one ,   make   sure   to   leave   the   ion   setting   on   not   sure   why   you   would   not   want   to   ,   you   won   t   not   be   disappointed ! !
it   sucks !   i   just   bought   this   dryer   today   after   my   other   conair   stopped   working .   it   takes   sooooooo   long   for   me   to   dry   my   hair   now ... i   can   barely   even   feel   it !   it   messes   up   my   hair   more   than   my   other   one   did .   as   for   helping   my   hair ...... yeah   right .   same   ole   frizzies   as   always .   i   m   going   to   try   and   take   it   back .
my   ray   gun   i   love   this   dryer ,   it   is   sooo   quiet .   it   dries   my   thick   hair   quickly .   i   like   the   attachment   which   directs   the   airflow .   my   only   complaint   is   the   size   of   the   dryer .   it   is   a   bit   awkward ,   and   that   is   why   i   did   not   give   it   5   stars .   i   don   t   know   or   care   about   the   negative   ions ,   i   don   t   think   they   do   anything .   if   you   want   your   hair   dried   quickly ,   quietly ,   and   shiny ,   then   purchase   this   dryer .
wonderful ! ! !   i   thought   i   had   a   fairly   decent   blowdryer ... until   it   died .   now   i   m   glad   the   thing   is   gone .   my   hair   is   thick   and   has   always   taken   a   long   time   to   dry .   thank   you   revlon   for   cutting   my   drying   time   in   half .   my   hair   has   a   smoother   texture   and   is   much   softer   with   this   blowdryer .   since   i   started   using   it   people   have   been   commenting   on   how   nice   my   hair   looks .   i   was   skeptical   after   reading   the   online   reviews   but   after   reading   about   the   other   blowdryers   i   decided   to   give   it   a   try .   i   m   so   glad   i   did !
as   good   as   the   expensive   hair   dryers !   i   looked   at   this   hair   dryer   for   two   reasons   1   as   a   back   up   to   my   100   hair   dryer   my   salon   sells   and   2   something   i   could   keep   in   my   gym   bag .   i   have   long ,   naturally   curly ,   thick   hair   that   i   like   to   wear   very   straight   to   the   office .   both   my   expensive   hair   dryer   and   this   hair   dryer   get   my   hair   straight   and   very   smooth .   the   best   method   for   achieving   this   was   to   use   the   highest   heat   and   fastest   setting   on   wet   hair   until   the   hair   is   damp ,   then   to   finish   drying   my   hair   with   the   air   flow   nozzle   on   low   speed   and   medium   heat   while   using   a   rollerbrush   to   hold   the   hair   straight   and   curl   the   ends .   i   d   highly   recommend   this   hair   dryer .   one   thing   to   note   i   do   not   notice   any   difference   when   using   the   ion   switch   depends   on   hair   type   .   but   with   the   multiple   settings   and   the   air   flow   nozzle ,   this   is   a   great   product .   i   ve   had   this   hair   dryer   for   six   months   and   felt   compelled   to   write   because   most   commercial   stores   don   t   sell   quality   hair   dryers   like   this   one .
it   s   ok   i   read   these   reviews   and   thought   i   had   found   a   miracle   product .   i   have   medium   thick   hair ,   but   it   is   long ,   and   there   is   a   lot   of   it .   my   hair   is   usually   somewhat   frizzy   after   blow   drying .   i   have   used   the   ion   stylist   for   over   a   week   now ,   and   have   not   noticed   a   difference   in   drying   time .   i   have   noticed   a   slight   difference   in   the   texture   of   my   hair   after   drying ,   but   i   think   that   is   due   to   the   cool   function   on   the   dryer   better   than   most   cool   air   is   expended   almost   immediately   ,   rather   than   the   ion   feature .   the   real   test ,   however ,   will   be   this   summer   in   the   nyc   subways !   humidity .

great   product   for   curly   hair ! ! !   i   have   very   thick ,   curly   hair   and   recently   got   a   new ,   short   style   that   i   wanted   to   blow   straight .   i   had   an   older   dryer   that   just   didn   t   cut   it   so   i   did   some   research   and   purchased   this   one .   i   absolutely   love   it .   it   blows   my   hair   straight   very   fast   and   all   the   frizz   is   gone   too .
hope   it   works   i   just   bought   this   dryer   so   i   have   yet   to   use   it .   i   just   wanted   to   thank   all   the   ladies   for   their   reviews .   it   helped   me   choose   this   dryer .   i   have   been   using   the   conair   1875   translucent   blue   dryer   for   two   years .   i   had   to   buy   a   new   one   each   year   why   good   question ,   b   c   it   stops   working .   i   used   it   last   night ,   and   went   to   use   it   this   monring   and   ah   ha ,   it   doesn   t   work !   it   didn   t   fall   noone   else   uses   it   it   just   stoped !   i   was   going   to   but   the   conair   ion   blowdryer   but   after   reading   all   these   reviews   i   said   let   me   get   away   from   conair ,   the   dryer   never   did   anything ,   and   if   you   live   in   ny   you   know   what   the   seasons   are   like   here ,   i   have   long   thick   wavy   hair   that   i   dry   straight ,   so   i   m   hoping   this   dryer   really   does   work   i   ll   let   you   know ,   but   again   thanks   to   all   the   reviews   they   really   helped   in   making   my   purchase .
too   much   electricity   use   i   bought   this   hairdryer   to   get   the   benefit   of   the   ionic   hairdryer   less   damaging ,   faster   dry   time ,   etc   .   the   problems   i   had   with   the   hairdryer   were   1   the   silly   placement   of   the   on   off   button   it   s   right   where   you   have   your   hand ,   so   you   re   constantly   turning   it   off   ,   and   2   the   high   amount   of   electricity   it   uses .   it   kept   on   tripping   circuits   both   at   my   house   and   at   other   family   members   homes   over   the   holidays .   i   tried   to   find   another   ion   hairdryer   that   used   less   power   and   was   surprised   to   find   out   that   the   standard   for   hairdryers   now   is   1875   watts .   that   s   the   equivalent   of   over   30 ,   60   watt   lightbulbs !   i   did   manage   to   find   the   igia   ion   hairdryer   that   uses   only   1200   watts .   i   don   t   like   it   as   much   as   the   conair ,   but   at   least   i   m   not   running   downstairs   all   the   time   to   switch   the   circuit   breaker !
absolutely   manificent   i   was   a   little   skeptical   about   the   reviews   that   i   read .   i   had   doubts   of   how   a   blow   dryer   can   give   you   shine   and   reduce   freeze ,   and   what   was   this   ion   thing .   well ,   for   someone   who   has   two   left   hands   for   blow   drying   her   hair   this   blow   dryer   is   a   god   s   sent .   i   blew   dry   my   hair   with   this   brow   dryer   and   with   the   next   time   i   had   to   wash   my   hair   i   dried   it   with   my   old   blow   dryer .   for   someone   who   lives   in   miami ,   florida   and   where   humidity   is   1000   ,   this   blow   dryer   works   amazing .   the   blow   dryer   deliveries   what   it   promises .   my   hair   was   shinier   and   freeze   control .   bottom   line ,   i   highly   recommend   it .   it   is   definitely   money   well   spent .
versatile   .   br   powerful .   multi   speed ,   multi   temperature .   ionizer .   what   else   could   you   wish   great ! !
best   type   of   hair   dryer   out   there ! !   i   just   started   using   an   ionic   hairdryer   recently   after   my   cousin   requested   one   as   a   christmas   gift .   i   used   hers   once   and   i   was   hooked .   my   hair   is   long   mid   back   long   , wavy   and   usually   frizzy   if   i   don   t   use   straightening   products   or   a   blow   dryer   straightening   hair   attachment .   it   used   to   take   me   atleast   half   an   hour   to   completely   dry   my   hair   straight   on   a   regular   dryer   high   setting .   with   the   ionic   dryer   my   hair   without   any   balms ,   gels   or   attachments   is   super   shiny ,   has   lots   of   volume   and   dries   in   half   that   time   and   has   gotten   more   straighter !   there   is   an   even   better   newer   model   conair   ionshine   dryer   1875   that   has   a   more   ergonomic   handle   with   better   settings   and   buttons .   i   would   recommend   this   to   all   my   friends   and   family .
good   buy   one   of   the   main   reasons   why   i   selected   this   dryer   over   others   was   the   ion   setting   and   the   sleek   look   of   the   dryer .   it   gave   volume   and   shine   to   my   hair .   i   felt   the   buttons   on   the   dryer   to   be   slightly   awkward   because   they   can   be   easily   depressed   when   in   use .   there   is   really   no   heat   setting   but   with   the   addition   of   the   cool   shot ,   i   can   sort   of   control   the   heat .   the   high   low   buttons   is   just   the   speed .   my   mother ,   who   also   uses   it ,   felt   it   to   be   a   bit   large   and   heavy ,   but   i   didn   t   have   that   sort   of   problem ,   so   i   guess   if   you   are   a   bit   petite ,   you   might   want   something   smaller ,   other   than   that ,   i   think   it   s   great .
excellent !   perfect   for   my   thick   hair .   i   have   thick   shoulder   length   hair ,   that   usually   takes   35   40   minutes   to   dry .   with   this   dryer ,   i   m   done   in   20   minutes   and   my   hair   looks   smooth   and   soft .   i   was   skeptical   about   the   whole   ionizing   thing ,   but   it   has   made   a   big   difference   with   my   hair .   the   removable   br   filter   was   the   deciding   factor .   i   ve   thrown   away   dryers   just   because   i   couldn   t   clean   them .   excellent   product !
close   to   perfect   overall ,   i   am   extremely   pleased   with   this   hair   dryer .   it   did   improve   the   texture   of   my   hair .   my   hair   is   much   shinier   and   healthier   looking   than   the   results   from   my   old   dryer .   the   fly   away   hairs   are   minimized ,   which   is   great   news   during   a   wisconsin   winter .   it   was   not   quite   as   heat   intensive   as   my   previous   hair   dryer   also   a   revlon   product   ,   which   i   m   guessing   will   also   help   the   future   health   of   my   hair .   the   buttons   were   a   little   stiff   at   first   use ,   but   i   m   hoping   they   ll   loosen   up   with   more   use .   this   dryer   was   approximately   the   same   weight   as   my   previous   dryer .   it   was   slightly   less   noisy ,   but   at   a   different   pitch   it   seemed   a   little   higher   pitched   .   the   only   thing   that   prevents   me   from   giving   a   five   star   rating   is   that   it   seemed   to   take   a   little   longer   to   dry   my   hair   than   with   my   previous   dryer ,   which   was   the   same   wattage .   i   chose   this   product   over   the   conair   product   because   this   had   more   options   in   the   heat   air   level   settings .
great   hair !   i   just   purchased   this   dryer ,   and   i   really   like   the   way   my   hair   looks .   it   does   what   it   says ,   drys   it   in   much   shorter   time ,   and   a   much   healthier   feel ... my   head   isn   t   on   fire .   it   doesn   t   seem   like   hair   would   dry   as   fast   as   it   does ... but   it   works !
disappointment   with   dryer   i   purchased   it   because   it   was   supposed   to   be   quiet .   it   s   every   bit   as   loud   as   my   old   dryer .   it   s   heavy ,   cumbersome ,   hard   to   manage .   i   kept   turning   it   off   because   of   the   location   of   the   buttons   on   the   handle   i   didn   t   have   that   problem   with   my   old   dryer   .   it   kept   sucking   my   hair   in   the   motor   area .   br   but ,   i   do   think   there   s   something   to   this   ion   thing .   my   hair   seemed   softer   and   straighter   no   frizzies .   it   also   seemed   to   dry   faster .   so ,   i   am   now   on   a   quest   to   find   a   ion   dryer   that   is   light ,   quiet   and   easy   to   manage   oh ,   and   doesn   t   eat   my   hair .
the   best   dryer ! ! !   i   love   this   dryer   not   only   is   it   quiet ,   it   really   does   make   my   hair   shiny   and   silky .   i   bought   this   because   i   simply   needed   a   dryer   and   thought   if   it   could   do   anything   else   it   would   just   be   a   bonus .   i   have   straight   hair   which   tends   to   be   more   shiney   than   layered ,   i   liked   how   my   hair   felt   particularly   here   where   it   can   be   extremely   humid .   i   was   pleasantly   surprised .   although   another   reviewer   found   the   weight   a   problem ,   it   was   no   heavier   than   my   old   dryer .   i   love   it ! ! ! !
excellent   for   fine   limp   hair   this   hairdryer   far   exceeded   my   expection   for   br   volumizing   and   adding   shine .   br   i   have   limp   and   fine   hair   and   had   tried   anything   br   from   volumizing   shampoo ,   hot   curlers   to   mega   hold   br   hair   spray .   nothing   was   ever   so   satisfying   and   lasting   as   br   the   results   i   got   from   this   hair   dryer .   i   br   blow   dry   as   i   normally   would   and   my   hair   looks   br   bouncy   and   shiny   right   away .   and   it   stays   br   that   way   even   overnight !   i   never   thought   br   this   was   possible   without   going   to   a   professional   br   salon ,   getting   my   hair   stretched   by   large   brushes   and   br   baked   under   a   blowdryer   for   40   minutes .   br   and   there   is   nothing   better   than   stumbling   upon   an   br   inexpensive   product   that   does   wonders .   br   highly   recommended   for   fine   hair .
some   pluses ,   some   minuses   this   is   my   only   experience   with   an   ionic   hair   dryer ,   so   i   have   nothing   with   which   to   compare   this   one .   however ,   i   bought   it   because   i   had   several   expections   about   its   features .   here   is   how   each   feature   measured   up   br   quicker   no .   it   may   even   take   a   little   longer   than   a   standard   1875   watt   dryer .   the   reason   is   that   the   fan   does   not   blow   very   hard .   the   high   setting   blows   about   like   the   low   setting   on   a   standard   dryer .   br   reduced   frizz   flyaways   static   yes .   these   are   significantly   reduced .   br   increased   shine   yes .   my   hair   is   visibly   shinier .   br   quieter   yes ,   but   qualified .   the   only   reason   it   is   quieter   is   because   it   doesn   t   blow   air   as   hard   as   a   regular   dryer .   br   freshens   hair   yes .   br   another   drawback   this   dryer   is   very   heavy .   it   took   me   several   days   to   get   used   to   how   heavy   it   is .   br   this   dryer   delivers   almost   all   of   what   ionic   hairdryers   promise ,   but   i   was   mostly   hoping   for   a   dryer   to   speed   drying   time .   if   you   have   thin   hair   or   hair   that   dries   quickly   or   have   plenty   of   time   to   dry   your   hair ,   then   i   would   highly   recommend   this   dryer .   my   hair   looks   shinier   and   healthier .
