almost   we   almost   loved   this   stroller ,   it   is   an   awesome   stroller ,   except   for   the   bar   between   the   wheels ...   my   husband   and   i   would   kick   this   bar   every   time   we   pushed   the   stroller .   it   has   a   great   canopy ,   it   steers   really   well   and   it   is   super   easy   to   fold   and   carry .   it   folds   in   half   and   is   about   half   the   size   of   the   chicco   travel   system   stroller   and   feels   significantly   lighter
bath   sponge   i   had   this   product   when   my   children   were   babies   and   loved   it   then !   you   can   use   a   regular   bathtub   hands   free   and   the   babies   love   being   submerged   in   warm   water .
good   ones   i   was   expecting   them   to   be   in   different   colors ,   but   white   will   do .   these   were   supposed   for   children ,   not   adults .   i   mean   i   have   read   the   descriptions   and   reviews ,   i   m   not   complaining .   now   i   m   using   these   for   my   scarfs   and   belts   they   are   good !
excellent   for   the   match   to   the   room   decor   this   sheet   matches   sooo   well   with   our   room   decor   it   is   sooo   pretty .   we   are   very   pleased   with   it .   we   just   love   it .
too   big   too   big   for   baby   s   face   making   it   uncomfortable   for   her   and   unusable   for   us .   clear   ones   worked   better   and   she   liked   those   more ...
i   bought   two   of   them   i   received   this   as   a   gift   from   a   hospital   when   my   child   was   born .   i   tried   swaddling   my   baby   with   a   regular   blanket   numerous   times ,   but   i   was   too   exhausted   to   fix   it   over   and   over .   i   loved   this   so   much   that   i   ordered   two   more   one   with   micro   fleece   and   one   made   out   of   100   cotton .   my   daughter   wears   it   on   a   daily   basis   and   keeps   her   warm .
excellent   product   and   service ...   the   product   and   service   are   excellent ,   but   my   grandson   just   wasn   t   very   interested   in   it .   it   was   pretty   boring .   the   only   thing   it   does   is   roll .
can   not   imagine   not   having   this   product   light   weight   and   very   very   convenient .   it   is   34   must   haves   34   when   you   have   a   bay   in   a   capsule .   love   the   big   basket   at   the   bottom .   highly   recommend   it .
great !   i   wanted   something   to   keep   baby   warm   without   bulky   coats   in   the   carseat .   i   am   pleased   with   this   product .   it   goes   on   and   is   removed   easily .   my   only   complaint   is   that   it   does   not   completely   cover   baby   s   head .
bang   for   your   buck   just   got   this   monitor   because   it   had   all   the   features   i   wanted   for   3   month   old   girl   and   it   was   a   great   deal .   br   it   works   great   so   far   and   i   would   recommend   it   for   anyone   with   a   baby .
good   quality   i   havent   used   them   yet   due   dec   1st   however ,   they   are   soft   and   feels   like   it   will   keep   my   lil   one   warm   during   these   winter   months .   br   br   these   are   nice   towels ,   they   do   the   job   and   the   price   is   fair .   def   will   cont   to   purchase   snuggle   baby   towels   from   amazon .
what   a   brilliant   bottle !   i   love   this   bottle !   my   3   month   old   breastfed   baby   is   so   fussy   and   refused   to   drink   from   our   other   bottles   and   instead   of   trying   a   bunch   of   different   bottles   nipples   i   decided   to   find   the   highest   rated   one   on   amazon   and   give   it   a   whirl .   i   was   a   little   worried   since   the   price   was   so   high ,   but   honestly   it   was   worth   every   penny ! !   she   drank   immediately   from   it   and   has   loved   it   every   time   since ! !   br   br   what   makes   this   bottle   so   great   br   1 .   the   nipple   is   large   and   soft   so   your   baby   can   latch   on   to   it   just   like   she   s   at   the   breast   br   2 .   it   is   easy   to   clean   and   easy   to   assemble   br   br   only   downsides   br   1 .   the   air   vents   have   to   be   in   the   right   place   or   baby   won   t   be   able   to   get   any   milk   out .   easy   fix   though !   br   2 .   because   the   nipple   is   so   big   if   the   bottle   isn   t   held   upright   my   little   one   likes   to   turn   her   head   while   she   s   drinking   than   towards   the   end   of   the   bottle   the   milk   will   pool   in   the   side   of   nipple   and   not   at   the   tip .   also   this   makes   it   difficult   to   see   when   she   is   finished .   but   these   are   very   minor   setbacks   in   an   otherwise   brilliant   design !   well   worth   the   fact   that   my   baby   will   drink   happily   from   it !   br   br   don   t   forget   for   breastfed   babies   they   say   it   is   best   to   find   a   nipple   that   is   most   similar   to   your   own .   it   makes   the   transition   easier !   br   br   hope   it   works   as   well   for   you   as   it   did   for   me !
easy   to   install ,   comfortable .   used   for   a   12   hr   each   way   trip   with   a   20   lb   12   month   old .   worked   great   and   she   slept   well   in   it .   have   it   in   a   van   pilot   type   seat   and   it   fits   easily .
sassy   bathtme   pals   squirt   and   float   toys   previous   bath   toys   were   getting   old   and   yukky ,   so   these   cute ,   colorful   and   soft   bath   toys   were   just   the   right   bath   companions   for   the   grandkids .   they   enjoy   playing   with   these   sassy   toys   in   the   tub   at   bathtime .   highly   recommended   for   all   kids .
evenflo   exersaucer   jungle   this   product   is   super   easy   to   set   up   and   baby   absolutely   loves   it .   surprisingly   light .   great   product   that   can   be   adjusted   to   height   of   baby .   i   have   a   4   month   old   who   is   able   to   use   product   warning   baby   must   be   able   to   hold   head   up   good .   the   only   complaint   i   have   is   that   some   of   the   items   have   stickers   on   them   so   wiping   them   wears   stickers   off .   kind   of   disappointing   for   100   product .
crib   rail   is   excellent .   the   crib   rail   is   everything   we   needed   for .   it   allows   us   satisfaction   that   our   baby   will   be   safe   while   he   in   the   crib .   recommend   it   highly .
my   son   loves   these   paci   and   great   to   see   in   dark   at   first   i   was   worried   about   the   fact   that   they   glow   and   wondering   what   is   in   them   but   we   see   no   signs   of   any   wear   and   tear   on   these   after   months .   it   s   so   great   to   be   able   to   find   them   without   turning   on   the   light .   just   hold   them   up   to   a   light   for   like   5   sec   and   they   will   glow   for   the   night .
great !   loved   this   for   my   daughter   and   nephew .   it   helps   the   pacifier   stay   in   their   mouth   while   still   giving   them   the   freedom   to   spit   it   out   if   they   really   want .   my   nephew   loved   hanging   on   to   the   giraffe   when   going   to   sleep .   as   long   as   we   had   this ,   bedtime   was   easy   peasy .
the   best   my   son   is   a   pre   schooler   now   but   he   loved   these   pacifiers .   baby   2   is   on   the   way   and   i   will   be   stocking   up   on   these .
my   daughter   s   favorite   my   daughter   was   born   prematurely ,   and   this   was   the   first   pacifier   she   was   given   in   the   hospital .   i   ve   tried   others ,   but   these   are   by   far   her   preferred   pacifiers .   i   like   them   because   they   are   much   easier   to   thoroughly   clean   than   most   others ,   with   no   little   crevices   to   harbor   dirt   or   germs .   i   also   feel   safer   with   the   one   piece   design ,   with   peace   of   mind   that   these   cannot   come   apart   or   break .   doubt   that   would   happen   with   other   pacifiers ,   but   being   a   mom   i   naturally   worry   about   everything   with   my   daughter .
easy   to   clean ,   easy   to   love   we   ve   had   this   little   giraffe   for   three   months ,   and   he   s   endured   about   two   months   drooly   use   now .   wubbanub   or   wubs ,   as   he   s   called   at   our   house   is   a   great   friend   and   comfort   for   our   baby .   why   major   pros   br   br   easy   to   grip   the   feet   are   just   big   enough   and   round   enough   that   she   can   get   a   solid   grasp   on   any   of   them ,   and   sometimes   two   at   a   time .   br   easy   to   hold   the   little ,   soft   body ,   which   is   filled   with   something   slightly   softer   than   beans ,   is   easy   for   the   baby   to   wrap   an   arm   around ,   and   light   enough   that   she   can   lift   and   spin   the   giraffe   with   one   determined   fist .   br   easy   for   chewing   not   only   are   the   feet   satisfying   for   snacking ,   the   little   horns   at   the   face   make   for   interesting   small   chewy   pieces   against   hier   gums .   br   high   quality   silicone   pacifier   the   soothie   pacifier   that   s   attached   is   great ,   not   just   for   the   usual   soothie   benefits   but   also   because   it   s   very   sturdily   attached   to   the   giraffe   s   body .   it   can   safely   travel   the   washer   and   then   be   rinsed   in   hot   water   itself   for   maximum   cleanliness .   br   br   points   for   debate   br   doesn   t   always   stay   in   her   mouth   longer .   yep ,   true   sometimes   she   tugs   it   out .   but   she   also   seems   less   likely   to   have   the   whole   thing   drop   from   her   grasp   and   fall   to   the   floor   wubs   hits   the   deck   much   less   often   than   the   other ,   solo   soothies   we   have   around   the   house .   br   longevity   we   ve   had   this   in   heavy   rotation   daily   play   time   probably   equal   to   two   hours   for   a   month ,   and   he   s   showing   a   bit   of   wear .   i   imagine   we   ll   need   to   restock   with   a   second   or   third   string   wubbanub   within   the   next   three   months   if   his   popularity   remains   strong .
my   baby   loves   this   pacifier   my   baby   only   likes   this   pacifier .   br   i   love   the   quality   and   color   of   this   product .   the   only   downside   is   that   sometimes   water   or   baby   s   saliva   gets   in   them   and   there   is   no   way   to   clean   this   since   you   cannot   take   it   apart .   br   it   was   shipped   and   arrived   in   time .
product   not   as   pictured   and   covered   the   nose   the   picture   shows   four   pacifiers   with   four   different   colors .   the   actual   product   is   two   pacifiers   and   they   are   identical   and   clear .   if   you   have   two   babies ,   you   can   t   tell   which   pacifier   is   for   which   baby .   the   picture   is   misleading !   br   br   also ,   these   pacifiers   don   t   have   holes   by   the   nose .   i   have   babies   about   8   lbs   preemie   twins   now   one   month   old   and   these   pacifiers   cover   part   of   their   nose   and   make   it   hard   for   them   to   breathe .   i   don   t   think   they   re   safe   for   smaller   babies .   i   would   advise   getting   ones   with   holes   by   the   nose
like   it   it   was   exactly   how   it   was   pictured   on   the   website   it   was   cheap .   i   also   thought   it   was   very   cute
perfect   easy   to   use   the   clevamama   pacifier   sterilizer   is   a   breeze   to   use   and   comes   with   two   silicone   pacifiers   to   start   you .   we   gave   this   to   a   teacher   at   school   and   she   absolutely   loves   it .   what   a   thoughful   gift !   was   her   exact   words .
the   only   pacifier   my   daughter   likes !   we   were   given   this   pacifier   at   the   hospital   because   my   daughter   didn   t   know   how   to   suck   when   she   was   first   born   she   just   chomped   down   which   was   pretty   painful ...   .   she   took   it   right   away   and   it   was   nice   we   could   see   the   way   she   was   sucking   through   the   hole .   at   home   we   have   about   five   different   brands   of   pacifiers   and   this   is   still   the   only   one   she   likes   though   sometimes   she   will   take   a   soothie   .   one   nice   thing   that   i   love   compared   to   the   soothies   is   that   the   handle   part   has   a   hole   in   it   so   i   can   attach   a   pacifier   holder   thing   that   attaches   to   her   shirt .
the   only   paci   we   needed !   my   daughter   is   now   almost   11   months   old   and   this   is   one   of   the   two   pacifiers   she   has   had   for   her   entire   first   year   of   life !   we   can   always   find   it !   after   the   first   7   months   my   daughter   now   leaves   her   paci   in   her   crib   for   naps   and   bedtime ,   so   it   won   t   get   lost ... sometimes   we   see   her   on   the   baby   monitor   playing   with   and   babbling   at   it .   this   is   a   great   first   paci   for   an   infant   the   animal   rests   on   their   chest   and   helps   keep   the   paci   in   while   they   sleep ,   and   then   later   it   kind   of   transforms   into   a   lovey ... we   haven   t   reached   the   point   of   giving   up   the   paci   completely   yet ,   so   not   sure   if   we   will   snip   it   off   and   resew   the   mouth   or   what ... that   would   be   the   only   reason   i   m   giving   it   4   and   not   5   stars .   but   if   only   just   to   eliminate   the   need   for   dozens   of   pacifiers   all   over   the   house !   just   have   two   of   these .
monkey   pacifier   i   had   seen   a   baby   with   this   pacifier   and   thought   it   was   cute .   i   purchased   it   for   my   grandchild .   it   is   real   cute   and   her   mom   had   wanted   it   without   my   knowing   it .
mostly   wonderful   this   was   for   my   6   month   old   son .   if   you   like   the   soothie   pacifiers   it   works   well .   though   the   previous   wubanub   i   ordered   allowed   you   to   remove   the   pacifier   from   the   mouth   of   the   stuffed   animal .   this   did   not .   annoying   but   not   prohibiting .
this   is   the   cutest   thing !   i   bought   this   for   my   three   month   old   son .   the   passy   was   too   small   for   his   liking   but   i   knew   that   might   be   an   issue   when   i   bought   it .   but   it   was   too   cute   not   to   give   it   a   try .   since   my   son   wouldn   t   take   the   passy   i   cut   it   out   and   sewed   his   on   instead .   realistically   i   could   ve   just   bought   a   small   stuffed   animal   and   sewed   his   in   cheaper   but   you   live   and   learn .   this   is   for   younger   babies .   wish   the   company   made   these   for   different   ages .   but   me   sewing   his   in   works   just   fine .
des   baby   womb   bear   bear   was   adorable   and   my   3   week   old   grand   daughter   was   very   interested   in   it   .   seem   to   give   her   comfort .   i   would   tell   all   mothers   to   purchase   one   for   their   baby .   love   that   bear   .
love   it   my   son   and   i   both   love   this   paci .   its   so   cute   plus   its   easy   to   find .   i   would   get   all   of   them   if   i   could
lots   of   fun   my   kiddo   was   supa   cute !   this   product   is   worth   it   for   the   laughs .   he   has   enjoyed   playing   with   it   beyond   halloween   as   well .
love   it   my   son   and   i   both   love   this   paci .   its   so   cute   plus   its   easy   to   find .   i   would   get   all   of   them   if   i   could
love   love   love   !   i   bought   these   for   a   friend   whose   baby   was   in   the   nicu .   these   are   the   pacifiers   we   give   the   babies   in   our   nicu   where   i   work .   the   babies   love   them !   i   don   t   know   if   it   s   the   light   sweet   smell   they   have   or   there   fun   shape ,   but   those   babies   quiet   right   down  
good   pacifiers   but   watch   the   price   we   ended   up   purchasing   these   through   amazon   just   as   a   result   of   having   three   children   and   being   stuck   at   home !   they   are   generally   cheaper   in   stores   than   here .   as   far   as   their   quality ,   it   is   very   high .   i   love   the   high   grade   silicone   and   these   are   the   only   pacifiers   my   daughter   would   use .   they   come   in   a   glow   in   the   dark   line   which   is   helpful   for   locating   by   nightlight .
baby   loves   these   started   using   this   kind   of   pacifier   after   the   hospital   gave   us   one .   baby   gives   it   2   thumbs   up .   still   using   this   not   3   months   one   at   5   months .   will   replace   at   first   sign   of   wear .
sad ..   my   niece   absolutely   hates   this   thing .   she   hates   the   taste   of   it   and   she   gagged   the   first   2   times   i   tried   to   give   it   to   her ,   so   i   just   gave   up .   what   a   waste .....
baby   loves   it !   our   baby   has   been   using   his   wubbanub   since   newborn .   he   absolutely   loves   it .   the   nipple   is   soft   enough   to   chew   and   the   dinosaur   helps   him   with   his   grasp .
wonderful !   bought   this   for   my   nephew .   he   loves   it !   really   helps   them   control   the   pacifier ,   less   spiting   out   onto   the   floor .
used   by   hospitals ...   i   had   mixed   feelings   about   using   a   pacifier ,   but   when   my   baby   refused   to   latch   and   we   were   forced   to   feed   him   breastmilk   from   a   bottle ,   he   needed   some   more   sucking   to   soothe   himself .   the   hospital   have   us   one   of   these ,   and   we   ve   used   them   since .   easy   to   clean   as   well .   buy   lots !   they   tend   to   disappear   around   the   house !
great   for   bottle   nipples   and   pacifiers   this   is   a   great   little   device   for   easily   and   quickly   sanitizing   pacifiers   and   bottle   nipples .   we   selected   this   item   because   we   want   our   daughter   s   pacifiers   to   be   as   clean   and   sanitary   as   possible .   what   we   didn   t   know   at   the   time   is   that   we   d   be   using   this   more   for   bottle   nipples   than   pacifiers .   any   new   parent   knows   about   the   drudgery   of   endless   bottle   washing .   today   s   high   tech   bottles   have   multiple   parts ,   many   of   which   are   difficult   to   clean   well   and   can   t   be   put   through   the   dishwasher .   we   can   wash   the   hard   plastic   bottle   bases   in   the   dishwasher ,   but   we   were   handwashing   multiple   bottle   nipples   and   other   soft   plastic   inserts   every   day .   now   we   sanitize   them   all   in   this   handly   little   device .   it   s   saved   us   so   much   time !
brilliant !   this   is   a   brilliant   invention .   my   twins   like   smoothie   pacifiers   anywa ,   and   this   helps   the   keep   it   in   their   mouths .   the   only   drawback   is   its   hard   to   clean   and   sterilize ,   but   well   worth   it   anyway .
the   speaker   of   parent   unit   stopping   working   after   one   week   bought   it   in   april   but   start   using   it   since   last   week ,   the   speaker   of   the   parent   unit   is   not   working   any   more .   only   video   no   sound ,   even   the   volume   is   turned   to   max .
not   a   must   have   a   must   not   this   carrier   is   one   of   the   worst   on   the   market ,   but   has   somehow   gotten   hyped   as   the   must   have   baby   item .   i   even   had   one   for   a   while   until   i   learned   better .   no   infant   should   have   his   weight   supported   by   his   crotch   proper   carriers   place   the   legs   in   a   frog   like   position ,   hugging   you   tummy   to   tummy .   infants   require   adequate   head   neck   support   as   well   as   the   ability   to   tune   out   overstimulation   the   bjorn   leaves   baby   hanging   both   literally   and   figuratively   when   in   the   again   overhyped   forward   facing   position .   as   if   that   weren   t   enough ,   the   distribution   and   shape   of   the   bjorn   straps   are   a   recipe   for   killer   shoulder   and   back   pain .   a   good   carrier   will   let   you   carry   on   normal   daily   activities   while   babywearing   without   back   pain .   i   was   so   dissatisfied   with   my   bjorn   after   just   a   few   weeks   that   i   tossed   it   rather   than   inflict   it   on   an   unsuspecting   garage   saler .   if   you   want   a   buckling ,   soft   structured   carrier ,   go   with   a   safe ,   comfortable   choice   like   the   kindercarry ,   beco ,   or   ergo .   these   carriers   will   allow   you   to   carry   your   baby   with   ease   through   toddlerhood .   i   m   no   athlete ,   but   i   can   easily   hike   30   minutes   with   my   32lb   toddler   on   my   back   in   a   kindercarry .   for   newborns ,   i   highly   recommend   the   sleepywrap   boba   wrap   or   moby   wrap .   while   it   takes   a   little   practice   initially ,   the   comfort   for   both   of   you   is   amazing   in   a   stretchy   wrap .   i   wasn   t   as   big   a   fan   of   the   moby   the   boba   is   more   stretchy   and   comfy   to   me   but   i   think   many   folks   could   go   either   way   between   them .   the   stretch   wraps   are   generally   most   comfortable   to   around   20lbs .   the   boba   website   has   some   excellent   information   on   babywearing   and   positioning   here   ...

so   far   so   good !   my   son   is   2   months   old   and   i   only   use   this   pump   about   twice   a   week   to   store   milk   for   when   i   m   away   from   him ,   or   for   the   convenience   to   feed   him   from   a   bottle   while   im   out   about .   so   far   it   s   worked   great   for   me .   when   my   breasts   are   full   i   am   able   to   pump   about   4   ounces   from   each   breast   in   10   min   or   less ... for   now   this   is   all   i   need   but   i   will   definitely   look   into   buying   an   electric   one   if   i   ever   need   to   pump   more   to   save   time .
cute ,   simple   fun   this   doesnt   stick   well   to   our   shower   wall   but   my   son   likes   it .   no   other   problems   than   that ,   although   the   string   at   the   bottom   is   pretty   short   so   u   kinda   have   to   knot   it   for   it   to   be   able   to   hold   the   balls   when   its   not   being   used   but   u   could   always   pull   it   out   and   put   in   a   longer   one   if   necessary .

best   bottles   to   date !   we   recently   had   our   second   child   and   used   dr .   browns   exclusively   with   the   first   child .   both   of   us   were   concerned   with   colic   and   too   much   gas   in   our   son   s   stomach .   for   our   second   child   we   started   using   bebek .   here   are   a   few   things   i   have   noticed   as   a   dad   that   makes   a   world   of   difference   br   br   1 .   the   venting   is   identical   or   at   least   we   cant   tell   a   difference   br   2 .   less   parts ! ! !   i   need   to   say   that   again ... less   parts ! !   for   all   you   parents   out   there   who   have   struggled   putting   together   the   dr   browns   pieces   there   really   is   relief !   br   3 .   great   bottle   shape   and   more   comfortable   br   4 .   fast   feeding ! !   love   this   dont   get   me   wrong ,   i   love   to   bond   with   my   daughter   while   i   feed   her   but   with   other   dr   b   it   would   take   us   at   what   felt   like   a   very   very   long   time !   br   br   just   my   2   cents ! !
a   must   have   for   a   newborn !   we   do   use   grovia   diapers   and   i   bought   these   wipes   thinking   i   might   try   cloth   wipes .   as   it   turned   out   i   ve   been   very   happy   using   cloth   diapers   for   over   a   year ,   but   never   used   cloth   wipes .   i   do   however   still   love   these   wipes .   with   a   newborn   they   are   irreplaceable .   a   burping   cloth   was   just   too   big   and   not   very   soft   for   the   constant   clean   up   of   their   cute   face   these   wipes   were   just   the   right   size   and   amazingly   soft .   i   always   had   one   in   my   pocket ,   and   at   least   one   more   in   arms   reach .   we   actually   found   that   we   almost   never   used   burping   clothes   and   bought   a   second   pack   of   these   instead .   now   that   our   baby   is   a   toddler   we   use   them   for   blowing   her   nose   because   they   are   again   so   much   softer   then   a   tissue .   i   would   recommend   these   to   anyone   with   a   newborn   for   a   variety   of   uses   they   were   a   staple   for   us .
graco   4   in   1   blossom   high   chair   i   have   really   enjoyed   this   high   chair .   my   son   was   born   in   october   2012   and   we   had   originally   purchased   a   different   high   chair ,   an   eddie   bauer   wooden   high   chair   that   didn   t   have   wheels   and   had   a   straight   back ,   and   it   was   so   uncomfortable   for   my   little   man .   i   couldn   t   put   him   in   it   until   he   was   able   to   sit   up   on   his   own   at   about   3   4   months   old .   i   wish   we   had   gotten   the   graco   blossom   high   chair   originally   because   the   seat   is   very   nicely   padded ,   can   be   reclined   for   little   ones   that   can   t   support   themselves   yet ,   and   i   love   that   it   has   4   different   seating   options .   we   are   now   expecting   baby   2   so   it   is   really   nice   that   i   ll   be   able   to   use   this   1   chair   for   both   babies   b   c   the   new   baby   can   be   in   a   reclined   position   while   my   1   year   old   can   sit   in   the   separate   booster   seat .   i   also   love   that   it   has   wheels .   the   only   thing   that   would   make   it   better   is   if   the   front   wheels   weren   t   fixed ,   but   that   is   easy   enough   to   work   around .
perfect   fit !   loving   this   crib   pad .   waterproof ,   fits   great ,   and   nice   quality .   looks   like   some   reviewers   shrunk   their   covers ...   i   d   recommend   washing   on   cold   and   drying   on   delicate ,   low   heat   to   avoid   this .
best   bibs   i   ve   found   this   light   blue   one   looks   like   a   scarf   on   my   daughter .   navy   and   red   look   like   western   bandanas   so   cute !   .   absorbs   like   a   dream .   well   made .   wish   all   our   bibs   were   these ... we   would   only   need   3   per   day   instead   of   6   of   the   cheapos .   i   have   7   in   different   colors   and   use   1   per   day .   i   save   it   for   when   we   go   out   so   that   she   still   looks   cute   and   her   outfit   isn   t   ruined   by   an   ugly   huge   bib .   if   only   i   could   afford   21   of   these !   had   to   buy   some   colors   directly   from   silly   billy   s   website ,   but   shipping   is   cheap   there .   love

best   product   for   nursing   i   purchased   this   pump   bra   with   my   first   child .   it   was   a   lifesaver !   i   pumped   for   a   full   year   and   used   this   every   time .   i   am   now   6   months   in   using   it   for   my   second   child .   there   are   no   tears   in   it ,   and   it   has   held   its   shape   despite   daily   use   and   washings .   i   can   t   recommend   this   item   enough !   i   didn   t   want   to   have   to   change   bras   every   time   i   pumped   and   this   fits   over   a   nursing   bra .   i   did   buy   it   a   size   larger   than   what   the   chart   read   for   my   build   to   be   sure   it   fit   long   term .   it   is   adjustable   so   you   can   make   it   fit   from   the   early   days   of   pumping   through   the   later   months .
wonderful   night   light ,   but   doesn   t   last   long !   my   son   received   this   as   a   gift   and   absolutely   loved   it .   unfortunately ,   the   night   light   only   lasted   about   three   months !   when   it   stopped   working   we   contacted   the   company   and   they   were   little   help .   they   said   the   item   was   under   warranty   for   90   days   and   they   sent   us   a   link   to   purchase   another   one .   seriously   !   highly   doubt   we   will   be   purchasing   anything   else   from   a   company   with   pitiful   products   and   warranties .   don   t   waste   your   money .
so   tiny   this   utensil   is   study ,   but   spoon   is   very   shallow   and   fork   is   almost   useless .   my   2   year   old   is   not   able   to   pick   up   any   foods   using   the   spoon   and   fork ...
good   product   it   is   a   good   product   expecially   for   the   price .   it   can   be   used   as   a   high   chair   at   first   and   then   as   a   booster   seat   after   the   child   is   a   little   older .   i   liked   it
very   comfy   i   really   love   this   car   seat !   my   daughter   was   very   uncomfortable   in   her   graco   35   maybe   because   the   straps   had   gotten   too   tight .   but   this   seat   was   very   easy   to   install   in   the   rear   facing   position .   it   is   somewhat   hard   to   loosen   the   straps   at   first   until   you   get   used   to   them .   very   comfy   fabric
saves   me   time   every   day   i   walk   my   dog   and   have   to   take   my   kids   out   with   me   in   the   stroller   every   day   unless   it   s   pouring   rain .   i   have   two   of   these   and   i   feel   they   really   save   me   at   least   20   minutes   if   not   more   every   day .   with   the   bundleme ,   i   don   t   have   to   spend   time   getting   coats ,   gloves ,   hats ,   shoes ,   socks   for   both   kids   and   then   strapping   them   in   the   stroller .   i   just   plop   them   in   the   bundleme   in   whatever   they   were   wearing   inside   usually   just   one   layer   of   clothing   .   they   are   so   comfy   on   our   walks ,   they   just   fall   right   asleep .   i   live   in   maryland   and   it   does   get   cold   here   so   i   opted   for   the   arctic   version   and   i   have   no   regrets .
baby   bib   i   was   excited   to   find   this   bib   for   my   grandson .   i   thought   the   black   background   would   be   great   for   hiding   the   stains   that   normally   plague   baby   bibs .   while   that   is   true ,   i   was   very   disappointed   in   the   appearance   of   the   bib   after   the   first   wash .   the   decal   cracked   and   withered .
as   described ...   this   blanket   is   as   soft   and   cute   as   it   looks !   my   little   boy   drags   it   around   everywhere   it   goes ,   and   it   still   looks   brand   new   after   a   few   washes .
perfect !   we   love   this   clock !   we   had   issues   with   my   son   waking   us   up   at   6   am   even   on   saturday   s   until   we   got   this   clock .   he   now   stays   in   his   room   till   his   little   friend   turns   green !   i   would   recommend   it   to   anyone   that   has   a   child   that   is   an   early   riser   like   ours .
a   perfectly   sized   tub   i   never   thought   i   d   rave   about   a   plastic   tub ,   yet   i   am   very   happy   with   this   tub .   the   infant   seat   is   the   perfect   angle   for   washing   hair   without   getting   soap   in   their   eyes .   the   height   is   right ,   and   makes   it   more   comfortable   for   the   parent   administering   the   bath .   you   only   need   3   5   gallons   to   fill   the   tub ,   so   it   saves   water   as   well .   i   m   confident   we   ll   still   be   happy   with   it   even   when   our   daughter   outgrows   the   infant   seat .
he   claps   and   dances !   we   were   given   the   mozart   music   cube   as   a   gift   at   my   baby   shower .   it   truly   may   be   one   of   the   best   gifts   we   have   been   given .   he   goes   over   to   it   every   day   and   presses   the   buttons ,   clapping ,   dancing   and   giggling   along   with   the   music .   he   s   learned   how   to   change   the   songs ,   how   to   hear   specific   instruments   and   moves   to   the   beat .   plus   my   husband   and   i   never   feel   the   need   to   turn   if   off   because   it   is   annoying   like   some   other   toys .   after   a   year   it   s   still   one   of   the   favorites .   a   friend   of   our   came   over   with   his   5   year   old   who   was   excited   to   play   with   it ,   he   had   one   too   and   said   it   was   one   of   his   favorites .   i   will   buy   this   as   gifts   for   my   friends   who   have   children .   highly   recommended .

not   what   i   was   hoping   for   i   thought   this   product   would   be   functional   somewhat   adjustable   like   a   regular   shower   head   but   it   was   not ! ! !   would   have   sent   it   back   but   didn   t   want   to   waste   more   of   my   time !
super   cute ! !   i   got   this   for   my   cousins   baby   shower ,   also   matching   bibs   and   burp   cloths .   it   was   very   soft   and   cuddly ,   perfect   for   a   newborn ,   everybody   at   the   shower   loved   it .   much   cuter   than   any   pastel   walmart   or   target   blanket  
wonderful   very   happy   with   waterproof   liner ,   since   it   lies   very   flat ,   unlike   other   liners   i   ve   used .   i   ve   subsequently   ordered   3   more   liners !
20   polyester   at   20   polyester   these   are   too   scratchy   and   not   absorbent .   who   would   even   make   a   polyester   washcloth ,   it   makes   no   sense !
great !   great   car   seat ! ! !   exactly   what   we   were   looking   for   great   quality ,   easy   use ! ! !   would   highly   recommend   this   carrier .   love   graco   products !
love   it   but   it   doesn   t   fit   in   car   trunk   so   needs   to   be   returned .   we   bought   for   our   son   and   daughter   in   law   they   love   it   but   it   doesn   t   fit   in   the   trunk   of   their   car .   measure   before   buying !
after   17   months ,   this   is   falling   apart   my   son   is   now   17   months .   this   is   the   only   diaperbag   we   use ,   so   it   s   gotten   a   lot   of   use   for   our   outings ,   travel   daily   trips   to   daycare .   we   loved   it   at   first ,   but   it   is   now   ripping   to   shreds ,   inside   out .   the   straps   have   broken ,   the   lining   inside   is   tearing   out .   i   d   suggest   buying   a   good   quality   regular   backpack   that   has   similar   features   instead   of   buying   this .   i   expected   it   to   last   longer .
very   junky   i   had   to   return   it   it   was   very   junky   and   felt   like   breaking   the   watch   came   broken   as   well   did   not   think   it   will   last   altough   the   price   is   good
straps   too   high   and   wont   hold   baby   long   i   love   the   idea   of   this   seat ,   however   at   3   months   old   my   daughter   is   already   too   big   for   it .   br   it   also   does   not   have   a   vibrating   setting ,   which   would   have   been   nice .   br   the   straps   buckle   very   high   and   make   it   uncomforable   for   the   baby   to   sit .   br   and   does   not   recline   hardly   at   all .   for   the   price   some   more   thought   should   have   went   into   some   of   the   basic   things   the   other   seats   like   it   offer .
much   more   secure   than   the   other   type   we   initially   bought   another   rail   which   had   a   disc   that   you   affix   to   the   mattress .   upon   discovering   how   flimsy   the   attachment   was ,   we   returned   it   and   purchased   the   dex   rail .   what   a   huge   difference !   the   dex   rail   attaches   to   the   spring   frame   of   the   crib ,   not   the   mattress .   yes ,   it   took   a   little   more   work   to   assemble ,   but   it   was   well   worth   it .   i   feel   much   more   confident   placing   my   child   his   converted   crib   now .   thanks   dex !
great   product ,   fast   delivery !   love   it !   we   ordered   this   for   our   daughter   s   nursery .   it   was   delivered   very   quickly ,   in   great   condition .   it   did   take   a   while   to   put   together   but   it   was   not   difficult .
does   not   hold   water ...   there   are   several   features   about   this   diaper   that   i   really   like .   br   it   has   an   opening   on   both   sides   and   comes   with   2   inserts .   br   br   i   don   t   like   that   the   cover   does   not   seem   to   be   super   water   proof .   every   time   i   use   this   diaper   my   1   year   old   leaks .   br   it   would   also   be   nice   if   there   was   a   hip   snap   to   hold   things   in   place .   br   br   overall   it   is   not   horrible ,   but   i   will   probably   not   go   out   of   my   way   to   buy   more   of   this   brand .
loved   this   set   great   for   toddlers   learning   to   eat   with   spoon   and   fork   the   forks   w   plastic   prongs   are   too   hard   for   kids   to   grab   the   food .   the   lip   on   the   plate   helps   them   scoop   food   up .   highly   recommend .
very   easy   to   use   my   niece   loves   it   this   is   very   comfortable   to   use .   it   is   so   much   easier   on   my   back   then   bending   over   to   try   and   hold   her   hands .   my   niece   also   enjoys   being   able   to   walk   around   with   us .   she   seems   very   comfortable   doesn   t   seem   to   notice   it   and   it   fits   very   securely   so   we   know   she   is   safe .   great   product .
great   item   this   item   is   great .   i   am   glad   that   i   purchased   it .   my   son   is   just   coming   up   to   12   months   and   already   eats   on   his   own .   this   spoon   allows   him   to   eat   properly   and   the   food   goes   straight   into   his   mouth .   i   would   definitely   recommend   this   item .
love   it !   love   this   product !   great   height   for   my   son   at   18   months   and   still   at   2.5   years .   great   non   slip   surface   and   loves   to   use   it   all   around   the   house .   i   would   recommend   this   to   anyone !   br   great   product ,   great   price !
very   pleased   really   happy .   these   are   so   cute   and   will   be   great   with   the   tutu   i   purchased . nice   material . i   think   they   will   hold   up   well .
simple   but   great   product !   we   purchased   these   in   preparation   for   our   new   baby .   they   started   holding   baby   and   diaper   supplies   for   us   to   use   and   now   a   year   and   a   half   later   have   turned   into   toy   bins   for   her .   we   were   able   to   re   purpose   some   of   our   existing   furniture   to   make   it   more   kid   friendly .   we   ve   used   a   combination   of   these   bins   on   bottom   shelves   full   of   toys   and   the   smaller   bins   on   the   above   shelves   with   smaller   toys   and   books .   i   have   also   found   them   handy   on   a   self   near   our   front   door   for   all   those   extra   things   you   need   quickly   as   you   re   running   out   the   door   with   someone   in   your   arms .   we   now   have   6   larger ,   4   small ,   and   2   matching   hampers   used   through   out   the   house   and   in   the   brown   they   match   both   in   her   room   and   in   the   public   areas   of   the   house .   br   br   we   also   move   every   couple   years   and   once   the   bins   are   emptied   into   moving   boxes   the   bins   themselves   are   inconvenient   to   pack   and   we   have   broken   numerous   different   types   over   the   years .   i   look   forward   to   our   next   move   with   these ,   and   being   able   to   collapse   them   all   and   put   them   in   a   moving   box   as   well .   br   br   simple   but   great   product ,   the   uses   for   them   are   endless   and   so   good   so   far   holding   up   to   a   toddlers   use .
must   have   for   baby   prevents   paci   from   rolling   into   the   land   of   nowhere .   saved   my   sanity   when   my   babies   were   about   6months   old .   now   that   they   are   almost   1 ,   they   love   the   little   animal .   my   son   will   not   use   an   ordinary   paci   to   go   to   sleep .   had   to   buy   some   back   ups !

baby   loves   this   my   baby   uses   this   since   infancy   until   now .   we   are   very   happy   with   the   product .   highly   recommend   for   baby .   we   love   it
blue   puppy   wubbanub   my   grandson   loved   this   little   wubbanub ,   it   was   a   little   smaller   than   some   of   the   other   wubbabnubs   but   it   was   cute .   it   s   perfect   for   little   hands .
easy   access   paci   pouch   this   pacifier   pouch   does   the   job   very   well .   it   easily   snaps   onto   my   diaper   bag   handle   and   i   never   had   any   problem   with   it   getting   detached   or   anything .   i   like   that   it   has   a   simple ,   velcro   flap   closure   instead   of   zipper   closure   on   a   round   case   as   many   other   pacifier   pouches   have ,   so   it   s   very   easy   to   get   the   pacifier   out .   i   usually   have   my   baby   in   one   arm   when   i   want   to   take   it   out ,   so   velcro   makes   it   easier   for   a   quick ,   one   handed   opening .   i   usually   keep   one   nuk   pacifier   with   a   booginhead   paci   grip   attached   to   it ,   and   it   s   a   perfect   fit .   i   have   taken   2   pacifiers   and   it   was   kind   of   tight ,   but   if   you   don   t   have   the   strap ,   2   pacifiers   would   fit   pretty   well   too .   the   outside   fabric   is   wipable   so   it   s   easy   to   clean   if   anything   gets   spilled   on   it   or   something .
love   em !   i   decided   before   my   baby   was   born   that   i   was   going   to   use   the   soothies ,   so   i   stocked   up .   i   just   kept   being   told   that   they   were   the   only   ones   that   their   babies   would   take !   but   a   friend   of   mine   bought   me   a   pack   of   mam   pacifiers   and   my   baby   loves ,   loves   them !   the   shape   of   the   nipple   is   great ,   and   the   sterilizing   box   is   awesome .   i   ve   only   ordered   some   from   amazon   once ,   and   luckily   i   got   blue   ones   for   my   son .   i   ve   also   bought   some   from   target ,   who   carries   all   different   sizes .   i   gave   some   to   another   friend   with   a   newborn   and   now   her   baby   girl   is   hooked   too !   such   a   great   product   with   such   cute   designs .
ella   bella   wubbanub   asin   b004iy6agw   mary   meyer   ella   bella   elephant   wubbanub   br   br   i   love   wubbanub   s !   what   more   could   i   say   this   is   my   second   wubbanub   purchase . i   ordered   one   for   dbg   before   she   was   born   with   hopes   that   she   would   take   to   it   and   she   did ! we   have   used   our   first   one   which   was   a   small   pink   monkey   now   for   nearly   three   months   and   it   has   been   through   a   lot   and   still   holding   up . i   wanted   to   have   another   as   a   back   up . i   ordered   the   ella   bella   wubbanub   because   it   was   just   too   cute . we   finally   got   it   and   i   am   very   pleased   with   it . it   is   super   soft   and   super   cute . it   is   a   good   size   not   too   small   and   not   too   big ... just   right   and   it   s   not   heavy   at   all , just   enough   weight   to   it   to   help   it   stay   where   you   want   it   to . i   washed   it   and   tried   to   give   it   to   dbg   and   she   would   have   nothing   to   do   with   it   to   my   suprise . i   decided   to   let   her   sleep   with   it   for   a   few   days   along   with   her   monkey   wubbanub   and   it   worked !   i   realized   that   the   reason   she   did   not   take   to   the   new   one   at   first   was   because   it   did   not   smell   familar   to   her . now   she   loves   it   as   much   as   her   monkey   and   i   can   wash   the   other   one   finally ... as   she   will   not   do   without   one   it   is   perfect   in   every   way , it   s   a   pacifier   and   her   lovey   security , she   will   only   take   the   pacifier   when   she   s   sleepy   but   she   will   grasp   the   legs   and   hold   on   tight   and   cuddle   with   it . best   of   all   i   don   t   have   to   dig   for   a   paci   ever ! it   is   so   easy   to   find   any   time   any   where . she   has   a   hard   time   holding   one   in   her   mouth   preemie   and   this   helps   her   to   keep   it   there   and   when   she   does   not   want   it   she   can   just   move   her   head   and   it   falls   out   away   but   stays   with   her . these   are   very   durable . one   of   my   baby   shower   gifts   from   now   on .   br   suggestion   on   washing   i   take   a   mesh   bag   zipped   or   pillowcase   tied   at   the   end   and   drop   the   wubbanub   in   and   throw   it   in   the   washing   machine   on   gentle   cycle , let   it   air   dry   then   wash   the   pacifier   with   warm   hot   soapy   water   or   use   a   pacifier   wipe   and   we   are   good   to   go .   br   i   highly   suggest   this   item   or   any   wubbanub  
kinda   does   the   job ,   but   too   pricey !   this   holds   about   two   pacifiers   but   you   really   have   to   squish   them   together   and   hope   the   container   doesn   t   pop   open   as   there   isn   t   really   a   lock   to   it .   it   s   cute   and   convenient   but   was   so   not   worth   the   money .   use   a   plastic   bag   instead ,   or   make   your   own   out   of   fabric !
omg   thank   youuuu   after   searching   everywhere   and   ordering   wrong   flat   tip   nuk   ones   i   nailed   it .   i   ordered   two   packs   and   got   luck   the   colors   where   3   greens   and   1   blue   thank   god   since   i   have   a   boy   i   was   afraid   of   getting   a   girl   colored   one .   i   think   what   helped   amazon   sort   out   the   right   colors   was   i   also   included   in   my   order   a   pacifier   clip   with   the   colors   green   and   blue   so   they   probably   matched   it .   keep   that   in   mind   if   u   order   these   pacifiers   since   you   can   t   choose   the   colors   order   something   else   with   them   with   the   color   gender   of   you   child   it   might   help   the   person   who   s   picking   out   your   items   in   wear   house .   it   helped   in   my   case .   thank   you   amazon .
not   very   functionable   my   daughter   was   extremely   premature   and   could   not   hold   the   pacifier   in   her   mouth   so   i   thought   this   would   help   like   for   car   rides   and   such .   the   little   caterpillar   is   not   heavy   enough   to   hold   the   pacifier   in   the   babies   mouth   so   it   is   pretty   much   nothing   more   than   a   decorative   pacifier .   at   least   it   is   very   cute !
convenient   convenient   and   cute .   it   is   nice   to   have   on   the   carrier .   it   matches   the   diaper   bag   well   too .   i   love   it .
daughter   seems   to   like ,   they   save   the   day   my   daughter   loves   these   pacifiers .   wish   they   stayed   in   her   mouth   easier   but   it   is   nice   how   there   is   no   34   upside   down   34   and   have   the   handle   which   is   helping   baby   learn   to   put   her   pacifier   back   in   her   mouth .   the   handle   is   also   great   for   pacifier   straps ,   not   all   pacifiers   can   use   standard   straps .   br   br   also   dislike   that   you   can   t   choose   colors ,   probably   will   just   purchase   the   next   level   at   target   so   i   can   choose .   br   br   i   waited   two   weeks   before   breaking   down   and   giving   my   daughter   a   pacifier .   now   we   both   love   these !
god   bless   lamb   my   grandbaby   loves   his   god   bless   lamb .   kuddles   it   all   the   time .   the   pacifier   is   just   the   right   size   for   a   1   to   2   month   old   and   up .
be   careful   picture   showed   blue   and   green   camo   but   what   arrived   was   pink   and   purple .   not   sure   about   a   pink   camo   pacifier   for   my   son .   all   it   says   is   colors   vary .
too   big ! !   these   pacifiers   are   way   too   big .... my   baby   girl   can   t   breath   properly   as   they   almost   cover   her   whole   nose ,   which   prevents   her   form   being   able   to   suck   on   the   pacifier .... and   she   s   3   months   old ! ... they   could   have   made   them   smaller   and   i   would   have   given   them   5   stars ! .... oh   well ,   maybe   when   she   s   5   or   6   months   she   ll   be   able   to   suck   on   them ... but   then   i   ll   have   to   buy   another   set   of   pacifiers   for   6   months   plus ! ...
fits   on   the   car   seat ,   too !   i   carried   this   thing   rather   awkwardly   on   my   purse   for   weeks   before   figuring   out   that   it   snaps   absolutely   perfectly   on   to   the   side   of   the   carseat   handle .   it   doesn   t   get   in   the   way   when   moving   the   handle   back   forth ,   either .   i   ve   seen   at   least   one   review   mention   that   it   only   fits   1   2   pacifiers ,   but   i   have   at   least   three   crammed   in   there .   easy   to   clean   super   convenient   i   always   know   where   to   find   a   pacifier !   plus ,   i   never   doubt   whether   or   not   they   re   covered   in   icky   stuff   after   being   at   the   bottom   of   the   diaper   bag ,   etc .
we   threw   these   away   design   flaw   i   bought   these   based   on   the   great   reviews ,   but   they   were   a   complete   failure .   the   round   plastic   was   so   big   that   it   covered   and   kept   bumping   into   my   son   s   nose .   the   more   he   sucked   the   firmer   it   pressed   on   his   nose ,   which   he   hated   so   he   constantly   spit   it   out .   another   mom   i   know   who   likes   these   admits   that   she   has   to   hold   them   in   her   daughter   s   mouth   or   she   spits   them   out .   what   s   the   point   of   having   a   pacifier   if   the   child   doesn   t   like   it   or   you   have   to   hold   it   in   their   mouth   ! ! !   we   ll   stick   with   the   gumdrop   pacifiers   which   have   a   similar   material   but   much   better   shape .
nighttime   actually   these   are   good   pacifiers ,   but   they   are   the   same   than   the   day   time   once ...   they   glow   only   for   a   couple   of   minutes ,   so   not   helpful   at   all   for   the   night .
love   mam   these   pacifiers   are   awesome .   i   love   that   they   glow   in   the   dark   so   i   can   see   them   in   the   middle   of   the   night   if   baby   wakes   up   after   spitting   it   out .   i   just   wish   i   could   ve   found   them   in   the   smaller   size   when   i   first   introduced   the   pacifier   to   my   baby .
my   3   month   old   prefers   her   0   3   mo   paci   money   wasted .   i   bought   4 .   the   pink   one   is   hard   to   find   too   so   she   s   stuck   on   the   green   ones .
great   quality ,   easy   to   wash ,   cute   for   babies   my   son   tried   6   different   pacifier   brands   and   this   was   the   only   one   he   would   use .   i   ve   purchased   close   to   100   of   them   in   the   last   year ,   since   we   lose   them   like   crazy .   sigh .   anyway ,   when   he   needs   a   pacifier ,   it   s   desperate ,   so   we   have   them   all   over   the   house   now .   i   like   that   these   are   mostly   clear ,   so   we   can   still   see   his   happy   little   smirk   through   the   pacifier .   and   they   aren   t   too   distracting   in   photos ,   etc .   they   come   in   a   variety   of   colors ,   and   we   have   just   about   every   one   of   them .   i   would   definitely   recommend   them ,   however ,   it   s   really   up   to   your   baby   and   their   preference .   the   pricing   on   amazon   is   pretty   consistent   with   target   pricing .
love   our   wubbanub   my   granddaughter   absolutely   loves   her   wubbanub .   and   it   helps   us   keep   track   of   her   pacy .   we   absolutely   love   this   item !
terrible   design   i   use   soap   when   washing   pacifiers   and   the   rest   of   the   baby   products .   if   you   use   soap   on   this   particular   pacifier ,   you   can   t   wash   it   out .   any   way   you   try   to   turn   the   pacifier   to   get   the   water   stream   to   wash   out   the   soap ,   the   soap   is   unable   to   completely   escape .   we   are   back   to   using   regular   soothies .
my   14   month   old   still   uses   my   daughter   started   using   these   around   3   months   and   wont   move   up !   she   loves   these   binkys   and   these   only !   easy   to   clean   and   holds   up   well
cute   and   loveable   my   grandbabies   love   this   pacifer ,   the   toy   that   is   attached   to   it   is   easy   for   them   to   hold   and   find .   it   is   easy   to   wash ,   i   put   it   in   the   dishwasher   when   needed   and   it   comes   out   good   as   new .   better   yet   it   is   easy   to   find   and   easy   to   notice   when   it   is   dropped .
philips   avent   bpa   free   contemporary   freeflow   pacifier   our   young   son   has   been   so   much   more   content   since   we   started   using   these   pacifiers .   i   am   placing   another   order   today .
love   it !   we   purchased   this   once   we   removed   the   breathable   bumper   when   my   daughter   started   using   it   to   try   and   climb   out ,   lol   .   when   all   the   other   binkys   fall   out ,   this   one   stays   in .   saves   me   from   a   midnight   trip   to   give   her   a   binky !
cheaper   elsewhere   by   far   these   are   really   wonderful .   however ,   they   are   10   on   lots   of   other   sites   including   the   gumdrop   pacifier   site   and   come   with   a   gumdrop   pacifier .
adorable !   my   son   loves   this   pacifier   and   its   perfect   for   church !   it   is   very   soft   and   easy   for   him   to   keep   in   his   mouth   not   to   mention   its   easy   for   me   to   keep   up   with !
eh   it   s   okay   my   baby   will   suck   on   these   but   she   doesn   t   seem   to   be   able   to   keep   them   in   her   mouth .   she   nurses   on   the   mams   plugs   much   longer   and   happier
grear   product .   the   product   met   the   description   and   was   exactly   as   pictured .   i   was   very   please   with   the   quality .   would   buy   again !
so   much   cuter   in   person .   mommy   to   be   loved   it !   i   purchased   2   pacifiers   just   chillin   and   pull   to   sound   alarm   .   the   mommy   to   be   absolutely   loved   it   and   burst   out   laughing   along   with   the   guests .   it   was   a   hit .   the   picture   doesn   t   do   it   justice .   it   looks   very   durable   and   very   well   made .   i   was   very   pleased   and   i   highly   recommend   for   all   those   with   a   sense   of   humor .
great   pacifier !   my   husband   and   i   received   these   pacifiers   in   orange   while   in   the   hospital   after   the   birth   of   our   daughter .   we   had ,   as   new   parents ,   gone   out   an   bought   what   we   thought   were   great   pacifiers   tommee   tippee   .   we   quickly   learned   that   what   you   think   you   will   like   vs .   what   you   actually   use   is   sometimes   quite   different .   i   m   not   sure   if   it   was   because   she   was   born   small ,   roughly   5.5   lbs ,   or   because   she   just   likes   the   feel ,   but   our   daughter   refuses   the   tt   pacis   and   instead   prefers   these   alone .   the   nipple   is   more   similar   to   a   breast ,   and   to   a   baby   who   is   exclusively   breastfed ,   i   would   imagine   that   it   is   more   soothing .   we   ended   up   buying   more   of   the   hawaii   medical   gumdrops   because   they   are   awesome .   they   have   a   great   one   piece   design   and   a   little   handle   that   allows   you   to   manipulate   the   pacifier   in   you   little   one   s   mouth .   i   would   highly   recommend   these   to   any   parent .
a   must   have   for   baby   i   watch   childern   in   my   home .   after   someone   telling   me   about   these   when   my   3   yr   old   was   born   it   had   been   her   best   friend   since .   it   is   so   nice   to   have   for   them   to   be   able   to   hold   and   find   easily   when   slips   out   of   their   mouths .   this   is   the   only   binki   she   never   lost ! ! !   was   so   nice   to   have   on   trips ,   and   was   such   a   comfort   to   our   child .   when   i   started   watching   2   new   borns ,   i   bought   one   for   each   of   them .   one   mom   loved   it   so   much   she   bought   some   for   friends   of   hers   that   are   getting   ready   to   have   babies !  
even   more   inconclusivity   the   problem   with   baby   products   is   that   i   can   t   actually   use   them .   well   i   could ,   but   that   would   be   kind   of   weird .   anyway ,   i   have   an   almost   newborn   niece   who   still   uses   pacifiers ,   so   this   seemed   like   a   good   idea .   i   m   not   a   scientist   with   a   microscope ,   so   i   can   t   say   if   this   gets   them   more   sterile   or   less   than   other   methods .   i   guess   it   works   well   enough .   br   br   that   is   all .
great   product   and   quick   shipping !   when   the   product   was   recieved   it   was   packaged   well   and   all   portions   of   packaging   was   intact .   the   product   seems   to   be   of   great   quality   and   is   durable .   i   intend   to   buy   another   variety   of   billy   bob   baby   pacifiers   in   the   future   as   my   daughter   loves   hers !   thanks   for   the   awesome   product   and   quick   shipping   as   well !
lifesaver !   this   was   the   only   pacifier   my   son   would   take .   but   while   sterilizing   during   a   football   game ,   my   husband   melted   the   only   ones   we   had .   this   order   came   promptly   and   at   a   good   price   for   6   units .
baby   yankee   gift   set   very   cute .   quality   is   not   bad   for   the   price .   pacifier   is   for   3   months   though .   thought   it   would   be   for   new   born .   no   big   deal .   i   can   wait   till   he   grows   into   it .
great   just   don   t   wash   or   dry   on   hot !   these   wet   bags   are   great   and   affordable !   they   have   a   very   smooth   pull   string   and   dont   leak   or   smell .   just   do   not   put   them   in   the   hot   water   or   hot   dryer !   they   become   sticky   and   the   pull   string   stops   working ,   basically   it   fries   the   pul .   as   long   as   you   wash   on   normal   or   delicate   its   fine  
our   favorites   these   are   our   favorites .   the   gumdrops   are   cuter   but   my   baby   always   seems   to   shift   them   around   in   his   mouth .   it   s   nice   and   easy   that   these   are   round .   every   baby   is   different   but   these   ones   work   great   for   us .
excellent   natural   rubber   pacifier   i   m   a   big   fan   of   these   being   made   from   a   natural   rubber   versus   synthetic .   as   a   plastics   engineer ,   even   though   many   pacifiers   are   bpa   free   i   prefer   the   natural   rubber   for   my   child .   br   br   my   child   started   using   a   dr .   brown   s   orthodontic   pacifier   at   3   weeks   but   was   not   a   big   pacifier   fan   until   trying   avent   soothie   at   4   weeks .   luckily   we   had   received   several   as   shower   gifts .   however   the   course   of   the   next   8   weeks   we   managed   to   lose   3 !   i   also   had   read   about   replacing   pacis   at   6   8   weeks .   i   would   agree   with   this   when   they   re   teething   or   if   they   reuse   the   same   one   frequently .   but   if   you   have   enough   to   rotate   than   its   bit   necessary .   br   br   i   ordered   these   due   to   low   soothie   supply   the   age   cap   of   3   months .   i   like   that   these   can   go   to   6   months   instead .   my   daughter   has   only   tried   for   1   day   although   not   as   crazy   about   this   one   as   the   soothie   they   have   to   work   harder   because   of   the   thickness   opening   inside   the   paci   she   likes   it !   if   i   had   started   with   this   over   soothie   i   think   she   would   have   gone   right   for   it .   br   br   overall   a   great   product   only   gets   4   instead   of   5   stars   b   c   of   my   daughter   s   preference   for   soothies !
what   a   useful   idea   what   a   clever   idea .   it   s   compact ,   quick ,   and   easy   to   use   which   discourages   laziness .   i   had   my   daughter   try   it   out   for   her   toddler .   she   keeps   it   on   the   counter ,   adds   a   pacifier   or   passy   as   it   s   called   by   her   son   when   it   s   dirty ,   and   when   it   s   full ,   puts   it   in   the   microwave .   gabe   loves   his   passy   and   this   gets   one   to   him   fast .   this   could   be   a   great   baby   shower   gift   and   i   don   t   think   it   would   be   duplicated .   it   s   not   too   much   to   spend   either   for   peace   of   mind   or   a   gift .   pacifiers   often   end   up   on   the   floor   and   i   love   that   this   removes   the   lazy   factor   when   we   don   t   sterilize   and   should .   it   also   comes   with   2   pacifiers .
cute   but   not   a   winner   great   idea   cute   monkey   but   my   6   month   old   great   neice   didn   t   like   it . she   would   not   use   it   at   all .
easy   and   convenient   i   am   a   first   time   mother   my   daughter   was   born   in   august   and   this   was   one   of   the   first   products   i   used   when   i   arrived   home   from   the   hospital .   it   was   so   easy   to   use .   simpy   attach   pacifiers   to   the   little   tree ,   fill   with   water   to   the   fill   line   indicated ,   and   pop   in   the   microwave .   it   was   that   easy   and   quick .   and   when   you   have   a   newborn ,   those   two   elements   are   crucial .   br   br   i   still   use   this   from   time   to   time ,   and   when   not   in   use ,   it   is   the   perfect   holder   for   baby   s   pacifiers .   br   br   excellent   product ,   highly   recommended   to   everyone   who   has   a   newborn .
love !   my   little   guy   loves   this !   it   serves   as   both   his   paci   and   lovey ,   so   it   is   his   go   to   item   right   now ,   and   has   been   for   about   4   months   he   s   9   months   now   .   the   monkey   s   feet   are   the   perfect   size   for   little   hands   to   grasp ,   and   the   whole   thing   is   machine   washable .   my   son   also   chews   on   the   monkey   s   tail   to   soothe   his   sensitive   gums   when   his   teeth   are   coming   through .   i   received   our   first   one   as   a   gift ,   and   purchased   2   more   to   have   handy .   i   highly   recommend   this !
great ! !   this   item   was   great !   it   is   awesome !   get   this ! !   my   experience   was   great !   you   re   baby   will   love   this !   i   very   much   enjoyed   it   because   it   was   soft   and   squishy !
cute ,   but ...   the   toy   is   adorable ,   and   very   soft .   it   is   easy   for   baby   to   grab   and   manipulate .   the   major   problem   is   that   the   soothie   that   is   attached   to   it   is   the   0   3   month   size ,   and   i   cannot   find   them   anywhere   in   a   size   bigger .   as   my   son   just   hit   the   3   month   mark ,   i   will   be   forced   to   upgrade   to   the   3   6   month   soothie   and   take   away   the   monkey   that   he   has   grown   accustomed   to .   and   that   might   make   things   very   difficult .

genius !   we   used   nothing   but   avent   pacifiers   for   our   18   month   old ,   but   thought   we   d   give   these   a   shot   when   we   needed   some   new   ones .   they   are   brilliant ! !   i   never   realized   how   genius   glow   in   the   dark   binkies   would   be !   baby   loves   them   and   they   are   a   perfect   distraction   for   those   occasional   nights   when   she   doesn   t   want   to   get   in   the   crib   give   her   one   and   she   is   absorbed   long   enough   to   conk   out .   i   put   them   directly   under   a   lamp   for   30   minutes   before   bedtime   if   possible   so   they   glow   longer   i   find   them   still   glowing   enough   to   find   8   hours   later .
one   is   not   enough !   one   of   the   greatest   baby   items   we   own !   we   have   two   of   these   and   i   am   considering   a   third !   our   lo   loves   it   and   we   love   that   she   can   put   it   back   in   her   mouth   in   her   own !   just   can   t   say   enough   about   this   wonderful   product !
my   baby   loves   these ! ! !   this   is   the   only   pacifier   my   baby   will   take .   it   keeps   him   quiet   and   relaxes   him   so   i   give   it   all   the   stars
smaller   than   the   pictures   este   chupon   es   mucho   mas   peque   o   que   lo   q   muestran   en   la   pagina   de   compras ,   me   parece   que   deberian   colocar   el   tama   o   real .
uncared   the   child   does   not   perceive   this   as   a   pacifier   nipple   br   perceives   as   a   toy .   br   seems   need   to   use   just   such   birth .   br   to   this   now   use   normal   nipples   avent
good   overall ,   easy   to   attach   to   bags ,   easy   to   clean   size   fits   only   one   pacifier   and   is   tight   but   handy   when   finding   binky   fast .   other   reviewers   say   fits   two   pacifiers .   quality   seems   good   but   haven   t   had   very   long   hope   it   holds   up .   easy   to   clean .
very   useful   product   for   sterilizing   pacifiers   we   have   a   new   grandson   living   with   us   and   have   had   a   blast   checking   out   all   the   new   baby   products   that   weren   t   around   when   we   had   our   three   daughters .   some   have   been   great ,   some   are   just   ok ,   and   some   have   been   a   joke .   this   is   one   that   i   wish   we   had   back   in   the   day .   br   br   for   those   babies   who   love   their   pacifiers ,   especially   when   they   start   crawling ,   this   is   an   awesome   product .   seriously ,   how   many   times   will   a   baby   crawl   around   with   a   pacifier   in   his   her   mouth   and   just   drop   it   on   the   floor   or   carpet   too   many   to   count .   it   s   great   to   be   able   to   do   a   quick   few   seconds   sterilization   in   the   microwave   instead   of   the   old   boiling   water   method .   great   convenience   coupled   with   a   reasonable   price   makes   this   a   must   have   in   my   opinion .
neutral   review ,   my   baby   doesn   t   like   it   i   m   giving   a   neutral   review   because   my   son   will   not   take   this   pacifier .   we   have   tried   several   times   over   a   few   weeks   to   have   my   5   week   old   son   latch   on   to   this   pacifier   but   he   does   not   seem   to   like   the   flat   tip   design .   he   will   take   the   soothie   and   gumdrop   pacifier   that   has   a   rounded   tip   although   the   soothie   is   his   favorite   .   i   wanted   to   like   this   pacifier   but   unfortunately   i   will   never   know   since   my   son   won   t   take   it .

best   pacifier   out   of   all   we   ve   tried !   for   my   baby   shower   i   got   around   8   different   types   of   pacifiers ... my   newborn   daughter   wouldn   t   take   any   of   them .   i   asked   my   friend   she   recommended   this   one .   bought   it   recently   at   baby   s   r   us ,   2   pk   for   4.99   and   my   baby   will   finally   take   it !   yay !
nice   bags !   a   little   small ...   didn   t   use   much .   so   i   bought   this   to   use   in   my   diaper   bag   as   a   wet   bag   for   when   we   are   going   places .   unfortunately ,   it   ended   up   being   too   small   to   really   hold   the   amount   of   diapers   i   would   go   through   i   have   twins .   for   one   baby   it   would   probably   be   perfect ,   though !   i   do   keep   this   rolled   up   and   in   my   bag   in   case   i   need   to   stash   wet   clothes   in   them   or   something .   br   br   sadly ,   i   never   used   the   little   paci   bag .   br   br   if   i   could   go   back ,   i   wouldn   t   purchase   this ,   but   i   can   t   give   the   product   a   few   stars   because ...   it   s   well   made !   it   does   its   job .   i   just   didn   t   need   it   as   much   as   i   thought   i   would .   br   br   my   daughter   loves   blowing   the   paci   bag   up   like   a   balloon   and   playing   with   it .   it   s   that   waterproof .   really   high   quality !   br   br   in   a   nutshell ...   for   more   than   one   baby ,   probably   too   small .   for   a   long   day   outing ...   probably   too   small .   for   a   quick   run ,   probably   perfect !   but ,   who   wants   to   spend   money   on   a   bag   you   can   only   use   part   of   the   time  
wubanub   s   the   best   my   baby   loves   her   wubanub !   the   little   pink   bear   helps   keep   the   pacifier   in   place ,   and   she   can   hold   on   to   it ,   even   though   she   s   only   2   months   old .   also   makes   for   cute   photos .
these   things   are   freaking   great .   my   4.5   month   old   has   started   waking   up   all   through   the   night   looking   for   her   paci .   she   is   just   barely   coordinated   to   get   her   paci   back   in   about   1   3   of   the   time   that   i   see ,   although   she   probably   finds   it   sometimes   and   i   don   t   even   know   .   since   she   has   figured   out   how   to   roll   over ,   she   only   sleeps   on   her   belly .   mam   pacifiers   are   great   for   belly   sleepers   because   they   have   a   low   profile   and   don   t   get   knocked   out   of   baby   s   mouth   when   she   turns   her   head ,   and   they   are   super   light   so   they   stay   in   easily .   i   have   sprinkled   like   6   pacis   around   her   head   at   night   to   increase   the   odds   that   she   ll   find   one .   until   now ,   she   had   been   using   the   under   six   month   size ,   but   i   wanted   to   get   the   6   size   to   see   what   the   difference   is .   the   shield   is   a   bit   larger   and   so   is   the   nipple ,   and   the   nipple   is   more   bulbous   at   the   end .   i   haven   t   noticed   that   she   has   an   easier   or   harder   time   keeping   them   in   than   the   smaller   size .   she   seems   to   not   care   which   size   i   give   her .   the   glowing   is   genius .   only   the   knob   glows ,   not   the   shield   or   nipple ,   so   the   glowing   part   doesn   t   touch   her   face .   makes   it   a   snap   for   me   to   find   in   the   night ,   and   i   m   hopeful   that   it   helps   her   find   them   more   often ,   too !   i   held   them   under   the   light   for   like   10   seconds   before   i   put   her   down ,   and   they   were   much   dimmer   but   still   glowing   12   hours   later .
so   cute   i   love   this   little   monkey !   the   passy   atually   come   with   it   and   it   is   permantly   attached !   my   son   lov   monkeys   they   are   his   favorite ! ! !
what   i   was   looking   for .   i   have   tried   several   different   types   brands   of   pacifiers .   my   baby   did   not   like   any   of   them ,   i   ordered   these   because   my   son   used   this   kind   and   i   could   no   longer   find   them   at   the   store .   she   liked   these   more   than   any   other   type   that   i   have   purchased .
a   big   hit   at   the   baby   shower   my   son   and   daughter   in   law   love   pirate   things .   they   decorated   the   room   for   the   baby   boy   they   were   expecting   in   a   pirate   theme   and   we   had   a   pirate   baby   shower   for   her   ahoy ,   it   s   a   boy   .   i   bought   this   pacifier   as   one   of   the   many   things   to   fill   the   whale   baby   bath   tub .   it   was   a   big   hit   at   the   shower !
okay   if   you   don   t   plan   to   use   it   24   7   this   pacifier   is   adorable   when   paired   with   my   6   month   old   s   monster   onesie   for   halloween .   the   pacifier   is   made   well   and   doesn   t   have   any   harmful   products   like   bpa .   my   only   issue   is   that   the   pacifier   is   way   too   heavy   for   my   6   month   old   to   keep   in   his   mouth .   this   is   a   very   heavy   pacifer   so   it   s   not   something   we   use   daily ,   or   all   day .   he   has   pacifiers   that   he   uses   all   day   at   school   but   this   one   would   not   serve   that   purpose .   i   bought   it   mainly   for   halloween   and   for   that   it   is   great .
perfect   we   live   in   san   diego ,   california   and   are   huge   denver   broncos   fans .   all   we   could   find   around   here   in   local   stores   is   chargers   gear   for   our   baby .   boo   so   being   able   to   find   it   on   here   for   the   price   is   great !   happy   with   the   product .   can   t   wait   til   our   little   one   is   here   to   use   it !
horrible   i   get   that   colors   may   vary .   that   usually   means   a   different   shade   of   blue .   i   got   pink ,   what   am   i   supposed   to   do   with   hot   pink   ones   i   won   t   even   be   able   to   use   these   at   all .
cute   and   useful !   buying   a   pacifier   is   always   hit   or   miss .   kids   are   fussy .   thankfully   my   niece   loved   this   one   and   it   was   adorable !   unfortunately   the   dog   got   a   hold   of   it ,   so   i   had   to   buy   another ,   but   it   was   worth   it !   the   product   came   with   a   cover   and   didn   t   break ,   so   i   d   recommend   it !
cute   pacifier   i   bought   this   for   my   2   month   old   daughter .   she   didn   t   get   it   until   just   shy   of   3   months ,   and   now   hugs   it ,   and   can   therefore   hold   it   in   her   mouth .   i   think   they   are   adorable   in   come   in   so   many   cute   animals .   i   love   it !
love   it !   item   delivered   on   time ,   was   as   described .   love   it !
great   pacifier   holder   i   like   this   pacifier   holder   because   its   large   enough   to   fit   2   3   pacifiers   in   it   and   it   s   great   that   it   can   be   attached   to   the   outside   of   the   diaper   bag   for   convenience .   i   really   love   the   mixed   leaf   design   as   well .   i   purchased   many   jj   cole   items   for   my   new   baby   and   i   really   like   all   the   items   i   have .   they   are   high   quality   and   very   attractive   designs !
loves   his   wubba   as   a   newborn   he   could   only   use   a   soothie   preemie   paci   because   his   mouth   was   small   even   though   he   was   full   term .   by   4   1   2   months   he   needed   to   move   to   a   newborn   size   so   we   decided   to   try   a   wubbanub .   he   adores   his   monkey   wubba   and   it   fits   him   way   better   now   that   he   is   a   bigger   guy .   and   best   of   all   it   is   easy   to   find   and   doesn   t   bounce   and   roll   when   he   drops   it  
nice   a   good   thermometer   with   clinically   relevant   results .   when   used   in   body   mode ,   it   gives   the   same   results   as   the   santa   medical   ry230   ir   thermometer .   regarding   the   delivery ,   it   was   delivered   in   the   last   day   of   the   given   interval   and   the   tracking   was   really   bad .
love   these   wipes   i   use   for   bottle   nipples   as   well   perfect   for   a   diaper   bag .   safer   than   using   baby   wipes .   great   product   and   price
giraffe   doesn   t   hold ,   the   pacifier   is   too   big   this   product   doesn   t   do   what   it   supposed   to .   the   pacifier   is   bigger   and   havier   than   the   toy   s   head   so   it   falls   down ,   the   toy   is   useless . so   expensive . waste   of   money
very   good   and   cute   soothie   very   good   and   cute   soothie .   my   son   picked   up   on   this   immediately   and   easy   soft   for   him   to   hold   on   to   it .
a   god   send !   i   was   anti   pacifer .   then   i   had   my   baby .   amazing   how   things   change !   br   br   my   son   is   about   a   month   old   and   has   reflux ,   which   is   apparently   really   common   in   newborns .   suckling   helps   the   reflux   which   means   he   was   nursing   constantly   constantly .   sometimes   3   to   4   hours   in   one   session .   now   that   he   is   back   up   to   birth   weight ,   he   was   given   the   clearance   for   pacifers   and   bottles .   this   is   the   only   pacifer   that   he   took   to   and   it   has   saved   my   sanity .   probably   his ,   too .   now   that   he   s   not   getting   a   constant   supply   of   milk ,   his   number   of   spit   ups   has   decreased .   but   he   is   still   suckling ,   which   helps   the   reflux .   and   he   s   not   suckling   on   me ,   which   gives   my   body   a   chance   to   recuperate .   he   flat   out   rejected   other   pacifers ,   except   this   one .   i   also   like   that   it   has   the   finger   hole   i   can   hold   his   head   with   one   hand   and   still   have   a   finger   in   on   the   binky   to   help   hold   it   in   place ,   and   still   have   another   hand   free .   br   br   buy   one   pack .   if   your   baby   likes   it ,   too ,   then   load   up !
lighter   than   older   wubanubs   but   still   good   our   oldest   had   the   bear   wubanub   and   it   had   a   bit   more   weight   and   substance   to   the   plush   toy .   this   little   cow   is   so   sweet ,   very   soft   and   squishy   and   light   as   air .   it   s   tummy   is   a   pink   floral   pattern .   i   am   just   oncerned   that   the   plush   toy   part   won   t   hold   up   to   wear   and   tear   as   it   seems   pretty   delicate .
great   product ,   low   price !   my   son   doesn   t   like   pacifiers ,   but   when   he   does   want   one   the   only   one   he   will   take   is   the   dr .   brown   s   pacifier .   they   are   small   enough   for   newborns   to   take .   the   only   downside   is   that   you   can   t   choose   what   color   you   get .
paci   holder   i   bought   this   as   a   gift .   i   think   is   is   so   cute .   i   will   not   see   it   for   a   few   months   and   i   can   update   my   review   after   ai   see   it .   but   i   wanted   something   just   sort   of   fun   for   my   daughters   diaper   bag .   i   am   hoping   this   is   it !
great   product ! ! ! !   received   the   package   very   fast   and   i   am   really   pleased   with   the   paci   tho   so   for   a   diaper   cake   i   am   making  
great   little   blanket   there   s   a   nice   smooth   cool   side   for   hot   days   and   a   soft   fleece   side   for   warmer   days .   nicely   sized   for   hugging   not   to   cover   baby   and   teething   corners   make   this   blankey   a   recommend !
you   need   two   so   i   thought   this   would   be   my   saving   grace   to   not   have   to   endlessly   go   in   and   constantly   reinsert   the   pacifier .   it   helped   a   little ,   but   only   when   i   propped   it   up   with   another   wubbanub   pacifier .
best   binky   ever !   my   daughter   loves   the   soothie   binky   s   and   this   duck   is   our   third   wubbanub   paci   that   we   have   ordered   we   have   the   lamb   and   blue   bear   as   well   .   the   only   complaint   i   have   with   this   one ,   is   it   doesn   t   seem   to   be   stuffed   very   well ,   and   is   rather   floppy   compared   with   the   lamb   and   bear .   br   br   get   tons   of   compliments   on   these ,   and   my   daughter   s   day   care   always   knows   which   binky   is   her   s   without   having   to   label   it !
cute   but   did   not   hold   up   we   ended   up   getting   4   different   styles   of   this   binkie .   my   daughter   loved   them   when   she   was   younger .   i   am   sorry   to   say   the   stitching   did   not   last   on   the   small   part   holding   the   binkie   on   and   it   is   now   coming   off .   she   only   used   it   for   2   months   and   now   i   do   not   feel   it   is   safe   to   use .   it   seems   well   made ,   so   i   am   not   sure   if   we   got   a   bad   one .   over   all   i   love   the   brand   and   idea ,   just   not   this   one ..
perfect   for   baby   he   loves   this   . he   holds   on   to   it   can   not   go   without   it   and   he   is   3   weeks   old   . if   you   have   a   baby   or   grandchild   i   recommend   you   get   as   many   as   you   can   of   these .
colors   my   son   already   loved   one   we   received   in   a   gift .   i   ordered   2   more   and   now   have   2   pink   ones .
wubbanub   mango   monkey   i   got   this   for   my   3   month   old   and   he   seems   to   love   it !   he   gets   excited   and   gurgles   when   he   sees   it   coming   toward   him .   i   like   that   it   gives   him   something   to   clutch   and   feel   while   sucking   on   the   paci .   i   have   read   that   at   this   age ,   babies   like   textures .   i   am   going   to   order   some   more   so   that   he   always   has   one   to   play   with   wile   the   other   is   being   washed .   that   said ,   others   have   complained   about   the   paci   not   being   able   to   separate   from   the   plush   part ,   i   just   fill   a   bowl   with   hot   water   and   meyers   laundry   detergent   just   a   dash   and   let   it   soak   for   10   minutes , rinse ,   squeeze   it   out   and   line   dry   it .
thankful   my   grandbaby   just   loves   these   little   things ...   we   have   ordered   her   3   and   i   dont   think   she   would   want   anything   else
you   will   never   use   this   this   is   one   of   those   nonsense   things   that   you   think   that   you   need   when   you   are   expecting   your   first   baby .   well ,   once   the   baby   actually   comes   you   will   never   use   this .   also ,   the   creepy   light   made   me   feel   like   i   was   doing   something   far   worse   than   just   rinsing   the   paci   off .
love   these !   i   love   these !   i   have   used   them   for   my   baby   since   he   was   about   a   month   old .   he   is   almost   5   months   old   now .   they   seem   to   work   great !   i   love   the   size .   i   tried   a   few   other   brands   and   my   baby   just   would   not   take   them .   they   were   all   too   long   or   the   shape   was   one   he   didn   t   like .   these   seem   to   be   the   shape   and   length   that   he   likes .   i   actually   bought   a   ton   of   these   because   the   baby   kept   dropping   them   everywhere .   i   seriously   will   not   buy   any   other   kind .   they   don   t   have   these   in   the   store   so   i   have   to   purchase   them   on   amazon   and   just   wait   for   them   to   be   shipped .   i   will   be   using   these   for   my   next   babies   for   sure .
light   and   shaped   right   this   pacifier   is   light   and   shaped   right . soft   and   consists   of   whole   thing   not   different   parts .   our   son   s   favorite   pacifier . it   lets   him   breath   as   it   has   a   space   for   nose .
saves   a   lot   of   grief   no   more   toys   on   the   ground .   the   only   negative   is   some   fraying   of   the   straps .   my   son   seems   to   think   they   taste   good   too  
baby   loves   them   i   love   that   these   pacifiers   are   all   one   piece .   my   baby   doesn   t   take   a   pacifier   too   often   but   when   he   does   hes   able   to   keep   it   in .   he   also   really   loves   to   just   chew   on   it   and   i   don   t   have   to   worry   about   him   hurting   himself .   compared   to   other   pacifiers   where   the   plastic   is   harder .   he   seems   to   really   enjoy   them .
love   it   i   highly   recommend   this   product   to   anyone   who   is   or   is   planning   on   using   nooks   for   babies .   it   easily   snaps   on   and   off   so   i   have   this   one   hooked   onto   the   diaper   bag   and   another   onto   my   purse .   this   allows   you   to   now   have   to   dig   through   pockets   or   the   bottom   of   bags   to   try   and   find   the   nook .   it   s   right   there   and   easy   to   grab ,   especially   when   you   need   to   ask   and   older   child   to   bring   one   to   you .   it   also   keeps   the   pacifiers   clean .   it   can   easily   fit   2   or   3   in   there   at   a   time .   the   colors   are   accurate   too .
great   thing   you   don   t   realize   you   need   this   is   a   great   item   to   have   around .   it   makes   it   easy   to   sterilize   paci   s   and   even   nipples   from   bottles .   we   use   this   daily .   would   make   a   great   shower   gift   too !
adorable   doesn   t   lay   right   i   bought   several   of   the   wubbanub   pacifiers   and   we   love   them !   this   particular   one   is   really   cute ,   however   it   doesn   t   lay   like   the   others .   the   legs   are   short   and   don   t   spread   out   so   it   tends   to   tip   over   all   the   time .
so   much   cuter   than   i   was   expecting ! !   i   ordered   this   wubbanub   pacifier   for   our   daughter   who   is   due   in   a   few   weeks .   i   was   excited   about   it ,   because   it   is   so   much   different   than   the   ones   they   sell   in   stores .   it   seems   like   around   where   i   live   they   only   sell   pacifiers   that   look   little   boy   ish   green   frog   and   red   dog   .   so   when   i   saw   this   i   knew   our   daughter   needed   it !   when   it   arrived   i   was   so   pleased .   it   is   so   much   cuter   in   person   than   the   picture   and   i   thought   it   was   adorable   in   the   picture   .   i   am   very   pleased   with   this   purchase   and   would   definitely   recommend   it   to   others   with   expecting   a   little   girl .
just   like   the   hospital   binkies   our   delivery   nurse   gave   us   and   recommended   these   pacifiers   and   i   ordered   these   so   my   daughter   always   had   a   new   one   and   they   are   exactly   like   the   ones   provided   at   hospital .   with   added   design !
love   it ! ! !   thank   god !   our   son   loves   this   soothie !   its   the   only   thing   he   will   use .   he   gags   when   we   tired   to   give   him   the   other   kind   of   pacifier   he   s   so   dramatic   .   he   just   loves   it .
picture   misrepresents   the   picture   shows   2   solid   color   pacifiers .   i   received   2   translucent   pacifiers .   they   look   much   more   modern ,   not   at   all   the   style   i   like .
nice   this   is   hardly   a   required   product   for   raising   a   baby .   that   said ,   it   is   kind   of   handy .   it   only   sterilizes   one   binky   at   a   time ,   at   about   3   minutes .   so   you   don   t   want   just   one   binky   if   you   are   using   this .   it   is   small   enough   to   be   packed   into   a   diaperbag .   it   would   make   an   interesting   baby   shower   gift .
avent   pacifiers   i   use   all   avent   products   and   really   like   them .   the   pacifiers   have   held   up   to   multiple   washes   and   constant   gnawing   from   a   one   toothed   8   month   old .   water   does   get   inside   the   nipple   when   submerged   in   water   and   has   to   be   shaken   out .   the   inside   does   get   a   little   cloudy   over   time   so   i   replace   them   after   about   6   months .
avent   pacifiers   i   really   like   avent   products .   the   only   bad   part   about   this   pacifier   is   that   it   gets   water   into   the   nipple   when   it   s   cleaned .   after   repeated   washings   all   this   water   turns   the   inside   of   the   nipple   cloudy .   i   have   only   used   avent   pacifiers   so   i   don   t   know   if   this   is   common   with   all   pacifiers .
on   the   go   sterilizer   good   for   the   mammas   that   have   to   be   on   the   go .   especially   good   for   playdates   or   going   to   grandma   s   house .   just   pack   it   along   with   the   diaper   bag .   it   s   really   very   easy .
he   likes   it !   out   of   all   of   the   pacifiers   that   we   have   tried ,   this   is   the   only   one   that   works .   the   pricing   also   makes   this   one   the   best   bang   for   your   buck .   this   pacifier   has   been   very   helpful   in   soothing   our   newborn .   it   has   saved   us   from   many   a   sleepless   night .   if   he   s   not   hungry ,   all   we   have   to   do   is   pop   it   right   back   in   his   mouth   and   he   soothes   himself   to   sleep   at   night .   we   have   ordered   this   pacifier   over   and   over   and   will   continue   to   do   so   for   the   next   month .
quick   and   easy   this   product   has   been   a   hit   for   my   daughter   and   my   new   grandson . it   is   quick   and   easy   and   beats   boiling   water   and   waiting   5   minutes .   just   put   in   the   pacifiers   up   to   5   and   pop   into   the   microwave   and   it   is   done .   sterilising   in   no   time .   it   fits   perfectly   in   any   diaper   bag   and   is   a   must   for   those   on   the   go .   i   would   definitely   recommend   this   as   a   great   baby   shower   gift   or   just   for   your   own   use .   great   product .   wish   we   had   these   when   my   kids   were   growing   up !
love   it !   love   this .   it   matches   everything ,   super   soft ,   holds   up   well   after   many   washes   machine   wash   cold ,   air   dry   .   baby   loves   it   especially   when   going   to   sleep .   baby   is   9   months   but   when   she   was   a   newborn   it   was   great   because   it   was   easy   to   find   and   stayed   in   her   mouth   well .   i   also   have   2   pink   princess   ones   and   they   both   are   falling   apart   definitely   recommend   the   monkey .
awesome !   the   wubanub   is   great !   its   light   enough   to   remain   on   baby   s   chest   so   that   you   don   t   lose   it .   baby   can   grab   this   a   bit   easier   than   just   a   pacifier   alone .   her   ellie   is   her   favorite   paci   toy !   definitely   recommend   it   to   any   parent !
perfect   shipping   was   very   fast   for   this   product .   i   am   expecting   so   i   didn   t   get   to   use   this   yet   for   the   baby ,   but   i   did   get   it   out   of   the   package   and   there   was   not   1   thing   wrong   with   it .   it   was   perfect !
great   we   placed   our   order   on   saturday   and   we   received   it   on   tuesday !   very   quick   shipping   and   wonderful   product .   it   is   almost   exactly   like   the   picture   except   the   zebra   stripes   are   grey   instead   of   black .   but   it   is   still   just   as   cute !
cute   and   practical   love   this   cow !   so   cute .   my   daughter   loves   it .   very   soft   and   easy   to   find   when   my   daughter   drops   it   out   of   her   mouth .   would   recommend   any   of   the   wabbanub   line   to   everyone .
dirt ,   seed ,   or   dead   bug   inside   case   the   pacifiers   came   in   a   little   sealed   plastic   case ,   which   unfortunately ,   had   dirt   all   over   the   outside   of   it .   then   what   was   worse ,   was   there   was   dirt   in   the   inside   of   the   case ,   where   the   pacifiers   were .   in   addition ,   there   was   also   something   that   looked   like   a   little   seed   or   a   dead   tiny   bug .   i   m   not   sure   what   it   was .   it   was   really   gross .   i   returned   it   to   amazon   and   also   emailed   nuby   just   letting   them   know .   i   don   t   know   how   it   got   inside   of   the   packaging .   other   than   that ,   the   pacifiers   are   decent .   i   have   a   few   others   that   are   identical   i   bought   elsewhere .   it   s   nice   that   the   water   can   t   get   trapped   in   the   nipple   like   so   many   other   pacifiers ,   but   there   is   still   something   to   hold   onto .   i   have   a   baby   boy   and   of   course ,   like   others ,   received   pink   and   purple   in   color .   annoying ,   but   i   d   just   use   around   the   house   if   i   had   to .   but   as   it   was ,   i   would   never   use   them   because   of   the   dead   bug   or   seed   and   dirt   inside   of   it .   i   would   have   rated   higher   on   the   pacifiers   themselves ,   if   they   were   clean .   i   took   a   picture   and   sent   to   nuby ,   so   maybe   will   attach   here   some   day   if   i   figure   out   how .
lifesaver   these   pacifiers   are   the   only   ones   my   son   would   take .   had   to   go   to   the   store   to   stock   up .   we   now   have   over   10   and   somehow   they   still   seem   to   get   lost .   the   translucent   edge   makes   it   look   less   huge   in   babys   mouth .
baby   loves   them   dr .   brown   s   pacifiers   are   the   best   for   our   baby   three   months   old   .   br   she   prefers   them   hands   down   over   other   brands   i   have   tried .   br   they   work   and   the   quality   of   the   product   is   great .
every   baby   is   different   ! !   so   this   paci   may   or   may   not   be   the   one !   got   a   free   one   of   these   when   we   registered   at   bru .   our   son   usually   takes   the   soothies   pacifiers   used   in   the   hospital .   he   didn   t   seem   to   care   for   this   one ,   and   the   shape   makes   it   pop   right   out   of   his   mouth .   i   threw   it   in   the   diaper   bag   for   an   emergency   backup ,   but   it   s   not   my   first   choice .   at   least   the   silicone   and   durable   plastic   make   it   easy   to   sanitize   and   it   comes   with   a   hygienic   cap .   br   br   please   let   me   know   if   my   review   has   helped   you   in   your   inquiry   or   purchase

adorable !   adorable   sheep !   i   bought   this   for   my   friend   for   her   birthday   and   she   loved   it .   soft   and   cuddly   and   a   nice   small   size .
great   product   theyre   so   cute   with   little   faces   on   them   they   last   long   ,   got   here   on   time   .   overall   great   binky   ! ! !
ok   product   difficult   to   clean !   many   of   my   friends   had   these   and   told   me   that   their   babies   loved   them   so   i   bought   one   for   my   3   month   old   son .   i   thought   at   first   that   the   idea   of   this   item   was   really   great .   a   combination   of   a   pacifier   and   stuffed   animal   seems   like   it   would   be   so   soothing !   my   son   showed   no   interest   in   this   item   and   even   when   i   tried   to   introduce   it   as   he   grew   he   still   wasn   t   impressed .   he   is   1   year   old   now   and   has   never   used   this   item .   so   i   guess   it   depends   on   the   child   if   they   like   it   or   not ,   but   this   is   not   why   i   am   giving   it   two   stars .   i   am   giving   it   two   stars   stars   are   for   the   good   idea   because   this   item   it   almost   impossible   to   clean .   you   cannot   sterilize   the   pacifier   and   when   you   wash   the   stuffed   animal   you   need   to   let   it   air   dry   you   can   t   put   it   in   the   dryer   because   of   the   pacifier   .   i   wish   it   was   made   in   a   way   that   would   allow   you   to   detach   the   pacifier   more   easily   so   that   you   can   clean   the   stuffed   animal   and   pacifier   separately .
very   nice   this   is   very   cute ,   and   it   comes   with   a   cover   for   the   nipple   part .   i   am   taking   it   to   a   baby   shower ,   and   will   probably   get   lots   of   comments   on   it .   i   m   very   excited !
so   cute   i   bought   this   with   the   princess   paci   clip   as   part   a   a   twin   cess   baby   gift .. they   better   in   person .   since   this   is   a   gift   for   twin   i   bought   2   extra   in   case   they   loose   one ...   i   only   saw   these   one   other   place   on   the   internet   so   they   make   a   unique   gift

pink   pacifier   w   hearts   i   received   3   packs   that   were   blue   night   time   pacifiers .   they   are   great .   i   also   received   3   pink   packs   that   were   pictured   as   blue   and   green .   they   are   for   a   boy .   so   we   need   to   send   them   back .   there   were   no   color   choices   when   ordering .
great   baby   item   this   item   is   great   for   my   2   month   old   and   she   loves   it .   since   she   has   really   chubby   cheeks ,   the   other   pacifiers   that   are   more   rounded   tend   to   make   a   red   mark   on   her   cheeks .   this   item ,   however ,   does   not   have   the   rounded   wings   on   it   and   it   s   a   great   item   for   her .   i   recommend   this   item   to   all   chubby   cheeked   babies .
good   soother   my   daughter   loves   her   wubbanub   although   my   husband   thinks   i   like   it   more .   it   s   great   for   her   to   wrap   her   arms   around   and   keep   in   her   mouth   she   is   only   12   weeks   old .   its   also   a   lot   easier   to   find   around   the   house   and   especially   in   the   diaper   bag .   the   only   downside   is   that   the   top   of   the   passie   is   so   high   that   it   presses   on   her   nose   leaving   the   tip   of   her   nose   red   and   looking   like   rudolph .   hopefully   once   she   gets   bigger ,   this   won   t   happen   anymore .
baby   pleaser   baby   boy   loves   the   soothie   pacifier .   the   plush   toy   makes   it   easy   to   prop   up   on   the   baby   so   the   pacifier   stays   in   place .   also   helps   me   keep   it   from   hitting   the   ground   when   moving   him   around .
super   cute   and   soft   easy   to   clean   loved   the   size   color   and   easy   fit   for   nub   pacis   wasnt   really   a   fan   of   it   being   on   the   end   of   his   hand   as   sometimes   it   was   hard   for   him   to   keep   in   his   mouth   with   the   weight   difference   in   the   size   of   the   bear
quite   happy   we   are   very   happy   with   our   new   little   monkey   paccie !   it   s   just   as   pictured   and   we   have   used   these   products   before .   easily   washable   and   easy   to   find   if   dropped .
baby   shower   i   got   these   for   a   very   good   friend   who   is   expecting   twins .   she   is   a   huge   fan   like   myself   and   it   was   a   huge   hit   at   the   baby   shower .
great   product   i   got   this   wet   bag   to   throw   in   the   diaper   bag   for   cloth   diapers   when   we   are   out .   it   s   super   cute ,   and   keeps   the   stink   out !   it   came   with   a   pacifier   bag   too !   very   convienent .   great   price   too !   love   it .   i   would   purchase   again .
good   pacifier   pacifiers   come   with   cover ,   which   is   great   because   kids   drop   stuff   and   so   do   parents !   cute   colors   and   stylish   designs .
must   have   for   babies   this   is   my   absolute   favorite   baby   product .   this   pacifier   is   amazing .   when   my   son   was   a   small   infant   his   pacifier   would   constantly   fall   out   meaning   he   would   wake   up   and   want   it   back ,   but   being   a   infant   he   could   not   find   it .   however   with   this   product ,   if   the   pacifier   fell   out   of   his   mouth   it   would   still   be   lying   on   him   and   he   would   be   able   to   find   it   again   to   sooth   him   back   to   sleep .   not   only   that ,   but   when   he   was   so   young   he   could   start   holding   it   and   directing   it   back   into   his   mouth   or   pick   it   up .   now   that   he   is   just   over   one ,   it   is   his   lovey ,   he   likes   to   have   it   with   him   when   he   is   ready   for   a   nap   or   needs   comfort .   when   he   is   too   old   for   the   pacifier   part ,   i   plan   to   just   snip   off   the   pacifier   and   he   will   have   his   little   friend   he   will   have   a   much   easier   time   letting   go .   br   br   oh   and   did   i   mention   it   is   adorable !
excellent   a   must   have !   this   has   been   a   life   saver   and   is   super   cute   at   the   same   time !   no   more   searching   for   pacifiers   in   the   middle   of   the   night .   i   recommended   purchasing   2   of   them .   i   use   2   in   the   crib   and   there   s   never   an   issue   at   night   with   trying   to   find   a   pacifier .   which   means   more   sleep   for   me !   this   is   all   my   little   one   uses !

the   only   one   my   kid   can   t   take   the   pacifier   off   of !   my   title   says   it   all .   this   is   better   than   any   of   the   other   ones   out   there ,   especially   if   you   have   a   toddler   that   s   always   trying   to   figure   out   how   to   take   things   apart .   my   little   one   is   obsessed !   thank   you   to   who   made   this ! ! !   we   use   nuk ,   natursutten ,   and   dr   browns   with   this   guy .   only   problem ,   where   can   we   buy   a   pink   one ! !  
takes   up   room   than   actually   helps .   my   newborn   daughter   was   given   several   pacifiers ,   from   the   avent   ones   to   the   gerbers .   she   prefers   the   gerbers ,   so   we   bunched   them   all   into   this   pacifier   tree   to   steam   them   up .   br   first   off ,   when   i   received   the   box ,   i   thought   the   tree   was   too   small .   we   put   about   6   pacifiers   before   it   was   stuffed .   br   because   it   s   small ,   they   don   t   fit   the   avent   pacifiers   too   well   since   they   don   t   have   rings .   heck ,   they   don   t   seem   to   hold   any   pacifiers   if   it   doesn   t   have   rings .   br   br   the   steamer   seemed   to   work   fine ,   but   the   tree   was   too   hot   out   of   the   microwave .   the   drainer   didn   t   seem   to   work   well   either ,   so   i   just   had   to   tip   over   the   bottom   to   spill   the   water   out .   br   br   it   seems   fine ,   but   i   wouldn   t   consider   the   tree   a   necessity .
too   big   for   a   newborn ,   my   baby   doesn   t   like   it .   i   am   not   sure   if   it   s   the   shape   or   the   larger   size ,   but   my   baby   just   doesn   t   like   it   and   prefers   advent   soothies   that   she   got   at   the   hospital .   it   also   changes   color   a   bit   once   it   is   sterilized   ...   so   seems   weird   that   it   would .
lov ,   love ,   love   these .   same   pacifier   given   to   babies   in   the   hospital !   my   daughter   had   grown   accustom   to   the   feel   of   the   hospital   brand   pacifiers   since   she   spent   a   couple   of   months   there   after   birth .   i   frantically   purchased   several   look   a   likes   when   we   came   home .   even   at   the   her   tender   age   of   just   a   few   months   old ,   she   was   not   to   be   fooled   by   these   silly   knock   offs .   i   had   a   diva   on   my   hands   and   she   wanted   nothing   less   than   the   real   thing .   i   finally   discovered   that   the   gum   drop   pacifiers   were   identical   to   the   ones   provided   by   hospitals .   they   have   a   vast   variety   of   styles   and   colors   like   asin   b000zexkje   gumdrop   pacifier   full   term   natural   scent   orange   5   pack   and   asin   b007vsm3cm   gum   drop   preemie   pacifier   vanilla   scent   green   for   preemies .   finally   we   were   saved !   br   br   during   my   search   for   the   holy   grail   of   pacifiers ,   i   came   across   these   wubanubs   and   bought   them   mostly   because   they   were   super   cute .   and   since   i   was   starting   a   collection   of   pacifiers ,   i   figured   it   wouldn   t   hurt   to   try .   love ,   love ,   love   these .   and   my   daughter   does   as   well .   br   br   first   let   me   begin   by   saying   that   the   pacifier ,   on   these   precious   dolls ,   are   practically   identical   to   the   make   and   material   of   the   hospital   variety   and   perfect   for   my   little   one .   they   are   perfect   for   little   hands   to   find   and   grab   in   the   middle   of   the   night .   my   daughter   just   puts   her   own   pacifier   back   in   her   mouth .   i   only   wished   i   had   found   them   sooner   since   my   other   two   children   are   grown .   i   could   have   saved   myself   from   trips   to   the   crib   in   the   middle   of   the   night   to   give   baby   back   her   pacifier .   br   br   although ,   they   are   a   little   pricier   than   a   traditional   pacifier ... you   save   money   by   not   having   to   purchase   another   two   pack   because   you   don   t   know   where   the   gazillion   others   you   purchased   went .   i   have   yet   to   lose   even   one   of   these .   they   also   make   a   great   toy   for   baby   as   well .   while   the   pacifier   is   in   her   mouth   she   tends   to   play   with   the   plush   and   tag .   it   appears   to   be   a   somewhat   meditative   motion   that   helps   to   sooth   her   and   or   occupy   her   in   her   carseat   stroller   crib .   so   not   only   is   it   a   pacifier   and   toy   but   it   helps   build   motor   skills   and   actually   pacify .   br   there   are   a   number   of   different   colors ,   animals   and   even   textures   like   this   one   asin   b0031w38yo   wubbanub   plush   pacifier   toy ,   mango   monkey   .   the   asin   b0028h3acs   wubbanub   tabby   kitten   is   my   favorite .   i   have   noticed   that   this   one   along   with   the   tabby   cat   is   slightly   smaller   than   the   other   ones   i   ve   purchased   but   my   daughter   loves   it   just   the   same .   the   pacifier   itself   is   sewn   very   well   to   the   plush   however ,   i   have   cut   the   pacifier   out   of   just   one   after   its   seen   some   wear .   just   as   a   caution .   once   you   stitch   the   hole   back   you   have   another   little   toy   for   baby   to   play   with ,   unlike   the   plain   pacifiers   that   you   have   to   dump .   they   make   great   gifts   and   additions   to   a   shower   basket .   i   have   bought   many   for   my   friends .   when   you   think   of   the   must   haves   in   baby   gear ,   i   personally   would   add   this   to   my   list .   br   br   update   to   wash   or   sterilize ,   i   place   a   small   plastic   sandwich   bag   around   the   plush   to   prevent   it   from   getting   wet .   i   can   then   wash   the   pacifier   with   warm   water   and   anti   bacterial   soap   or   clean   with   a   baby   safe   sterilizer .   then   i   just   take   a   sterile   wipe   or   even   a   baby   wipe   to   gently   rub   the   plush   doll .   it   has   worked   well   for   me   and   keeps   baby   s   gear   germ   free .
mute   button   paci   smaller   than   it   looks   and   so   the   font   on   the   pacifier   is   pretty   small   too .   a   little   disappointed   because   i   chose   this   one   over   another   one   that   was   only   about   a   dollar   more   ... that   one   had   the   cute   little   semi   circle   handle   attachment   too .   well   the   nipple   size   is   good   for   a   newborn   so   it   s   a   keeper .
can   t   think   of   anything   my   kid   loves   more ...   nope ,   nothing   we   got   this   for   our   boy   at   birth ,   and   within   a   few   weeks ,   he   could   hug   it   to   himself .   so ,   it   was   about   50   times   less   often   that   we   d   have   to   reach   over   and   adjust   his   pacifier .   the   beads   inside   help   to   keep   wubba   on   our   son   s   chest ,   even   when   he   was   very   little ,   further   reducing   the   amount   of   retrieval   we   had   to   do .   that   adds   up ,   and   you   can   count   it   in   whatever   sanity   is   measured   by .   the   monkey   is   cute   and   soft ,   but   very   durable .   whenever   he   gets   grungy ,   he   just   goes   in   the   wash   with   normal   clothing .   i   love   this   product   so   much   i   got   the   giraffe   to   leave   at   the   in   laws .
can   not   choose   colors   my   previous   review   was   denied ,   and   does   follow   review   guidelines .   this   is   what   i   said   previously   br   br   got   the   package   within   two   days ,   and   for   that   i   am   happy !   i   am   only   disappointed   that   i   was   unable   to   choose   colors .   i   did   leave   a   note   that   these   were   for   a   boy ,   but   received   a   pink   and   a   purple .   br   br   3   5   stars   for   an   awesome   product   with   fast   shipping   but   docked   for   inability   to   choose   the   colors   of   an   item   you   pay   for .
exactly   what   we   wanted   we   have   been   using   an   angelcare   movement   and   audio   only   monitor   for   our   son   s   first   3   months ,   and   while   it   has   been   great ,   i   really   don   t   know   how   we   lived   without   having   video !   now   that   our   son   is   moving   more   in   his   sleep ,   this   helps   us   know   if   he   s   fussing   because   he   s   worked   himself   into   a   corner   or   if   he   s   just   fussing   himself   back   to   sleep .   great   for   peace   of   mind   and   so   nice   to   be   able   to   peek   at   him   without   going   into   the   room .   br   br   the   night   vision   is   fantastic   and   i   like   that   there   s   no   distracting   light   needed   for   the   camera .   i   do   plan   to   mount   the   camera   on   the   wall   so   we   get   a   better   view ,   but   so   far   we   are   very   pleased   with   this   purchase .   the   two   way   talk   feature   is   a   nice   touch   as   well .
excellent   for   anyone   interested   in   cds   i   am   a   busy   work   at   home   mom   committed   to   at   least   trying   cloth   diapers .   we   ordered   pocket   diapers   from   several   brands   1   fuzzinbunz ,   1   blueberry ,   1   bumgenius   and   2   charlie   bananas   to   start   with .   we   loved   the   blueberry   mini   so   much   we   ordered   2   more   minis   and   1   more   large   one .   really   easy   so   far   and   no   issues .
no   leaks ,   good   fit ,   sometimes   gets   smelly   i   love   that   the   snaps   allow   this   cover   to   fit   varying   size   and   growing   babies .   cloth   lining   makes   it   very   comfortable   for   baby .   this   has   kept   all   messes ,   big   and   small ,   inside .   every   now   and   then   stuff   gets   on   the   cover   lining ,   usually   when   it   s   a   heavy   one .   heavy   or   normal   messes   still   leave   the   cover   smelling   a   bit   like   urine   after   a   few   uses ,   probably   because   the   lining   will   soak   up   moisture   also .   our   routine   now   seems   to   be   to   alternate   about   two   covers   a   day   with   hand   washing   and   line   drying   once   a   day   to   prevent   stink   obviously   a   washer   wash   with   bigger   messes   .   not   a   big   deal   for   us ,   we   just   wash   it   real   quick   in   the   shower   and   hang   it   in   the   bathroom .
used   it   with   our   first ,   and   now   our   second !   my   husband   and   i   are   both   musicians   and   love   this   toy   for   our   children !   when   my   5   year   old   was   about   6mo   old ,   we   found   this   toy   at   a   local   general   store ,   and   picked   it   up   for   her   for   only   10 .   she   would   crawl   all   over   the   place   scooting   more   like   scratching ,   but   who   s   counting   lol   it   on   the   floor ,   and   when   the   music   would   stop ,   she   d   start   it   again   and   keep   going .   when   she   got   older ,   she   liked   to   take   it   with   her   to   listen   to   music ,   and   played   the   music   every   night   until   she   was   about   2 .   then   we   got   her   a   cd   player   and   she   only   played   with   this   one   about   2   or   3   times   per   week .   when   we   found   out   i   was   pregnant   with   baby   number   2 ,   she   offered   to   give   her   brother   her   favorite   baby   toy   it   was   sweet !   .   sadly ,   the   baby   dropped   it   off   the   table   it   had   been   dropped   and   thrown   more   times   than   i   can   possibly   count   ,   and   we   had   to   replace   it .   i   love   the   design   of   the   new   circle .   it   s   easier   to   push   and   more   attractive   for   a   baby   s   eye .   plus   the   rings   around   the   handle   adds   to   an   already   great   toy   and   makes   it   awesome !   i   have   recommended   it   to   many   many   people ,   and   will   continue   to   do   so !
bought   for   my   autistic   son   i   bought   this   for   my   son   who   has   a   tendency   to   suddenly   bolt   when   we   are   in   big   crowds .   he   is   8   and   is   the   size   of   a   12   year   old ,   so   i   was   worried   that   it   might   be   too   small .   but   it   actually   is   very   big   and   will   likely   fit   him   for   numerous   years .   the   only   downside   is   that   he   can   undo   the   buckle   himself ,   but   i   ll   come   up   with   something   to   cover   it   so   that   he   can   t .   i   m   pleased   with   my   purchase .
i   absolutely   love   these   snack   bags !   couldn   t   live   without   them   and   love   that   i   can   wash   them   too !   when   my   son   lost   his ,   we   were   using   baggies   like   crazy .   i   feel   like   i   m   doing   something   good   for   the   earth   and   they   are   convenient   too .
cute ,   but   tempting   for   toddlers   i   bought   this   as   a   replacement   for   a   more   traditional   night   light .   definitely   cuter   than   the   other   night   light ,   but   it   isn   t   as   bright   that   could   be   a   benefit ,   depending   on   what   you   want   .   br   br   my   2   year   old   daughter   definitely   prefers   this   to   the   other   night   light .   she   loves   hello   kitty ,   and   she   was   absolutely   delighted   when   it   arrived .   however ,   every   so   often   she   tries   to   play   with   it ,   which   worries   me .
must   have   for   use   as   burp   cloth   i   can   t   imagine   having   lived   without   these   as   burp   cloths .   baby   was   super   colicky   the   first   three   months   with   lots   of   reflux   and   constant   spitting   up   it   took   us   a   few   months   to   isolate   his   dairy   intolerance   .   i   had   two   packs   of   these   and   wished   i   d   had   four .   i   can   t   emphasise   enough   how   great   they   are   and   how   much   i   ve   relied   on   them   and   continue   to   rely   on   them   now   that   baby   is   a   year   old .   i   m   sure   i   will   use   them   until   they   absolutely   fall   to   pieces   whenever   that   is   as   they   are   still   in   great   condition   a   year   later   after   constant   use .   i   m   now   buying   them   for   a   friend   whose   just   had   her   first   baby .   br   br   also   noteworthy   when   baby   got   a   nappy   rash ,   i   used   these   around   the   house   instead   of   our   regular   cloth   nappies ,   just   pinned   them   on   both   sides .   this   allowed   him   to   get   plenty   of   air   without   getting   the   carpet   wet   but   i   had   to   change   him   as   soon   as   he   did   anything .   obviously   didn   t   use   a   plastic   cover  
handy   bag   to   have .   works   well   bag   is   not   overly   huge   but   not   to   small   either .   had   no   roblems   with   it . very   comfortable   to   wear .   of   course   this   bag   isn   t   made   to   please   everyone   i   will   say   it   can   withstand   some   tugging ,   pulling   and   plenty   of   spills .   easy   to   clean .   and   since   i   bought   it   for   my   wife   she   thought   it   was   perfect .   it   suited   our   needs   and   most   of   the   time   i   wear .   and   as   you   can   see   it   s   quite   fashionable   lol .   i   have   no   problem   wearing   this .   but   now   if   it   was   pink   and   flowery ....   ehhhh   idk .   but   overall   it   s   a   great   product .   if   your   a   dad   and   you   know   you   ll   be   having   it   with   you   most   of   the   time ,   look   no   further .
don   t   waste   your   money ! ! !   this   product   was   sooooooo   bad .   water   went   to   my   daughter   s   eyes   and   she   cried .   it   was   our   first   time   try .   you   shouldn   t   waste   your   money   for   this .
cute   ladybug   backpack   we   bought   this   backpack   for   our   2   1   2   year   old   daughter   to   take   to   preschool .   it   is   very   well   made   and   seems   durable ,   although   we   ve   only   had   it   two   weeks .   it   is   small   enough   that   she   can   easily   wear   it   on   her   back ,   but   large   enough   to   fit   her   belongings .   i   am   able   to   fit   two   extra   outfits   in   this   bag ,   plus   a   travel   package   of   baby   wipes .   the   shoulder   straps   are   somewhat   far   apart ,   but   this   makes   it   easier   for   my   daughter   to   get   the   pack   on   and   off .   she   does   not   have   a   problem   carrying   it   on   her   back .   the   design   is   cute   and   i   am   happy   that   she   doesn   t   have   the   same   backpack   as   every   other   little   girl   in   her   class .
no   spill   but   leaks !   don   t   waste   your   time   with   this   product .   your   child   will   easily   get   liquid   all   over   themselves .   it   doesn   t   spill   but   it   leaks !   how   the   nipple   is   separate   from   it   s   base   and   if   your   baby   clamps   down   on   the   nipple   and   distorts   it   s   shape   or   pushes   the   nipple   into   the   bottle   which   happens   so   easily   it   unlaches   from   the   orange   ring   base   around   nipple   and   the   liquid   comes   streaming   out .
very   cute   but   stitching ,   border   detail   a   bit   off   matches   jake   set .   very   adorable   rug .   husband   noticed   that   detail   is   not   meticulous ,   over   all   very   minimal   but   would   have   liked   it   to   to   be   perfect .   purchased   aug   2012
for   my   80   year   old   father   a   very   useful   device   to   keep   my   eyes   on   my   80   yr   old   father   who   is   mobility   challanged .   this   monitor   not   only   works   for   babies ,   but   is   a   great   tool   for   the   elderly !   he   s   a   bit   frustrated   on   the   lack   of   privacy ...   but   i   convinced   him   that   his   safety   was   our   primary   concern   and   he   can   cover   the   camera   lens   anytime   he   wants .   he   doesn   t   like   it ,   but   i   love   it !
cute !   super   cute   pacifier ,   and   appears   to   be   good   quality .   i   didn   t   expect   my   son   to   love   it   since   it   s   more   of   a   novelty   pacifier ,   and   he   doesn   t .   he   ll   tolerate   it   for   a   few   minutes ,   just   enough   for   people   to   see   how   cute   it   is .   i   would   buy   it   again ,   it   was   a   good   price   for   how   cute   it   is .
not   needed   this   pouch   is   not   needed   you   can   barely   see   it   on   the   side   of   the   britax   marathon   car   seat .   i   feel   it   was   a   waste   of   .
good   box ,   poor   assembly .   the   toy   box   itself   looks   nice   and   seems   like   it   will   be   functional   for   its   purpose .   however ,   the   actual   assembly   of   the   box   very   difficult .   this   was   because   the   manufacturer   forgot   to   drill   the   holes   on   the   front   side   of   the   box   for   the   crossbars .   i   had   to   go   purchase   drill   bits   and   drill   the   holes   myself .   this   turned   what   should   have   been   a   quick   put   together   into   a   huge   project .   otherwise ,   it   was   mostly   fine .   the   board   in   the   bottom   doesn   t   slide   in   or   stay   in   easily   during   assembly   but   i   don   t   know   if   that   is   because   of   an   issue   with   the   product   beyond   this   or   just   from   the   holes   i   had   to   drill   myself .
love   this   crib .   i   have   2   year   old   twins   and   we   are   still   using   these   cribs .   i   have   loved   them   the   entire   time .   they   set   up   easily .   love   that   the   instructions   are   on   the   bottom   platform   so   you   can   t   lose   them .   we   have   gone   through   the   chewing   stage ,   there   is   bite   marks   but   you   can   only   see   them   when   your   up   close .   we   are   expecting   our   3rd   baby .   i   m   do   happy   that   this   crib   is   still   available .   i   will   be   buying   another   one .   i   love   that   it   will   grow   with   our   children   and   we   only   have   to   buy   them   one   bed .   they   are   beautiful   cribs !
both   baby   and   i   love   it   i   just   bought   another   one   of   these   for   a   gift ,   because   i   think   it   s   so   great !   i   originally   purchased   for   my   baby   at   6   months   old   and   i   wished   i   would   have   had   it   sooner .   there   were   times   where   baby   would   be   crying   or   coughing   and   suddenly   stop .   was   she   ok   i   didn   t   know   without   pulling   over   until   i   got   this   mirror .   now   a   quick   check   in   my   rear   view   mirror   and   i   can   see   how   what   she   s   doing   and   sometimes   she   is   doing   the   cutest   things   in   her   car   seat   .   also ,   with   the   recommendations   to   leave   babies   rear   facing   until   age   2 ,   it   s   extra   nice   to   have   this .   my   daughter   loves   this   too   she   ll   make   faces   or   smile   at   herself   in   the   mirror .   also ,   this   mirror   is   not   gaudy   looking   it   looks   nice   a   subtle   in   any   car   interior .   i   would   highly   recommend .
great   quality !   love   this !   the   first   thing   i   noticed   was   how   soft   it   all   was ,   right   out   of   the   packaging .   i   rarely   write   reviews   but   had   to   make   sure   to   write   one   about   this   set .   it   was   very   soft ,   and   i   love   the   fact   the   top   flat   sheet   has   bottom   edging   so   it   doesn   t   just   get   kicked   off   by   the   little   ones .   almost   like   a   half   fitted   sheet ,   very   nice .   any   kid   that   loves   sesame   street   or   elmo   will   love   this   set ,   my   little   man   loves   elmo   and   i   love   the   fact   one   side   of   the   pillow   cover   has   a   big   picture   of   elmo   the   other   side   is   cookie   monster   it   is   not   all   elmo   though ,   so   if   you   are   looking   for   just   him   it   s   not   for   you .   but   there   is   sufficient   elmo   that   my   little   guy   loves   it .  
cute ,   but   ...   my   son   doesn   t   love   it .   he   will   pick   just   about   any   toy   over   it .   we   got   this   because ,   at   6   months ,   he   loves   to   bang   on   things .   i   think   he   passes   this   toy   over ,   however ,   because   it   is   so   sensitive   to   the   slightest   touch ,   as   another   review   states .   there   s   no   cause   and   effect .   also ,   i   do   not   see   how   this   toy   can   roll   to   promote   crawling .   the   sides   are   not   firm   enough .
adorable   i   haven   t   given   this   to   my   daughter   yet   because   it   is   for   her   5th   birthday   next   month   but   i   tried   it   out .   it   casts   so   many   stars   onto   the   ceiling .   it   actually   surprised   me   that   it   covered   the   whole   ceiling   of   my   bedroom   my   bedroom   is   pretty   big   .   i   guess   i   just   imagined   it   would   project   enough   to   cover   a   small   section   of   the   ceiling .   my   2   year   old   son   was   in   the   room   when   i   tested   it   out   and   he   was   amazed   by   all   the   stars   as   well .   he   was   mad   when   i   had   to   put   it   away .   guess   he   s   getting   a   turtle   version   of   this   for   christmas .   the   ladybug   is   also   adorable .   i   saw   that   some   of   the   customer   pictures   featured   one   with   closed   eyes   but   in   the   main   picture   her   eyes   were   open .   mine   arrived   with   her   eyes   open   and   i   was   pretty   pleased   about   that .   i   think   she   s   cuter   that   way .   anyway ,   i   think   my   daughter   is   going   to   love   it .   if   not ,   i   m   giving   it   to   my   son .  
love   these   started   using   these   for   my   5   month   old   when   she   started   solids .   the   spoon   width   and   the   angled   feeding   is   comfortable   for   me   and   less   messy   all   around .   she   also   enjoys   chewing   on   these   when   not   eating   as   a   teether .   i   will   purchase   these   again   in   the   future .
great   bumper .   easy   to   install ,   looks   cute ,   and   serves   it   s   purpose .   also   keeps   my   daughter   s   legs   from   getting   stuck   in   between   the   crib   slats .
great   toy   the   toy   exceeds   my   expectation .   br   my   son   enjoyed   kicking   at   it .   br   both   my   wife   and   i   think   it   is   well   worth   the   money   if   the   kids   love   it .
fits   any   stroller !   i   love   this   sun   shade ,   i   previously   had   a   shade   for   a   specific   stroller ,   was   great ,   other   than   the   velcro   on   the   stroller   pulled   the   mesh ,   and   was   continually   something   i   was   having   to   fiddle   with   when   folding   and   unfolding   as   long   as   my   stroller   when   unfolded   i   love   how   this   will   fit   any   stroller !   my   only   tweak   would   be   a   separate   bag   for   the   shade   that   could   hang   off   the   back   of   the   stroller   when   not   in   use .   i   think   the   current   pocket   storage   is   a   bit   fiddly   to   figure   out ,   and   i   m   not   sure   i   am   even   doing   it   correctly .   but   all   in   all ,   we   love   this   awning .
works   for   windows   too   munchkin   quick   install   gate   the   munchkin   website   only   illustrates   this   quick   install   gate   for   doors ,   but   i   bought   it   as   a   solution   for   a   window   and   it   works   great .   the   honeycomb   plastic   lets   air   pass   thru   and   keeps   toddlers   from   pushing   against   the   window   screen   and   falling   out .   i   can   tell   you   that   this   is   very   secure   if   installed   on   the   interior   window   jam .   my   window   still   is   able   to   slide   up   and   down   without   interference   from   the   gate .   it   can   also   be   removed   in   seconds   if   needed   to   use   the   window   as   a   fire   escape .   the   seller   on   my   gate   was   shipped   and   sold   by   amazon   llc ,   and   shipping   was   very   quick .
love   it !   i   bought   two   of   these   pacifiers   for   a   friend   s   baby   shower .   she   loved   them !   i   think   one   might   be   used   on   the   husband ...   o   o   br   br   the   items   arrived   swiftly   after   purchasing   them .   br   br   great   quality !
glow   in   the   dark   mam   such   a   great   idea   to   have   these   glow   in   the   dark   i   wish   more   companies   did   this   with   there   pacifiers
totally   recommended ! ! !   5   stars !   recommended   for   newborns   toddlers ,   nicu   babies   as   well .   this   is   one   item   i   will   give   as   gifts   because   its   unique   and   i   can   proudly   say   that   all   babies   that   i   know   have   not   refused   it   and   end   up   falling   in   love   with   it !
looks   nice   but   doesn   t   perform   this   pacifier   looks   nice   and   green   but   doesn   t   really   perform   well .   it   squishes   my   baby   s   nose   making   her   spit   it   out .   had   to   return .
baby   loves   them   i   bought   this   for   my   little   one ,   she   loves   the   0   3   soothie   so   i   figured   she   would   like   these   once   she   got   a   bit   older .   they   are   same   size   as   the   0   3   green   one ,   they   are   just   a   bit   more   stiff   for   the   older   mouth .   i   would   definitely   recommend   this   pacifier .
great   little   pacifier   my   wife   bought   this   for   our   new   baby   about   2   months   ago .   she   has   used   it   every   day   since .   she   loves   the   soothie   brand   pacifier   and   she   loves   this   one   a   lot .   baby   likes   to   grab   the   plush   body   while   sucking   on   the   pacifier .   great   product ,   would   definitely   recommend .
like   them   better   than   soothies !   these   are   great .   my   newborn   can   keep   this   paci   in   his   mouth   better   than   soothies .   the   nipple   is   the   same   shape   as   the   soothie   which   was   important   since   i   m   nursing .   we   have   had   zero   nipple   confusion .   our   lactation   consultant   also   recommended   using   a   paci   soothies   or   gumdrops   only   to   prevent   confusion   saying   they   ve   actually   been   recommended   to   prevent   sids ... sold .
great   item   love   the   wubbanubs ! ! !   this   was   for   a   gift   so   i   don   t   know   how   it   s   holding   up   but   i   purchased   two   others   for   my   son   and   he   used   them   for   almost   a   year   although   he   wasn   t   a   big   pacifier   fan .   it   was   our   go   to   for   car   rides   and   daycare .   br   br   this   item   shipped   fast   from   the   seller .   the   only   downfall   was   the   packaging   it   came   in .   it   was   just   in   a   plastic   bag .   when   i   have   purchased   these   in   the   past   they   were   in   plastic   containers   which   makes   a   much   nicer   presentation   for   a   gift .
great   product .   you   will   be   happy !   i   received   my   first   wubbanub   at   a   baby   shower ,   and   i   am   so   glad   that   i   did !   it   has   been   a   life   saver   because   like   the   other   reviews   say ,   it   stays   in   place   very   well   on   my   son   s   chest .   the   only   negative   comment   i   can   make   is   that   the   area   where   the   paci   is   sewn   to   the   doggie   mouth   has   begun   to   rip   and   is   almost   completely   separated .   it   is   beyond   repair ,   but   it   is   worth   the   15   to   replace .   you   will   be   satisfied   with   this   product .
great   pacifier ,   best   for   bf   babies   but   caution   with   size   this   is   a   great   pacifier .   it   is   ideal   for   breastfed   babies .   that   is   why   it   is   one   of   the   top   pacifiers   recommended   by   docs   and   hospitals .   br   br   even   though   my   baby   and   i   love   this   pacifier   it   is   the   only   one   that   we   use   and   i   highliy   recommend   it ,   i   do   want   think   it   is   important   to   highlight   some   of   the   shortcomings   warnings   that   people   should   know   about .   but   even   with   these   problems ,   it   is   still   the   best   option   out   there .   br   br   things   you   should   know   but   the   pacifier   is   still   worth   it   br   1   hard   to   hold   the   little   tiny   tab   on   the   back   is   really   hard   for   a   parent   to   find   and   hold .   i   have   dropped   this   pacifier   many   times   when   trying   to   hold   the   little   tab .   br   2   it   is   hard   to   clip   it   is   hard   to   find   something   to   clip   and   keep   this   pacifier   tied   to   baby .   but   that   is   the   point .   it   is   not   recommended   to   stap   the   pacifier   to   baby   because   it   is   yet   another   item   they   can   choke   themselves   with .   br   3   hard   for   baby   to   hold   control   until   baby   is   a   bit   older   3   6   months   and   has   better   control   of   his   her   hand ,   this   pacifier   is   not   easy   for   baby   to   hold   and   or   push   back   into   the   mouth .   other   pacifiers   have   large   handles   or   areas   for   small   and   uncontrolled   hands   to   reach   for   and   grab .   not   this   one .   br   4   caution   about   sizes   this   is   really   important ,   and   i   only   discovered   this   recently .   there   are   two   sizes   newborn   0   3   months   and   3   months   .   the   first   size   is   much   softer ,   the   second   size   harder .   it   is   important   to   change   your   baby   to   the   larger   size   when   they   reach   3   months   because   they   start   being   able   to   bend   the   whole   pacifier   in   the   mouth   and   can   even   accidentally   make   the   whole   thing   bend   and   fit   in   mouth !   super   scary   and   dangerous .   though   there   are   two   small   holes   on   either   side   of   the   pacifier   that   should   allow   baby   to   keep   breathing   if   this   were   to   happen ,   that   gives   me   little   comfort .   the   3   month   size   is   much   firmer   and   will   prevent   baby   for   bending   and   shoving   the   whole   thing   in   mouth .   so   make   sure   you   move   to   the   second   size !   br   theyhave   also   changed   the   way   they   package   and   label   the   sizes ,   to   make   everything   more   confusing !   before   it   was   a   newborn   0   3   month   size ,   and   then   a   3   6month   18month   size .   now   the   second   size   is   simply   labeled   as   3   months .   still   the   same   pacifier ,   just   new   packaging   to   make   sleep   deprived   moms   feel   even   more   crazy ....  
not   worth   the   money   i   thought   that   the   wubbanub   would   be   more   weighted   to   help   in   stay   in   my   baby   s   mouth ,   kind   of   like   a   beanie   baby .   but ,   it   is   not   weighted   at   all   and   didn   t   do   much   at   all   to   help   the   paci   stay   in   my   sons   mouth .   i   returned   the   product .
cute   and   helpful   when   my   son   was   less   than   5   months   this   was   a   little   too   heavy   for   him ,   we   used   it   just   around   the   house   and   for   emergencies .   now ,   at   6   months   he   s   stronger   and   it   s   really   nice   to   have ! !   however ,   even   though   he   is   stronger   it   does   seem   to   get   knocked   drop   out   of   his   mouth   easier   than   those   without   the   toys   on   them .   br   the   little   stuffed   toy   does   help   with   locating   it ...   i   can   never   seem   to   find   the   pacifiers   that   are   just   solo .   overall ,   i   really   like   it   and   would   recommend ! !
super   easy   to   use   i   always   find   that   once   a   pacifier   is   on   the   floor   it   needs   to   be   washed .   with   the   pacifier   tree   i   can   do   a   bunch   of   pacifiers   at   once ,   without   the   hassle   of   washing   them   one   at   a   time .   not   only   is   this   is   great   time   saver   but   also   helps   keep   the   pacifiers   sanitary .
wubbanub   giraffe   this   a   great   product   for   baby .   it   was   shipped   fast   and   reasonably   priced   well .   baby   just   loved   this   item .   thanks ,   amy
time   saver   time   savings   is   what   the   clevamama   pacifier   tree   is   all   about .   this   is   a   really   handy   contraption   that   gives   the   busy   parent   a   quick ,   reliable ,   and   easy   way   to   keep   pacifiers   clean ,   sterilized ,   and   together .   holds   and   sterilizes   up   to   6   pacifiers   using   the   microwave   as   a   super   fast   way   to   get   things   done .   this   is   incredibly   easier   and   quicker   than   boiling   them   in   a   pan   of   water   on   the   range .   as   far   as   construction   quality   goes ,   it   feels   plenty   sturdy .   i   can   see   no   reason   why   it   wouldn   t   hold   up   to   regular   use   with   no   problem ,   provided   you   don   t   throw   a   tantrum   and   throw   it   against   a   wall ,   in   which   case   you   ll   probably   be   needing   the   pacifiers   for   yourself   instead   of   for   baby .   it   really   is   a   nice   design ,   it   s   compact ,   making   it   easy   to   store   in   a   cabinet   or   on   a   counter   top   without   it   being   invasive .   definitely   one   of   those   things   you   don   t   realize   you   need   until   you   already   have   one ,   then   wonder   why   you   went   so   long   without   one .
says   color   may   vary ,   but   received   transparent   !   i   bought   this   pacifiers   because   i   wanted   some   colored   ones .   item   description   said   color   may   vary ,   but   instead   received   transparent   ones !   i   didn   t   mind   any   color ,   but   a   color   at   least .   very   disappointed   to   receive   both   transparent .
great   and   cute !   my   son   loves   this   and   holds   the   giraffe   too !   ordered   a   bear   too   !   easy   to   wash   with   mesh   bag   in   machine .
flimsy ,   small   and   functionally   suspect .   the   pipila   portable   pacifier   sterilizer   is   something   i   thought   would   come   in   handy ,   having   two   twins   who   are   beginning   to   teethe ,   but   there   are   some   issues   that   stop   this   from   being   an   everyday   use   kind   of   product .   the   item   itself   seems   terribly   flimsy ,   and   just   has   a   cheap   feel ,   much   cheaper   than   i   would   expect   from   a   product   that   s   more   expensive   than   a   lot   of   competing   products .   maybe   it   s   composed   of   a   tough ,   lightweight   plastic ,   but   if   something   looks   cheap   and   feels   cheap ,   well ,   let   s   just   say   it   doesn   t   inspire   a   lot   of   confidence   in   a   product .   br   br   the   next   concern   is   battery   life ,   which   is   rather   poor .   i   guess   those   uv   rays   must   take   a   lot   of   juice ,   because   a   fresh   set   of   batteries   doesn   t   last   very   long .   that   leads   in   to   wondering   just   how   well   this   thing   works ,   especially   when   the   batteries   start   to   die   down   a   bit .   it   takes   about   3   minutes   to   sterilize   a   pacifier ,   but   there   s   no   real   way   to   know   how   well   it   s   working .   also ,   the   directions   tell   you   to   rinse   off   the   pacifier   prior   to   use ,   so   that   might   limit   just   how   useful   it   is   when   you   re   on   the   go .   ultimately ,   i   just   wonder   if   using   this   is   really   any   better   than   rinsing   off   the   pacifier   under   very   hot   tap   water .   br   br   i   wanted   to   like   the   pipila   portable   pacifier   sterilizer ,   but   at   the   end   of   the   day ,   it   just   leaves   me   wondering   if   it   s   doing   the   job .   i   can   see   it   having   a   place   for   people   going   out   of   town   for   a   bit   and   wanting   something   available   to   help   sterilize   a   pacifier   if   they   re   staying   away   from   home ,   but   the   need   for   water   to   rinse   the   pacifier   and   the   size   small ,   but   not   that   small   limits   its   usefulness   for   those   truly   on   the   go ,   while   there   are   better ,   cheaper   ways   to   get   the   job   done   when   you   re   at   home .
good   binkies !   we   ve   always   used   avent   brand   pacifiers   and   our   daughter   has   never   had   a   problem   with   them .   we   boil   them   for   2   3   minutes   before   giving   them   to   her ,   and   put   them   in   the   dishwasher   regularly .   they   clean   very   well ,   and   they   are   durable .   the   only   thing   is   that   when   we   hand   wash   them   with   dish   soap ,   the   soapy   water   gets   into   the   inside   of   the   nipple   from   the   handle   part ,   like   the   picture   part   of   the   binky .   so   we   have   to   hold   the   pacifier   nipple   side   up   and   squeeze   the   nipple   for   the   water   to   come   out .   otherwise   we   love   these   pacifiers .
great   for   baby !   these   are   absolutely   adorable   and   useful .   they   are   bigger   so   they   keep   the   pacifier   in   babies   mouth   and   also   are   good   for   baby   to   hold .   i   love   these .
does   the   job   my   daughter   is   a   pacifier   junkie ,   and   while   it   would   be   nice   to   start   weaning   her   off   of   them ,   i   value   my   sleep   at   night ,   so   i   got   these   to   replace   lost   ones   and   seems   to   satisfy   her   fine .
great   paci   for   picky   babies   after   trying   numerous   other   brands ,   this   is   the   only   one   my   dd   would   use .   they   are   also   cute   come   with   a   carrying   case .
i   never   knew   i   d   use   it !   honestly   i   didn   t   think   i   needed   one   more   convenience   item   to   take   up   counter   space .   but   the   price   is   low   enough   to   consider   giving   it   a   try .   once   i   realized   how   simple   it   was ,   how   little   space   it   actually   took   up ...   well   i   m   hooked .   first   off   i   want   to   say   that   most   of   the   time   there   are   over   10   pacifiers   floating   around   the   house .   someone   is   always   picking   them   up   and   putting   them   on   various   counters ,   tables   etc .   since   putting   this   handy   device   on   the   counter ,   now   everyone   just   tosses   the   found   pacifiers   right   into   it !   makes   it   convenient ,   because   i   can   always   find   one   when   i   need   and   i   know   it   s   been   sanitized .   the   bonus   was   that   it   came   with   pacifiers ,   so   we   have   plenty   to   go   around .   overall   i   wouldn   t   normally   consider   buying   this   item ,   but   now   that   i   have   it ,   i   think   it   rocks ! !
nice ,   but ...   my   son   likes   these   pacifiers ,   and   they   seem   to   be   made   well   except   that   the   michigan   logo   rubbed   off   after   only   about   a   month .   it   s   just   plain   white   on   the   front   now .   it   may   be   because   he   will   sometimes   suck   chew   on   the   front   side   in   any   case ,   the   logo   is   not   there   anymore .
wubbanub !   great   pacifiers   for   babies .   it   gives   them   something   to   hold   while   on   the   pacifier   and   after   weaning   our   kids   off   the   pacifier ,   we   cut   off   the   pacifier   part   and   they   had   little   stuffed   animals   to   sleep   with .   br   we   purchased   a   total   of   5   for   both   our   children ,   and   is   our   go   to   gift   for   our   friends   with   newborns .
so   cute   my   children   are   long   grown !   i   haven   t   shopped   much   in   the   baby   field   since   i   don   t   have   grandchildren   but   this   is   the   cutest   item   i   have   seen   in   a   long   time .   i   love   the   covers   that   are   on   pacifiers   now ,   how   smart .   bj
great   time   saver .   i   ve   been   watching   my   sister   s   newborn   for   the   summer   and   this   has   been   more   than   a   stress   reliever   for   me .   i   don   t   know   what   is   is   but   as   soon   as   i   put   the   pacifier   in   his   mouth ,   if   i   turn   for   a   second   it   s   on   the   floor .   with   the   pacifier   tree ,   i   just   put   a   bunch   in ,   nuke   em ,   keep   some   distilled   water   nearby ,   dip   them ,   and   pop   them   right   back   in   to   the   lil   bundle   of   joy   s   mouth .   i   have   to   say ,   when   i   had   my   triplets ,   i   wish   i   would   have   known   about   this   product !   it   is   easy   to   keep   clean .   i   even   dropped   it   and   it   didn   t   break !   i   can   t   recommend   this   enough ,   if   you   want   an   extra   bit   of   time   saving   along   with   peace   of   mind .
love   it   this   product   makes   sanitizing   pacifiers   so   easy   and   quick !   i   don   t   use   bottles   so   i   didn   t   need   a   big   sanitizer ,   this   is   small   so   it   doesn   t   take   up   much   space   at   all .   i   wish   i   had   found   it   sooner .
obsessed   with   hk ,   these   are   great !   if   you   are   a   hello   kitty   fan ,   these   are   a   must   for   your   little   princess !   they   are   exactly   like   the   regular   nuk   pacifier   6   18   months ,   just   adorned   with   awesome   hk
so   soft   and   cute   if   your   baby   likes   smoothie   pacifiers   then   this   is   perfect !   no   more   lost   binkies !   my   son   loves   it   and   it   s   super   cute ,   i   ordered   another   one   the   next   day !
not   my   favorite   i   thought   this   would   take   the   place   of   my   son   s   gerber   paci   since   the   ones   he   likes   are   hard   to   find   because   they   are   older   .   he   was   not   very   into   it   and   refused   to   take   this   paci   even   though   it   is   shaped   simular   to   the   ones   he   uses .   it   looked   silly   and   huge   in   his   mouth   even   though   he   is   large   for   his   age   and   was   10   months   at   the   time .   i   was   not   a   fan   but   maybe   it   would   work   great   for   someone   else .
very   good   the   expected   mom   loved   it .   it   got   here   fast .   br   would   buy   again .   other   people   asked   me   where   i   got   it .   br   though   i   think   you   have   to   wait   till   baby   gets   older ,   not   for   new   born .   br   you   should   buy   it   if   you   want   a   unique   gift .   that   s   why   i   bought   it .   my   friend   was   saying   at   the   baby   shower   she   got   lots   of   new   born   clothes   and   the   baby   would   never   be   able   to   use   them   all .
wubbanub   we   all   love   this !   daughter   likes   to   hold   monkey   s   paw   even   when   not   using   the   soothie .   friends   and   family   think   its   such   a   cute   idea .   i   was   little   worried   about   price   but   she   enjoys   it   so   much !   the   monkey   is   well   constructed   and   so   soft .
great   product   this   was   a   great   gift   for   my   grandson .   he   loves   these   little   pacifiers .   at   4   weeks   he   can   push   them   into   his   mouth !
very   funny !   great   idea   to   make   mom   and   others   laugh   and   a   plus   for   the   baby .   why   because   he   will   recieve   more   attention   of   course !
stays   in   best   our   first   daughter   did   not   take   to   the   pacifier ,   but   our   second   sure   does !   a   friend   recommended   this   brand   after   trying   many   with   her   daughter .   we   found   this   brand   to   stay   in   the   best   and   keeps   her   nose   clear   as   it   is   small .
great   pet   baby   gate   you   could   buy   the   same   gate   for   pets   at   a   chain   pet   store   at   3   time   the   cost ...   works   the   same ,   looks   the   same ,   so   cheaper   is   always   better !   very   happy   with   my   purchase .
just   as   described   i   bought   these   as   extras   and   they   give   me   peace   of   mind   that   i   will   never   have   a   delay   in   using   the   breast   pump .
works   great   if   you   know   what   you   re   doing   you   may   need   to   buy   some   extra   parts   for   installation ,   but   its   worth   it   once   you   install   it .   water   pressure   is   nice .
okay   generally   okay   socks .   cute   and   do   the   job   of   covering   the   feet   but   not   the   best   regarding   slip   resistance .   they   ran   small   for   my   dd .   she   wore   them   for   6   12   months   instead   of   the   suggested   12   24   months .
great ,   but   leaks   one   of   the   great   items   that   i   bought   for   the   baby .   i   m   very   pleased   with   the   item .   it   does   its   job   perfectly   as   i   expected ,   but   one   thing   that   i   don   t   like   is   it   leaks   when   the   milk   goes   through   the   bottle .   it   seems   like   bottle   and   upper   part   don   t   fit   perfectly .
phil   ted   s   metoo   hook   on   high   chair   i   bought   this   chair   when   my   grandchild   was   born   and   used   it   for   our   second .   it   s   portablility   makes   it   a   breeze   to   bring   to   a   restaurant ,   as   well   as   use   for   the   home   and   it   takes   up   very   little   space   when   folded .   my   experience   is   that   it   has   been   sturdy   and   i   appreciated   it   being   adjustable   to   different   thicknesses   of   tables .   this   is   the   third   one   bought ,   two   others   were   gifts   and   very   much   used   and   appreciated .   i   highly   recommend   this .
great   songs !   i   purchased   this   for   my   nephew .   before   gifting   it ,   i   wanted   to   listen   to   the   songs   to   know   what   he   would   hear .   i   liked   them   and   thought   it   was   great .   he   is   now   seven   months   old   and   i   just   saw   a   picture   the   other   day   with   him   holding   it   in   his   hand .   i   think   the   music   is   stimulating   while   the   beads   offer   moving   parts   for   even   more   interest .   he   looked   like   he   was   enjoying   it   very   much !
look   no   further   we   bought   a   more   expensive   tub   first   and   returned   it ,   after   which   my   mom   bought   us   this   one .   needless   to   say ,   it   was   perfect .   we   used   it   when   our   baby   was   tiny   with   the   little   butt   bumper   in ,   and   now   that   he   s   almost   eight   months   old   we   use   it   without   the   bumper   and   he   just   sits   up   in   it   i   lay   him   down   to   rinse   his   hair   .   we   ll   use   it   for   as   long   as   he   fits !   the   little   orange   cup   is   one   of   his   favorite   toys ,   and   the   price   is   excellent   too .
lovely   i   received   this   item   being   a   little   skeptical   since   there   is   only   one   picture   on   the   website   but ,   i   must   say   that   i   am   happily   surprised .   it   has   beautiful   quality   and   it   is   very   plush .   the   accompanying   fitted   sheet   is   nice   and   soft   and   even   though   im   not   a   fan   of   bed   skirts   it   actually   looks   very   nice   as   well .   br   i   wish   i   could   also   find   some   other   elements   of   this   bedding   set   like   a   diaper   stacker   or   a   mobile .   br   overall   very   nice .
suction   cup   is   useless   we   bought   these   for   our   twin   sons   and   it   didn   t   take   long   for   them   to   realize   that   the   bowl   can   be   pushed   around   on   the   tray   even   after   suctioning   it   down .   these   caused   quite   a   mess   as   they   were   thrown   across   the   dining   room .   however ,   as   they   got   older   and   learned   how   to   use   spoons   more ,   these   bowls   have   worked   out   well   because   they   are   easy   for   them   to   scoop   out   of   and   hold   just   the   right   amounts .
disappointing   we   bought   this   after   researching   a   lot   of   high   chairs ,   and   have   been   so   disappointed   after   using   it   for   two   months   that   we   re   now   just   hoping   to   offload   it   via   craigslist .   it   has   a   very   large   footprint   not   nearly   as   sleek   as   we   d   hoped .   it   looks   very   plasticky   and   cheap   and   clunky .   the   folding   mechanism   is   completely   useless ,   as   the   wheels   are   on   the   front   and   the   legs   fold   so   that   the   back   legs   are   shorter   than   the   front   ones ,   meaning   that   the   folded   chair   is   resting   on   wheels .   so   you   can   t   just   fold   it   up   and   lean   it   against   a   wall .   br   br   the   main   advantage   of   this   chair   is   that   it   is   easy   to   clean .   the   molded   plastic   seat   is   very   easy   to   wipe   down .   i   wasn   t   sure   when   i   bought   it   if   it   was   hard   plastic   or   a   softer   foam   type   surface ,   but   it   s   very   hard .   the   tray   is   nice   and   large ,   although   i   didn   t   find   the   pop   out   tray   to   be   all   that   helpful   since   food   gets   caught   in   the   cracks .   br   br   we   went   with   a   fisher   price   space   saver   booster   chair ,   and   very   much   prefer   the   simplicity   and   functionality   for   our   8   month   old .
works   great   with   bumgenius   2.0   cloth   diapers   other   reviewers   have   mentioned   this   but   these   liners   work   great   with   the   bumgenius   2.0   cloth   diapers .   i   think   we   ve   tried   every   brand   of   disposable   liner   that   amazon   sells   and   these   are   the   best   value ,   in   my   opinion .
it   sold   me   once   we   started   to   use   it   got   this   as   a   gift   was   not   registered   for   it .   was   sort   of   dubious   however   now   that   we   use   it   i   love   this   thing .   very   functional ,   fits   well   in   the   sink   lots   of   different   levels   for   drying   many   different   things .   i   would   actually   buy   it   again   if   something   were   to   happen .
happy   for   the   inconsolable   baby ,   especially   during   the   middle   of   the   night ,   this   item   just   might   do   the   trick .   if   they   never   get   used ,   that   s   ok   too .
love   it ! !   i   purchased   this   gate   for   my   boston   terrier .   it   works   great   because   there   is   nothing   for   him   to   put   his   back   legs   on   to   climb   out   like   the   other   gates .
great   bottle   but   one   problem   i   love   these   bottles   easy   not   clean ,   look   great ,   safe .   the   only   problem   is   that   the   white   plastic   fitting   that   holds   on   the   nipple   has   cracked   for   me   twice .   and   i   can   t   seem   to   find   a   replacement   for   purchase .   you   can   buy   a   separate   nipple   replacement   and   cap   but   not   the   plastic   fitting .   i   guess   i   must   buy   another   whole   bottle   set   i   think   this   is   a   huge   missed   opportunity   to   make   this   product   more   sustainable   for   its   life   cycle .   br   br   otherwise   a   great   product .   i   had   been   using   for   an   older   baby .   by   the   way   i   tried   the   doctor   brown   fittings   and   they   do   fit   ok   but   there   is   some   leaking .
bumper   it   is   so   beatiful   and   good   quality .   my   first   baby   like   this   bumper   she   have   good   sleep   .   i   recommend   this   item .   thank   you .
depends   on   your   sink   faucet .   i   bought   the   aqueduck   first   and   i   love   it .   its   snug   onto   the   faucet .   i   needed   another   one   and   since   this   one   came   with   two ,   i   bought   them .   it   fits   unto   my   faucet   but   its   a   lil   loose .   but   for   the   price ,   its   still   worth   buying .   all   my   friends   love   it   and   now   they   want   one   for   their   houses .
great   product   these   scissors   are   great   for   little   hands   and   nails .   i   was   so   terrified   to   cut   my   son   s   nails   after   he   was   born ,   but   these   made   it   easy   and   pain   free .
perfect   highchair   booster   we   ve   had   this   highchair   booster   for   about   a   year   now   and   absolutely   love   it .   it   s   really   sturdy   and   stays   put   in   the   chair .   the   tray   is   a   bit   of   a   pain   to   snap   on   and   off ,   but   if   you   snap   off   just   one   side   and   then   lift   that   straight   up   it   comes   right   off .   it   folds   quick   and   easy ,   though   really   doesn   t   get   small   basically   the   back   rest   folds   over   ,   but   it   s   better   than   nothing !
worked   for   us   we   ve   used   each   set   and   my   daughter   likes   both   of   them   equally .   it   s   fun   for   her   to   see   her   food   transform   to   shapes   and   she   will   eat   more   if   she   thinks   the   food   is   fun .   this   worked   for   us .
black   white   fun !   daughter   loves   the   variety   and   the   high   contrast .   the   ball   is   just   the   right   size   for   her   little   hands .   i   likes   that   items   are   different   developmental   levels   such   as   the   book   and   the   rattle .
more   compact   but   slightly   more   difficult   to   use .   this   base   is   more   compact   than   the   base   that   came   with   the   carseat .   it   doesn   t   have   the   easy   release   latches   but   wasn   t   too   difficult   to   move   around .   it   fit   in   the   planeside   check   carseat   bag   attached   to   the   carseat   which   was   nice .   going   to   use   it   as   an   extra   base .
won   t   stay   upright   i   should   have   read   the   other   reviews   ...   this   duck   doesn   t   stay   upright .   seriously ,   what   s   the   point   of   having   a   duck   if   it   can   only   lay   on   it   s   side  
my   daughter   loves   it !   this   is   such   a   great   way   to   decorate   a   child   s   room   without   the   hassle   of   painting .   knowing   my   daughters   taste   will   change   over   the   years ,   this   is   a   convenient   way   of   decorating   and   then   changing   the   design   when   needed .
life   saver   i   have   the   older   version   of   this   swing   for   my   1st   boyy ,   who   is   now   5   years   old .   i   used   it   for   my   2nd   and   now   for   my   3rd   child !   i   must   say   it   is   very   durable ,   i   brought   the   swing   along   with   me   to   overseas ,   and   several   cities   in   my   luggage   taking   apart   and   utting   them   back   together ,   by   myself   with   a   small   screw ,   which   takes   only   a   few   mnutes ! ! !   .   i   bought   3   others   as   gifts .   my   2.5   years   old   still   wants   to   sleep   in   this ,   then   i   transfer   him   to   his   bed .   such   a   life   saver .
great   for   wide   gaps   my   daughter   hates   it .   she   can   t   get   past   it .   now   we   have   peace   of   mind   knowing   that   she   won   t   get   under   our   feet   in   the   kitchen .   great   should   have   bought   it   sooner .
great   patterns   for   options   carrier   i   purchased   the   ergo   options   carrier   just   so   i   could   have   the   option   to   change   the   covers .   this   set   is   really   cute   and   i   can   t   wait   to   use   it !
pleased   grandma   i   ordered   this   stroller   for   my   grandaughter   and   she   loves   it .   the   hood   and   extra   pouch   was   a   nice   touch   but   i   really   like   the   idea   of   having   the   basket   underneath   to   carry   the   diaper   bag .   this   is   a   light   weight   easy   to   use   especially   lifting   in   and   out   of   the   car   umbrella   stroller   with   the   conveinances   of   a   large   stroller .   the   only   complant   i   might   have   is   that   the   backrest   could   be   just   a   little   higher   but   it   still   works   fine .   grandmas   if   you   want   an   easy   stroller   for   your   grandkids   this   is   the   one   to   have .

i   love   love   love   it !   i   purchased   this   item   for   my   best   friend .   its   perfect   for   someone   seeking   an   smaller   alternative   to   a   crib ,   because   it   looks   and   acts   as   one .   the   shipment   came   exactly   on   time ,   i   loved   the   whole   process   and   the   bassinet .   great   purchase !
great   cups   so   i   bought   these   in   blue   too   and   had   issues   with   the   opening   snaps   being   too   difficult   to   open   for   the   kids .   these   ones   were   easier ..... kids   had   no   problems   opening   these   ones .   maybe   it   s   just   a   hit   or   miss .... maybe   the   blue   lids   will   get   easier   to   open   with   time .... dunno .   still   very   happy   with   product .
very   high   quality   love   all   the   trend   lab   items   got   these   burp   clothes   in   addition   to   the   towel   and   wash   clothes .   they   are   high   quality   good   absorbancy   and   we   ve   washed   them   several   times   and   they   have   held   up   very   well .   very   cute .   also   more   than   enough   to   clean   up   spit   ups .
fun   toy   for   baby   yes ,   the   other   reviews   are   correct   that   the   toy   received   is   not   exactly   as   pictured .   instead   my   panda   is   in   the   middle   and   the   pattern   is   slightly   different ,   but   all   in   all ,   it   s   the   same .   my   son   loves   playing   with   this   blankie   and   likes   holding   onto   the   panda .   i   bought   one   for   my   friend   s   baby   too   because   i   like   it   so   much !
too   much   wing   droop   for   my   skinny   the   inside   is   soooooooo   soft .   i   really   like   this   diaper   but   there   is   just   way   too   much   wing   droop .   my   daughter   is   32inches   and   20lbs   with   a   tiny   waist .   i   have   to   snap   in   on   the   4th   button   for   her   and   the   wings   hang   out   the   side .   i   find   it   to   big   in   the   waist   to   really   love .   also   its   not   very   trim   between   the   legs .   other   than   that   i   love   the   softness ,   the   gussets ,   and   its   extremely   well   made .
great   sunglasses   for   baby   these   sunglasses   worked   great .   it   took   a   little   time   to   adjust   them   to   the   perfect   fit .   on   that   note   we   love   that   they   are   adjustable   since   every   little   baby   is   different .
portable   chair   this   purchase   arrived   quickly   and   in   perfect   condition .   it   is   easy   to   assemble   and   adjusts   to   fit   different   tables .   te   children   enjoy   sitting   up   to   the   table   to   enjoy   their   meal   with   the   family .   br   excellent   investment !
excellent   waterproof   pad   i   bought   this   pad   to   protect   our   bedding   from   all   the   spit   up ,   diaper   leaks ,   and   you   name   it   that   comes   from   a   baby .   after   reading   the   many   reviews   about   the   product   material   pilling ,   i   was   a   bit   concerned   but   decided   to   buy   it   and   see   for   myself .   i   ended   up   buying   3   continental   quilting   waterproof   pads   to   have   around   the   house   and   also   for   back   up   so   i   d   always   have   a   clean   one   if   the   others   got   dirty .   boy   am   i   happy   with   this   product !   it   is   perfectly   sized ,   not   too   big ,   not   too   small ,   and   completely   waterproof   as   advertised .   i   ve   sent   mine   through   the   wash   plenty   of   times   and   i   m   happy   to   report   that   not   a   single   one   has   had   any   pilling   to   speak   of ,   considering   that   i   have   3   of   them   i   don   t   think   it   s   luck   of   the   draw   that   all   three   have   not   had   any   pilling .   the   fabric   is   not   very   soft   however   i   just   put   a   thin   blanket   over   the   pad   so   that   my   daughter   is   only   in   direct   contact   with   the   blanket   covering   the   pad .   love   this   pad !
perfect   dinnerware   set   i   have   two   kids   and   they   both   love   to   use   this   set .   lots   of   colors   pictures   to   look   at   and   also   helps   remind   me   to   make   sure   they   are   eating   a   well   balanced   meal .   the   cup   and   utensils   are   perfect   size   for   them   to   hold   onto !
a   must   for   eating   out !   this   chair   is   amazing !   we   started   using   this   for   our   son   when   he   was   about   6   months   old .   it   is   useful   for   many   reasons   br   1 .   your   baby   can   sit   at   your   level   with   you   when   you   eat .   br   2 .   the   chair   cradles   the   baby   most   high   chairs   for   kids ,   especially   when   they   are   young ,   are   way   too   big   .   we   were   not   worried   that   he   would   fall   back   in   the   chair   and   we   didn   t   have   to   support   him   with   blankets   like   we   usually   do .   br   3 .   maybe   most   important   you   don   t   have   to   worry   about   your   baby   hitting   their   face   on   the   table   or   using   the   table   as   a   chew   toy   .   br   4 .   very   portable   to   leave   in   the   car   and   use   when   you   go   out   to   eat .   br   5 .   very   good   quality .   extremely   sturdy .
great   for   the   price   easy   to   assemble .   sturdy   and   well   made .   i   am   going   to   put   cushions   on   the   top   to   double   as   extra   seating   in   my   office   craft   room .   i   bought   two   and   love   them .
not   all   it   s   cracked   up   to   be ...   i   did   so   much   research   on   the   double   strollers   and   found   that   the   valco   zee   2   had   all   that   i   wanted .   however ,   when   i   received   it   i   was   a   bit   disappointed .   the   hoods ,   although   they   cover   a   lot   of   area ,   felt   very   flimsy   and   seemed   to   be   made   of   cheap   material .   also ,   i   didn   t   like   the   way   it   didn   t   stay   folded   in   when   not   in   use ,   it   looked   sloppy .   the   main   reason   i   ended   up   returning   it   was   because   of   the   way   the   stroller   folded .   it   did   not   fold   easy   at   all .   i   had   to   push   it   down   really   hard   in   order   to   get   it   to   collapse .   and   sometimes   it   wouldn   t   even   fold   at   all .   i   m   used   to   the   baby   jogger   city   mini   which   folds   incredibly   easy ,   so   this   was   very   difficult .   therefore ,   i   opted   to   return   it   will   be   ordering   the   baby   jogger   city   mini   double   when   it   comes   out   in   a   few   weeks .   br   i   did   give   it   2   stars   because   the   stroller   was   very   easy   to   maneuver   with   my   2   kids   in   it   and   the   basket   was   huge   very   accessible .   unfortunately ,   i   just   couldn   t   get   past   the   difficulty   in   folding   the   stroller .
amazing   mh   daughter   started   teething   hard   core   br   at   about   3   months .   i   purchased   the   giraffe   teething   toy   and   it   was   huge   for   her   little   mouth .   fell   across   this   one   while   searching   and   purchase   it .   absolutely   amazing .   she   s   almost   5   month   and   absolutely   loves   it   still .   there   s   always   a   place   for   her   to   chew   on .   it   s   easy   to   hold   and   clean .   having   dogs   makes   keeping   things   smelling   good   hard   but   the   scent   on   this   toy   doesn   t   go   away   awesome   teething   toy
baby   loves   ronronos   i   got   ronoronos   at   a   half   off   deal   four   months   ago ,   when   my   baby   was   four   months   old .   it   was   a   hit   from   day   one .   he   loves   the   ring   the   best ,   especially   now   that   he   s   teething ,   but   i   have   noticed   that   he   also   likes   to   chew   a   little   on   the   softer   legs   too .   one   leg   has   a   squeaker   in   the   heel , another   leg   is   a   rattle ,   and   another   leg   is   just   plain .   the   tail   pulls   for   the   vibration   feature ,   which   always   makes   my   son   smile .   br   br   this   is   a   pricey   toy   and   not   machine   washable ,   but   we   love   it .
our   doctor   recommended   against   i   received   this   product   as   a   gift ,   and   before   ever   using   it ,   showed   it   to   our   baby   s   doctor .   he   was   appalled   and   told   begged   me   to   never   use   it .   the   insertion   tip   is   too   long   and   can   cause   tears   in   the   baby   s   rectum .   i   realize   so   many   other   reviewers   found   relief   for   their   babies   in   pain ,   but   i   wanted   to   pass   on   what   our   doctor   recommended   and   suggest   that   before   using ,   please   check   with   your   own   doctor .
great   chair   i   love   this   seat .   my   daughter   is   2   1   2   and   still   uses   it   for   every   meal .   we   do   not   travel   with   it .   we   use   it   clamped   to   our   breakfast   bar   instead   of   a   big   ugly   plastic   highchair .   best   of   all ,   since   it   doesn   t   look   like   a   baby   chair   she   is   still   willing   to   sit   in   it   and   cannot   escape   during   dinner .   i   am   about   to   buy   another   one   for   my   9   month   old .   highly   recommended .
way   too   flimsy   horrible !   i   purchased   this   gate   to   put   at   the   top   of   my   stairs ,   which   are   34   wide .   since   this   products   states   that   it   fits   doorways   that   are   29   40   wide ,   i   figured ,   no   problem !   wrong !   the   34   is   just   a   bit   too   narrow   to   use   the   extension   for   the   gate ,   so   i   had   to   extend   the   screws   fully   out   from   the   gate   to   make   it   fit   about   4   5   of   screw   on   each   side   .   this   made   the   gate   incredibly   flimsy   and   shaky .   i   am   returning   the   gate ,   which   is   frustrating   after   putting   4   holes   in   my   wall !
great   for   restaurant   high   chairs !   i   ve   only   used   this   on   restaurant   high   chairs   so   far ,   but   it   s   been   great .   my   son   is   big   for   his   age   and   started   sitting   up   on   his   own   at   about   4.5   months ,   but   we   still   thought   he   was   too   small   to   comfortably   sit   in   a   wooden   high   chair .   a   friend   recommended   this   cart   cover ,   so   we   got   it   and   we   love   it !   it   s   so   soft   and   plush   that   he   is   very   comfortable ,   and   now   he   can   sit   at   the   restaurant   table   with   us   while   we   eat .   before ,   my   husband   and   i   would   each   have   to   take   turns   holding   him   and   eating   since   he   hated   sitting   in   his   car   seat   or   a   stroller   at   a   restaurant .   br   br   before   we   bought   this   one ,   we   checked   out   other ,   less   expensive   covers .   we   re   happy   we   got   this   one   because   it   has   the   following   advantages   br   1 .   it   is   very   soft   and   plush   as   i   said   before   ,   so   it   pads   the   seat   a   bit   for   your   little   one .   br   2 .   it   straps   to   the   chair ,   and   has   its   own   little   strap   that   holds   the   child   in   it   s   like   a   little   triangle   shaped   piece   of   fabric   that   you   put   his   feet   through   and   straps   around   his   waist ,   so   it   really   keeps   him   in   there !   i   ve   seen   toddlers   crawl   out   of   restaurant   high   chairs   and   onto   the   table ,   so   i   think   this   feature   would   come   in   handy   for   children   older   than   mine ,   too   .   br   3 .   the   tags !   our   baby   loves   them .   we   also   use   them   as   loops   to   attach   links   asin   b001abzgu2   bright   starts   lots   of   links   and   toys   for   our   son .   br   br   the   main   disadvantage   to   this   cart   cover   is   that   it   s   kind   of   big .   that   s   no   big   deal   when   we   re   taking   it   out   in   the   car ,   but   we   like   to   walk   places   too .   so ,   we   purchased   a   4l   stuff   sack   asin   b000sthhqi   sea   to   summit   ultra   sil   stuff   sack   ,   size   s   for   it ,   which   makes   it   small   enough   to   squeeze   into   the   diaper   bag   when   we   re   walking   out   for   dinner .   i   d   recommend   getting   one   if   you   re   a   walker   too !   br   br   we   love   our   cart   cover !   i   m   sure   it   will   be   great   when   we   use   it   on   an   actual   cart ,   too  
excellent   i   received   this   item   fairly   quickly   and   it   was   still   in   its   original   wrapping .   i   am   very   positively   impressed   with   this   purchase .   highly   recommend !   thank   you  
baby   adores   this   this   is   one   of   the   best   12   bucks   i   have   ever   spent   in   my   life .   my   baby   simply   adores   this   toy .   i   never   thought   he   will   hang   on   to   any   toy   for   so   long .   it   has   been   4   months   since   i   got   this   my   baby   is   7   months   now   and   this   is   still   his   favorite .   the   designer   of   the   toy   has   been   so   thoughtful   of   the   colors ,   patterns ,   fabric   material   etc   so   well .   my   baby   has   got   amused   with   every   little   thing   dangling   from   the   toy   even   today .   he   looks   at   it   as   if   he   is   looking   at   it   for   the   very   first   time .   love   it   when   i   see   my   baby   get   amused .
gorgeous   diaper   bag !   spending   this   kind   of   money   on   a   diaper   bag ,   even   on   sale ,   was   a   tough   decision   for   me .   i   finally   caved   because   with   a   toddler   and   a   newborn   on   the   way ,   i   didn   t   want   to   mess   with   an   inferior   bag   and   end   up   replacing   it .   when   this   bag   arrived ,   i   was   pleased   with   the   quality   of   the   construction   as   well   as   the   lovely   fabric .   i   ve   just   begun   to   use   it ,   but   i   think   it   will   last   very   well .   the   pockets   make   the   bag   very   easy   to   organize   and   the   removable   dirty   diaper   pouch   and   changing   pad   are   brilliant   add   ons .   definitely   glad   i   made   the   investment !
good   product   but   just   for   a   few   months   so   far   we   have   it   since   my   son   was   like   10   months   and   now   he   is   14   months   it   has   worked   pretty   good .   i   wonder   how   helpful   this   will   be   once   my   son   is   a   little   bit   older   18   months   or   so   .   br   update   as   i   presumed ,   this   product   was   great   but   just   for   a   little   while .   my   now   15   old   months   old   figured   out   how   to   get   rid   of   it   a   month   ago .   as   i   said   before , ,   good   product   but   just   for   a   litle   while ...
cute   patterns ,   cheap   material   i   did   about   8   hours   of   research   to   find   a   reusable   diaper   brand   that   i   thought   would   be   the   most   cost   effective ,   efficient   and   environmentally   friendly .   that   being   said   i   eventually   settled   on   best   bottoms   but   i   wanted   to   try   this   brand   of   shell   because   the   pattern   was   so   cute .   upon   receiving   the   item   and   comparing   it   to   the   asin   b005bekux2   new   bestbottom   best   bottom   one   size   cloth   diapers   best   bottom   shells   i   already   own   there   was   absolutely   no   comparison .   same   price   for   both   but   the   best   bottom   shell   is   1 , 000   times   better   in   quality .   not   to   mention   that   the   best   bottoms   have   the   snaps   on   the   inside   of   the   shell   so   as   to   allow   for   more   variation   of   insert   to   be   used .   wish   this   review   could   have   been   more   positive   but   save   yourself   the   hassle   and   buy   best   bottoms .
love   it   soft ,   beautiful ,   cozy   and   a   great   purple !   br   br   bought   as   a   gift   for   my   baby   to   be ! !   br   br   i   definitely   recommend   this   as   a   great   blanket   for   kids !   they   love   the   softness   and   the   silky   border !
ok   for   the   price .   this   may   was   just   okay   for   the   price .   the   blanket   was   very   soft ,   however   there   was   almost   no   padding   in   the   mat ,   i   wouldnt   even   say   it   was   a   half   inch   thick .   i   spent   more   than   the   mat   cost   buying   extra   quilt   batting   and   material   to   make   it   thicker .
great   cup ,   but   you   need   replacement   spouts   my   son   stopped   taking   bottles   when   he   was   about   2   months   old ,   so   we   decided   to   introduce   a   sippy   cup   around   4.5   months .   although   this   product   says   6   months ,   it   s   similar   to   others   that   are   labelled   4   months ,   so   we   tried   it   anyway .   this   is   his   favorite   sippy   cup !   he   took   right   to   it   and   now   it   s   our   first   choice   when   feeding   him   his   second   favorite   is   a   asin   b000rqubag   playtex   baby   the   first   sipster   spill   proof   7   oz   cup   boy   colors   .   br   br   we   really   like   the   cup   too   and   think   it   has   may   advantages   over   his   other   cups   br   1 .   it   s   only   five   ounces .   we   re   feeding   him   breast   milk   from   it ,   so   the   smaller   size   is   better   since   we   only   feed   him   2   3   ounces   per   feeding .   br   2 .   it   has   a   cap .   no   matter   how   spill   proof   a   cup   is ,   they   all   tend   to   drip   a   little ,   especially   if   they   re   dropped   or   transported   with   liquid   in   them .   this   cup   also   comes   with   an   insert   to   go   under   the   spout   like   the   kind   that   come   in   bottles   ,   so   the   sippy   cup   has   two   ways   to   keep   it   from   leaking   while   transporting ,   on   top   of   the   spill   proof   spout .   br   3 .   the   handles   project   from   the   bottom   of   the   cup   instead   of   the   top ,   which   seems   better   for   my   son   s   little   hands .   also ,   the   handles   are   removable ,   which   makes   it   easier   to   transport   the   cup   in   a   bottle   cooler .   you   can   also   tilt   the   handles   a   bit   by   attaching   them   at   an   angle ,   which   can   help   your   child   drink   e . g .   if   the   handles   are   at   an   angle ,   the   baby   can   hold   the   cup   so   that   the   handles   are   parallel   to   the   floor ,   but   the   angle   of   the   cup   is   tilted   towards   the   baby   s   mouth ,   helping   the   fluid   to   flow   more   easily   out   of   the   cup   .   br   4 .   the   pattern   is   great !   my   son   loves   to   look   at   this   cup .   br   br   the   big   disadvantage   of   the   cup   is   that   the   spout   is   flimsy .   my   son   doesn   t   have   any   teeth   yet   and ,   although   he   chomps   on   the   spout   a   little   with   his   gums ,   he   doesn   t   do   it   much .   he   s   only   used   this   sippy   cup   once   every   day   or   two   for   about   three   weeks   and   the   spout   already   broke .   i   ordered   replacement   spouts   asin   b004fpyg7o   nuk   replacement   silicone   spout ,   clear   ,   but   i   strongly   caution   you   to   check   the   spout   before   each   use .   the   part   that   broke   was   a   small   piece   bridging   the   multiple   holes   in   the   spout .   if   i   hadn   t   stopped   using   it   when   i   noticed   the   damage ,   i   worry   that   a   small   chunk   of   silicone   could   have   broken   off   and   my   son   would   have   swallowed   it .   it   probably   would   have   been   small   enough   to   cause   him   no   harm ,   but   i   still   don   t   want   pieces   of   silicone   in   my   baby   s   tummy ,   and   i   doubt   you   would   either !   br   br   still ,   the   cup   is   great   and   my   son   loves   it .   if   you   get   this   cup ,   i   kindly   ask   that   you   please   buy   replacement   spouts   rather   than   buying   a   new   cup   each   time   a   spout   breaks   let   s   try   to   keep   these   cups   out   of   landfills !  
great   product   i   purchased   this   as   a   baby   gift   for   my   grandson   and   my   daughter   just   loves   it   she   does   not   have   any   negative   comments   at   all .   sure   wish   there   was   these   products   when   i   had   my   children .   the   screen   is   very   clear   and   the   sound   is   great .   all   in   all   a   great   product   and   would   recommend   it .   asin   b004e9swq2   angelcare   4   piece   baby   video   sound   and   movement   baby   monitor   system   ac1100 ,   gray   white  
still   unsure   about   this   item   i   was   the   mom   that   was   worried   about   flat   head   syndrome ,   especially   for   my   little   girl   who   i   wanted   to   grow   up   with   a   perfectly   shaped   head .   br   i   purchased   this   pillow ,   after   talking   with   my   friend   who   recommended   it .   it   s   quite   pricey   for   what   it   is   but   i   figured   how   could   i   put   a   price   on   having   a   nice   shaped   head   for   my   baby .   br   br   as   a   small   infant ,   i   bought   this   when   she   was   about   2   months   old ,   she   didn   t   like   it   very   much   and   would   wake   up   when   we   would   put   her   on   it .   it   took   some   time   for   her   to   get   used   to   it .   i   only   used   it   for   about   a   month   or   two   until   she   could   start   rolling   over   and   i   guess   it   helped   the   shape .   i   wasn   t   that   great   with   making   her   do   tummy   time   as   a   newborn ,   but   eventually   they   get   better   at   it   and   because   i   thought   i   didn   t   do   enough   tummy   time ,   that   probably   added   to   me   making   the   decision   to   get   this   pillow .   br   br   the   back   of   her   head   isn   t   flat   but   my   husband   who   is   very   observant   thinks   this   pillow   made   a   different   shape   to   her   head .   the   shape   of   a   baby   head   that   was   in   a   donut   shape ...   i   can   t   really   describe   what   shape   that   is ....   i   see   what   he   is   saying   but   its   better   than   a   flat   back   of   the   head   and   i   know   now   that   she   s   6   months   old   and   sleeping   all   over   the   crib   in   various   positions ,   i   think   her   head   would   have   rounded   out   on   its   own   anyway .   br   br   this   is   not   a   must   have   item   in   my   opinion .   its   a   good   to   have   item   if   you   are   paranoid   about   the   shape   of   your   baby   s   head ,   but   i   think   what   the   books   and   dr   s   say   is   true   unless   the   baby   only   likes   to   sleep   on   his   her   back   even   as   older   kids ,   they   will   eventually   round   out   their   head   anyway .   but   if   you   talk   to   my   friend   she   would   tell   you   to   buy   two   but   her   baby   s   head   isn   t   perfectly   shaped   either .   i   see   the   shape   my   husband   refers   to   as   looks   like   its   been   in   the   donut   shape   more   prominently   on   my   friends   baby   s   head ...
great   seat   i   was   worried   about   getting   this   vs .   the   more   expensive   cushee ,   but   am   glad   i   didn   t   fork   out   the   extra   money .   this   seat   is   very   durable ,   doesn   t   tip   over   no   matter   how   weirdly   my   son   climbs   in   ,   cleans   easily   and   looks   good   too .   highly   recommended .
great   cover !   fits   perfectly   on   our   britax   seat   and   it   comes   off   so   easy   to   clean .   i   would   definitely   recommend   this   product .
great   purchase   i   bought   this   stroller   as   a   happy   medium   between   an   umbrella   stroller   and   a   full   size   stroller   and   so   far   i   am   very   happy   with   the   purchase .   i   was   debating   on   this   stroller   and   the   city   mini   because   they   seem   pretty   comparable .   i   decided   on   this   one   over   the   citi   mini   because   it   wad   50   cheaper   and   i   liked   that   this   one   could   work   as   a   travel   system   if   necessary .   we   haven   t   used   it   for   that   function   but   have   been   using   it   for   our   3   year   old   and   also   have   a   6   month   old   who   will   also   use   it .   what   i   like   most   about   this   stroller   is   that   it   is   still   light   weight   like   an   umbrella   stroller   but   it   is   so   much   more   maneuverable .   this   stroller   pushes   very   easily   and   is   great   to   take   on   walks   and   shopping .   overall   i   am   very   happy   with   the   purchase .
a   monitor   the   monitor   shipped   quickly   and   description   was   very   accurate .   the   monitor   it   the   best   i   have   used   so   far   the   screen   quality   is   excellent   when   the   lights   are   on   how   ever   when   all   the   lights   r   off   or   if   there   s   no   night   light   it   s   hard   to   see   the   image   of   the   child   but   since   we   are   scared   of   monster   lol   that   s   no   problem   for   us !   i   wish   they   would   add   a   facebook   or   internet   option   so   if   i   wanted   to   upload   it   to   facebook   i   could ...   i   love   the   face   it   has   the   scan   feature   .   i   have   2   kids   in   the   room   and   i   can   go   from   one   bed   to   the   next   in   a   quick   second .   over   all   i   love   this   monitor   and   i   would   recomind   it   to   friends ! ! ! !
keeps   pets   out !   i   have   now   purchased   this   gate   three   times !   once   as   a   gift   and   twice   for   myself .   when   we   initially   tried   to   install   the   gate ,   we   couldn   t   get   it   to   latch   together .   we   thought   it   was   defective   and   needed   to   be   returned .   that   was   not   the   case !   they   actually   have   a   paper   that   says   there   is   a   gap   i   can   t   remember   the   reason   and   they   tell   you   how   to   fix   it .   if   we   had   read   the   paperwork   carefully ,   we   would   have   known   this   from   the   start .   unfortunately ,   we   have   not   had   to   use   the   extensions   so   i   cannot   review   the   extension   at   this   time .   also ,   i   cannot   review   this   product   in   terms   of   a   toddler .   we   are   currently   using   it   to   keep   pets   out   of   bedrooms   as   we   don   t   have   doors   on   the   hinges   right   now .   we   have   had   no   problems   passing   through   these   gates   late   at   night   without   lights   and   i   do   imagine   this   will   make   an   excellent   gate   whenever   we   eventually   have   children .   the   height   is   very   nice .   we   had   a   wooden   gate   but   our   little   yorkie   was   able   to   jump   high   enough   to   pull   herself   over   the   gate .   the   wooden   gate   also   had   places   where   i   felt   she   could   get   her   little   claws   paws   caught ,   which   is   not   the   case   with   this   gate .   we   this   gate   daily   and   have   had   no   problems   with   the   latches   or   anything   else !
cocalo   sugar   night   light   excellent   product   ... looks   nicer   when   you   recieve   it   than   online !   our   granddaughter   loves   it ! !   br   it   is   made   of   ceramic   material   and   is   easy   to   turn   on .
great   for   cleaning   momma   bottles   i   have   a   regular   bottle   brush ,   but   this   one   is   specific   for   the   momma   bottles   and   works   great .   only   complaint   is   that   it   is   so   wide   that   it   doesn   t   fit   in   my   medela   storage   capsules .   otherwise ,   great   product .
worked   for   us   our   daughter ,   who   was   breastfed   but   drank   pumped   milk   from   a   bottle   occasionally ,   suddenly   decided   she   would   not   drink   take   a   bottle   anymore   at   3   months   which   was   putting   a   lot   of   pressure   on   her   mother .   normally   a   calm   baby ,   she   would   go   into   hysterics   if   you   tried   to   give   her   a   silicone   nipple .   out   of   desperation   we   tried   these .   she   was   less   apprehensive   on   the   first   try   and   by   the   second   evening   she   was   happy   to   take   a   bottle   with   the   nuk   nipple .   we   are   happy   with   them ,   but   i   understand   they   do   not   make   the   size   2   in   this   design   anymore ,   so   we   ll   have   to   see   how   she   reacts   to   a   different   nipple   as   she   gets   older .
a   little   disappointed   with   the   battery   life   we   were   excited   to   purchase   the   product   after   reading   about   such   good   reviews   on   it .   in   general   we   are   happy   with   all   of   it   s   functions .   our   only   problem   is   that   the   battery   seems   to   die   out   fairly   fast .   we   did   everything   according   to   the   instruction   manual   charging   it   fully   before   use ,   draining   it   each   time ,   etc   etc   ,   and   still   it   seems   like   the   battery   is   only   good   for   one   use   for   the   entire   day .   br   br   that   s   the   only   thing   i   would   wish   they   would   improve   about   the   product ,   otherwise   it   serves   its   purpose   well .
good   for   short   younger   babies   bought   this   when   baby   was   3   months   old .   we   used   a   blanket   rolled   up   on   her   sides .   she   is   now   9   months   and   the   walker   is   too   short .   she   is   only   29   inches .   she   was   able   to   break   on   of   the   giraffes   off   the   plastic   when   she   pulled   it   about   a   month   ago .   but   we   still   put   her   in   it   and   she   will   stand   and   walk .   sometimes   it   looks   like   she   may   topple   over   when   reaching   for   something   since   the   stroller   is   short .
soft   and   beautiful   i   was   looking   for   a   blanket   that   was   soft   and   warm ,   yet   not   too   warm .   i   also   wanted   one   that   was   feminine   with   a   classic   look .   that   s   exactly   what   i   got   when   i   received   this   blanket .   it   s   perfect .
cute   and   oh ,   so   functional !   my   grandson ,   who   is   now   5   months   old ,   cannot   be   far   from   his   pacifier   when   he   is   tired ... it   calms   him   and   off   he   goes   to   zzzzz !   this   is   a   wonderful   item .... he   has   two   other   animals ..... i   love   it   because   it   is   easily   found .... and   it   is   machine   washable !   now   that   he   is   a   little   older ,   he   can   put   it   in   his   mouth   himself !   one   caution !   the   puppy   i   got   was   not   brown ,   it   was   a   gold   color ... but   i   didn   t   care !
momma   bear   we   have   loved   thr   momma   bear   since   my   son   was   a   baby   now   we   love   giving   it   as   a   gift .   i   m   glad   amazon   has   them !
great   invention ! !   geez !   this   is   so   ridiculously   simple   why   didn   t   i   think   of   it   !   br   br   great   for   attaching   teething   rings   and   any   type   of   hanging   baby   toy   that   has   a   ring   on   it .   keep   in   mind ,   it   s   not   like   a   pacifier   clip   that   you   can   literally   clip   to   your   baby   s   outfit .   it   has   to   be   snapped   onto   a   carrier   handle ,   car   seat   stroller   strap ,   etc .   so   if   you   re   carrying   your   baby   around   it   won   t   work   like   the   binky   clips   do .   br   br   for   that   reason   only ,   i   gave   it   4   stars .
a   real   lifesaver .   this   is   the   second   one   of   these   we   have   purchased   and   they   are   both   great   products .   would   definitely   recommend   purchasing .   they   are   nice   because   i   don   t   know   how   many   pacis   we   have   lost   but   these   are   pretty   hard   to   lose   track   of .
best   paci   s   ever ! !   we   bought   tons   of   nuk   pacifiers   for   our   baby   and   they   were   fine ... until   one   day   when   i   picked   her   up   at   daycare ,   the   woman   told   me   she   had   the   best   nap   she   had   ever   had   there   slept   for   hours   for   the   first   time   .   ok   this   might   be   gross   and   unhygienic   but   our   daughter   picked   up   another   baby   s   paci   and   immediately   calmed   down   and   went   to   sleep   it   was   a   mam   .   what !   that   night   i   ordered   these   on   amazon   and   we   will   never   ever   use   another   brand   of   paci .   she   loves   them .   i   have   no   idea   what   it   was ... but   these   things   are   awesome .   right   around   when   we   got   her   these   she   started   sleeping   through   the   night   i   can   t   directly   contribute   it   to   these   but   i   can   t   discount   it   either   .   i   m   a   little   bummed   because   i   have   a   pile   of   literally   20   nuks   that   i   am   just   going   to   end   up   throwing   away   but   sleep   is   worth   it   as   you   other   mommies   know  
love   mams !   i   got   these   for   my   son   when   he   was   around   two   months .   prior   to   that   i   had   used   the   smaller   size   in   mams   mam   start   .   this   is   the   only   brand   our   son   likes ,   when   i   would   give   him   a   different   brand   he   would   just   spit   it   out .   i   love   the   cute   designs ,   although   it   says   colors   may   vary   and   we   were   sent   pink ,   oh   well !   i   also   got   the   mam   pacifier   clip .
secure   a   toy   a   must   have !   we   have   several   of   these   attached   to   everything   from   our   stroller ,   to   our   baby   carriers ,   to   shopping   carts   high   chairs .   our   son   seems   to   be   determined   to   throw   his   toys   everywhere   so   these   are   invaluable   to   us .   we   use   them   not   only   on   toys ,   but   also   on   snack   cups   and   anything   it   will   latch   on   to .
if   your   a   fan   this   is   one   team   my   fiancee   and   i   can   agree   on .   we   don   t   have   a   baby   yet   but   wanted   to   make   sure   we   got   the   deal   on   them   now .
so   so   my   two   year   old   can   undo   the   snaps   so   its   not   very   effective   for   him .   it   works   great   for   my   3   month   old   though .   sometimes   he   holds   onto   it   instead   of   his   toy .   i   like   that   its   much   more   stream   lined   then   using   those   plastic   links .
he   loved   this   mattress ! ! !   my   7   month   old   boy   loved   this   mattress .   he   was   having   difficulty   getting   comfortable   enough   to   sleep   through   the   night ,   waking   up   constantly .   the   graco   play   pen   i   bought   him   had   a   hard   and   thin   mattress .   i   began   to   compare   different   items   online   by   reading   others   reviews   and   came   across   the   dream   on   me   mattress .   when   i   first   placed   the   mattress   down   he   was   happy   stomping   his   feet   on   it   trying   to   walk   around   he   liked   the   feeling   of   it   on   his   feet .   and   by   the   miracle   of   god   he   fell   asleep   through   the   entire   night   and   morning .   it   s   soft   but   firm   enough .
serves   the   purpose   this   product   works   great   for   keeping   children   s   hands   and   puppy   paws   from   tearing   screens !   it   is   very   flimsy   but   sturdy   when   secured   it   works   well
no   spills !   this   is   the   only   sippy   i   ve   found   that   actually   works !   the   valve   has   to   be   replaced   after   a   few   months ,   but   you   can   buy   refills   easily .   hurray !
great   mobile   changing   station   this   is   a   great   changing   pad .   it   closes   up   to   easily   fit   in   a   diaper   bag   or   large   purse   ,   has   room   for   wet   wipes ,   diapers   etc .   and   can   quickly   and   easily   be   wiped   clean .   i   highly   recommend   it   and   the   color   choices   are   terrific
great   and   long   i   love   this   item .   my   son   is   super   tall   and   2 .   he   outgrew   halo   sacks   because   they   don   t   make   them   over   an   extra   large   and   i   hate   the   halo   toddler   sacks   because   they   are   fleece   polyester .   i   love   these   sacks   great   cotton   material   and   comes   in   longer   lengths .   i   also   bought   one   for   winter   but   haven   t   used   it   yet .   you   may   be   wondering   why   i   put   my   toddler   in   a   sack   still .   well ,   i   do   it   for   thee   reasons   he   is   used   to   it ,   it   guarantees   he   is   warm   if   he   moves   around   and   finally ,   he   can   t   crawl   or   fall   out   of   his   crib .   i   highly   recommend   this   item .
excellent   product   for   little   people   we   bought   one   of   these   before   for   our   2   year   old .   now   he   s   three   and   he   s   got   a   one   year   old   brother   so   we   bought   a   three   pack .   really   good   idea .
cute ,   best   for   dry   products   this   lunch   sack   is   really   cute   in   person .   it   wipes   clean   with   a   cloth   and   is   about   the   same   size   as   the   traditional   brown   paper   sack .   i   wouldn   t   recommend   it   for   any   kind   of   liquid ,   though .   sippy   cups   fit   fine ,   but   the   bag   is   difficult   to   clean   if   it   gets   wet   and   molds   really   quickly .   we   tried   it   twice   and   had   each   for   less   than   4   weeks .   would   be   great   for   an   older ,   dry   sack   lunch   think   pbj   and   an   apple   .
awesome   super   quick   to   ship !   my   son   used   it   until   he   was   10   months   old !   he   loved   it !   easy   to   clean ,   light   weight   and   easy   to   move   with   one   hand .   have   recommended   to   all   our   friends   who   are   new   parents .
great   product   love   them .   they   work   great   and   match   our   crib   and   crib   set .   great   value   for   you   money .   definitely   would   recommend   if   you   don   t   want   bite   marks   on   your   crib .
teether   this   teether   is   cute .   it   s   not   super   soft ,   but   sometimes   my   son   prefers   something   harder   to   chew   on   while   teething   than   a   really   squishy   teether .   it   s   also   fun   becaus   it   doubles   as   a   rattle .
love   love   love   this   swing !   we   initially   weren   t   going   to   buy   a   swing   ourselves   since   my   sister   in   law   gave   us   a   swing   just   the   plain   kind   they   sit   up   in   ,   a   bouncer   and   a   glider ..   well   our   baby   didn   t   like   any   of   them   at   first .   we   had   bought   the   same   snug   a   bunny   rock   n   play   sleeper   for   him   and   he   loved   it   so   i   decided   to   buy   this   and   give   it   a   try ...   he   loved   it !   this   swing   has   been   a   godsent ,   he   always   takes   the   best   naps   in   it   and   i   love   that   you   can   set   it   to   lay   down   or   sit   up .   was   easy   enough   to   set   up   and   looks   super   comfy ,   i   wish   they   would   make   them   in   adult   size .   anyway   if   your   on   the   fence   i   would   definitly   buy   this ,   it   s   awesome   and   all   the   other   moms   i   know   who   have   this   love   it   too .
a   must   have   for   twins !   oh   my   goodness ! ! !   this   stroller   is   amazing ! ! ! !   we   have   been   able   to   use   this   stroller   using   the   carseat   adapters   since   we   brought   our   twins   home !   everywhere   we   go ,   if   it   s   not   a   comment   about   our   twins ,   it   s   a   comment   on   how   cool   our   stroller   is .   this   stroller   can   fit   through   practically   any   door ,   it   fits   in   the   trunk   of   my   08   jetta ,   it   turns   on   a   dime ,   and   it   opens   and   closes   soooo   easily !   i   will   say ,   i   really   had   a   hard   time   removing   the   carseat   adapters   when   breaking   down   the   stroller   in   the   beginning   but   the   plastic   has   since   softened   with   use   and   is   much   easier .   br   i   would   recommend   this   stroller   to   anyone   with   twins   or   even   parents   with   two   young   kids !   enjoy !
best   stroller   option   for   a   newborn   if   you   have   chicco   carseat   i   m   so   glad   that   i   got   this   caddy   to   use   as   our   main   car   seat   stroller   for   my   son   for   the   first   few   months   of   his   life .   originally   i   was   thinking   of   buying   a   34   travel   system   34   consisting   of   a   full   size   stroller ,   plus   a   car   seat   ..   after   testing   them   out   i   decided   to   get   the   caddy   instead ,   and   have   been   totally   happy   with   my   purchase .   here   s   what   s   so   great   about   it   it   s   super   lightweight   and   portable   very   easy   to   fold   up   and   store   in   the   car ,   then   open   up   and   pop   baby   in   and   out   without   waking   him ,   etc .   when   running   around   town   running   errands .   handling   is   very   good   and   it   s   actually   pretty   versatile ,   more   versatile   than   you   might   think   given   how   lightweight   portable   it   is .   it   s   definitely   not   an   all   terrain   stroller   the   wheels   aren   t   large   or   robust   enough   ,   but   we   took   it   on   some   walks   on   mostly   flat   dirt   trails   nothing   too   bumpy   crazy   ,   and   it   held   up   just   fine .   storage   basket   is   pretty   darn   generous   for   such   a   lightweight   stroller .   it   s   no   uppababy   vista   or   anything ,   but   it   s   plenty   large   for   a   diaper   bag   or   groceries .   it   s   pretty   easy   to   access   too .   you   may   also   be   considering   the   snap   n   go   generic   caddy   stroller ,   especially   because   it   s   so   much   cheaper   than   the   chicco .   i   struggled   with   the   same   thing ,   and   am   so   glad   that   in   the   end   i   bought   the   chicco   caddy   made   specifically   for   chicco   carseats .   the   chicco   carseat   audibly   snaps   into   the   chicco   caddy   and   is   much   more   securely   attached   than   it   would   be   on   the   snap   n   go   where   there   is   no   34   click ,   34   and   you   are   supposed   to   manually   close   a   strap   over   the   carseat   every   time   you   attach   it   .   otherwise ,   i   found   the   two   stroller   caddies   to   be   pretty   similar ,   in   terms   of   ride   handling ,   quality   materials ,   etc .   but   the   greater   security   safety   convenience   not   having   to   use   the   strap   of   the   chicco   caddy   were   good   enough   reasons   for   me   to   spring   for   it .   if   you   have   a   chicco   keyfit   car   seat ,   and   you   plan   to   do   a   lot   of   in   out   of   the   car ,   then   i   would   definitely   recommend   that   you   get   a   caddy   ...   and   this   is   the   best   one   available   for   chicco   carseats .   the   only   time   i   wouldn   t   recommend   that   you   get   a   caddy   is   if   you   are   primarily   going   to   be   strolling   from   home ,   and   or   you   really   need   an   all   terrain   stroller .   in   those   cases ,   by   all   means   get   a   full   size   stroller   and   just   get   an   adapter   so   it   can   carry   your   keyfit .   but   for   most   people ,   i   think   this   would   be   a   totally   worthwhile   purchase   just   for   the   added   portability   convenience .   update   aug   2016   we   kept   this   stroller   around   and   just   finished   using   it   for   kid   2 .   she   was   tiny ,   so   is   still   in   her   infant   car   seat   at   15   months   !   ,   so   we   have   gotten   a   crapload   of   use   out   of   this   thing !   and   it   is   still   in   great   shape ,   totally   functional .   the   foam   surrounding   the   handlebar   is   not   as   squishy   as   it   was   when   we   first   bought   it   4.5   years   ago ,   but   otherwise   it   s   working   as   well   as   the   day   we   bought   it .   this   really   was   a   great   buy   for   us .
a   car   seat   saver !   a   must   have   for   potty   trainees .   we   have   extras ,   so   we   can   easily   swap   out   the   piddlepad   after   an   accident .   i   ve   heard   of   parents   using   plastic   bags ,   etc .   this   is   so   much   easier   and   very   inexpensive .   they   run   easily   through   the   wash   too   and   air   dry   in   no   time .   my   daughter   calls   it   her   mat   and   thinks   she   s   special   to   have   it .   i   can   t   imagine   she   d   feel   the   same   about   a   plastic   bag .   .   .
not   the   roomiest ,   but   very   functional   this   isn   t   the   roomiest   diaper   bag   but   it   has   great   functionality .   packing   the   pockets   on   the   inside   will   quickly   fill   the   diaper   bag ,   great   for   one   baby   for   everything   you   need   for   a   day   extra   clothes ,   diapers ,   bottles ,   pacifiers ,   bottles ,   etc .   .   although   if   you   have   more   than   one   baby   it   may   be   a   bit   tight   to   fit .   i   haven   t   used   the   bento   box ,   but   i   think   it   will   be   great   once   my   daughter   starts   solids   to   have   snacks   at   the   ready .   even   if   you   aren   t   using   the   bento   box   you   do   need   to   keep   it   in   the   bag   otherwise   it   will   not   stand   up .
fun   toy   my   12   week   old   is   still   a   little   young   to   press   the   buttons   and   enjoy   the   music ,   but   the   product   works   as   described   in   the   product   ad .   great   price .
no   leaks   these   are   basic   bottles ,   at   a   cheap   price .   they   have   a   slow   flow   nipple   that   vent   well ,   the   nipples   are   actually   different   colors   which   i   thought   was   really   cute .   i   bought   3   3packs   and   none   have   leaked   yet .   i   always   buy   the   asin   b000mqsjqo   nuby   2   pack   soft   sipper   replacement   spout ,   clear   for   transitioning   to   sippies   to   get   my   money   out   of   the   bottles   i   buy   and   these   fit   perfectly .
very   difficult   for   healing   mom .   my   wife   picked   out   this   stroller   for   our   twins .   the   stroller   wrks   fine   and   i   have   no   problems   with   it   once   it   is   opened .   when   i   am   not   around ,   though ,   this   stroller   could   hurt   my   wife .   this   thing   is   heavy .   it   is   especially   heavy   for   a   woman   who   has   reccently   given   birth .   my   wife   is   also   short .   my   biggest   issue   with   this   stroller   is   how   it   opens .   imagine   holding   your   hand   out ,   palm   down .   now   touch   your   fingertips   to   your   palm .   with   your   fingers   touching   your   palm   in   this   position   this   is   how   the   stroller   waits   to   be   opened .   imagine   this   pick   up   the   heavy ,   folder   strolller   out   of   the   minivan .   set   it   on   the   ground .   now   lift   the   handles ...   the   stroller   opens   away   from   you .   my   wife   literally   has   to   lift   the   entire   stroller   off   the   ground   while   opening   it .   it   says   it   is   spring   loaded   to   ease   opening   but   it   doesnt   help   her   at   all .   is   it   possible   we   are   doing   it   wrong   maybe .   but   i   don   t   think   so .   i   ve   read   the   manual .   when   it   closes   it   literally   is   pulled   away   from   you   about   five   feet .   pull   the   latch   and   guide   it   down ....   then   i   have   to   let   go   or   get   on   my   knees   and   follow   it .   i   have   come   to   hate   this   stroller   because   of   this .   br   br   as   far   as   a   wide   stroller   is   concerned ,   get   ready   for   difficulty   getting   into   and   out   of   many   stores .   we   have   found   that   it   is   very   difficult   to   navigate   a   wide   stroller   in   this   i   have   only   one   kid   world .
too   cute   for   words   but   pricey ...   love   this   towel .   our   son   is   7   months   old   and   it   s   the   perfect   size   for   him .   he   is   our   litter   dinosaur   so   we   found   this   towel   fitting   p .   my   only   complaint   is   how   expensive   it   was ...   26   bucks   for   a   towel   is   a   little   silly   if   you   ask   me .   otherwise ,   we   love   this   item !
never   got   to   my   house ! ! !   this   product   never   got   to   my   house   it   has   been   a   month   and   i   have   contacted   them   twice   it   shows   it   sitting   somewhere   in   wisconsin .   and   they   won   t   do   anything   about   it ! !
not   vanilla   0   stars   i   bought   this   thinking   it   was   one   of   the   vanilla   flavored   teethers .   maybe   because   it   clearly   says   vanilla   in   the   title   of   this   product   it   definitely   was   not .   after   my   first   shipment   was   lost ,   the   seller   quickly   sent   out   another .   although   i   did   end   up   waiting   twice   as   long   br   i   guess   we   can   toss   it   in   the   baby   bag   as   a   just   in   case   toy .   my   daughter   definitely   prefers   the   actual   sophie   instead   of   the   ring   anyway .   br   br   also   i   was   thrilled   to   find   this   particular   sophie   for   half   the   price   as   places   such   as   babies   r   us .   but   the   shipping   cost   the   same   amount   as   the   product .   which   i   thought   seemed   a   little   ridiculous .   but   i   still   continued   with   the   purchase ,   it   was   still   2   less   than   most   other   sellers   chains .
cart   cover   it   is   a   great   product ,   my   son   loves   it .   he   is   able   to   relax   in   the   shopping   cart   while   i   am   buying   all   the   things   that   i   need .
great   i   love   this   walker ,   got   it   for   my   baby   when   she   was   about   6   months ,   she   loved   it   and   figured   out   over   a   month   or   so   how   to   turn   it   around   and   everything .   now   she   is   almost   a   year   and   chases   me   around   the   house   in   it .   the   toy   that   is   in   the   tray   comes   out   and   she   enjoys   it   both   in   and   out   of   the   walker .   it   has   held   up   really   well   and   is   pretty   easy   to   clean .   i   recommend   this   to   anyone   looking   for   an   easy   to   use   walker   with   adjustable   height .
joovy   caboose   stand   on   tandem   stroller   rocks !   we   previously   borrowed   this   stroller   from   a   friend   for   a   trip   to   chicago   with   two   grandkids ...   it   was   fabulous   for   the   airport   and   the   zoo ...   plenty   of   space   for   the   two   of   them   with   a   little   storage   too .
best   in   usa   unfortunately   these   are   the   best   items   sold   in   the   usa   for   keeping   your   younglings   in   a   safe   place .   this   product   is   easily   movable   and   wobbles ,   regardless   of   the   shape   you   put   it   in .   the   only   way   we   were   able   to   get   it   to   stay   still   because   yes   it   is   the   best   sold   here   in   the   usa   was   for   us   to   anchor   it .   even   then   it   still   wobbles   and   moves   just   not   as   bad .
broken   part   disappointed   that   there   were   no   instructions   on   how   to   put   the   child   in   the   trailer .   it   was   confusing   since   i   ve   never   used   one   before .   one   of   the   lower   straps   had   a   broken   ring   and   the   belt   buckle   didn   t   click   well   i   was   concerned   my   daughter   would   get   out   of   the   straps .   she   slipped   down   and   out   of   the   shoulder   straps .   we   will   have   to   use   pillows   to   prop   her   up   and   can   t   currently   use   one   side   since   that   ring   is   broken .
awesome !   we   tried   several   different   door   locks   to   keep   our   2year   old   inside .   this   was   the   only   one   that   she   couldn   t   figure   out !   you   won   t   be   disappointed !
perfect   for   winter   mamas ! !   i   am   breast   feeding   mom   of   over   a   year   now   to   my   daughter .   i   have   two   of   these   pashmama   scarves   and   love   them !   noone   can   tell   that   they   are   a   nursing   cover   when   you   are   wearing   as   a   decorative   scarf .   also ,   it   is   so   easy   to   just   sit   down   anywhere ,   pull   the   cover   over   you   and   baby ,   and   nurse !   it   is   a   little   see   through   but   noone   will   be   able   to   see   anything ,   even   if   they   stare   hard   enough !   this   is   a   great   item   for   hip   mommas   who   want   to   be   in   style   but   feel   comfortable   nursing   in   public !
my   son   loooooves   sassy   rings ! ! !   my   son   loves   sassy   rings   and   at   a   great   price   u   can   t   lose ! !   i   had   gotten   bright   starts   rings   and   they   were   made   cheaply   and   my   son   showed   no   interest
great   product !   i   was   totally   pleased   with   my   purchase ,   it   came   in   a   timely   fashion ,   was   exactly   what   i   ordered   and   i   thought   it   looked   even   better   in   real   life   then   it   had   on   the   computer !
flipping   awesome ! ! !   it   s   so   soft   and   cute ! !   i   m   very   happy   i   went   with   this   frog   bed   set ! !   looks   just   like   the   pic ,   love   it ! ! !   cant   wait   to   set   it   up ! ! !
love   it ! !   just   got   it   and   put   it   together ,   i   love   it ! ! !   it   s   just   like   the   picture   but   way   cuter   in   person ! ! !   it   was   easy   to   put   together ,   can   t   wait   for   my   son   to   use   it ! ! !   i   know   he   ll   love   it   when   he   s   here  
baby   loves   it !   one   of   the   reviews   complained   about   not   being   able   to   protect   the   pictures ,   but   the   pictures   have   been   fine   in   mine   and   i   have   a   5.5   month   old   who   puts   everything   in   her   mouth .   anyway ,   pictures   only   cost   like   10   cents   to   print ,   so   i   don   t   really   care   if   one   gets   damaged   every   once   in   a   while .   it   is   a   great   way   to   help   the   baby   be   able   to   recognize   her   grandparents   since   she   doesn   t   seem   them   as   often   as   we   d   like .
better   than   expected   when   i   saw   the   theme   precious   planet   flannel   blankets   i   just   had   to   order   them .   i   didn   t   expect   them   to   be   very   high   quality   because   of   the   price .   but   to   my   surprise   they   were   very   well   made   and   can   t   wait   to   use   them   in   january   2013   when   the   grand   baby   arrives .
adorable   and   functional   this   wet   bag   is   super   cute ,   and   it   seems   to   be   doing   its   job   well .   i   ve   only   washed   it   a   few   times ,   so   i   can   t   speak   to   its   durability .
great   for   cleaning ............   i   use   diapers   to   clean   my   house .   they   do   not   leave   any   lint   behind   and   they   are   great   for   cleaning   windows ,   mirrors .   no   streaks   are   left   behind .   they   leave   a   great   shine   on   my   furniture ,   glass   table   tops ,   and   my   bathrooms .   i   was   them   first   before   using   them   when   i   first   purchase   them .   i   only   use   degtergent   and   bleach .   no   fabric   softener .   i   rewash   them   after   each   use   the   same   way .   if   you   use   fabric   softener ,   they   will   not   absorb .   i   just   use   luandry   degtergent   and   bleach   and   wash   them   in   hot   water .   they   sure   save   on   other   cleaning   cloths   due   to   you   can   use   these   diapers   over   and   over   again   until   they   are   worn   out .   it   takes   years   for   them   to   wear   out .   it   is   worth   the   price   and   i   am   happy   i   was   able   to   find   more .   where   i   usually   purchase   the   cloth   diapters ,   they   do   not   sell   them   anymore .   they   are   also   great   for   waxing   your   vehicle .   after   you   give   your   vehicle   a   wash ,   just   take   a   clean   diaper   and   wipe   it   down   to   dry   it   off   and   does   not   leave   any   scratches   or   streaks .   best   to   use   in   the   shade .   same   when   waxing   your   vehicle .   your   vehicle   will   shine   and   sparkle   and   make   it   look   brand   new .   no   lint   left   behind   or   streaks .

natursutten   pacifier   great   quality !   great   product !   my   grandson   loves   his   new   pacifier !   i   bought   6   or   7   differnet   pacifiers   and   my   grandson   didn   t   like   any   of   them   until   we   found   this   one .   he   loves   the   large   round   center !   i   now   have   a   happy   baby   boy !
seems   much   lighter   then   other   pacificers   my   kid   didn   t   love   paci   s   but   if   we   could   get   him   to   take   one   this   was   the   only   one   he   would   take .   seems   like   its   lighter   and   easier   for   him   to   hold   in   his   mouth  
genius   invention .   these   things   are   great .   we   have   had   two   previous   ones   one   for   the   diaper   bag   one   for   home   for   a   long   time   now   and   a   round   of   bad   luck   hit   us   when   we   lost   both   of   them   just   within   a   couple   of   weeks   because   my   son   threw   them   out   of   the   stroller   and   i   didn   t   notice   .   we   ordered   another   right   away   because   my   son ,   now   11   months ,   loves   holding   on   to   the   little   animal .   after   losing   our   last   wubbanubs   i   realized   they   were   a   security   blanket   for   our   kiddo .   the   other   huge   plus   is   that   unless   you   have   a   baby   like   mine   who   likes   to   throw   them   out   of   the   stroller   they   are   so   hard   to   lose ,   which   is   good ! !   these   would   also   make   fantastic   gifts .   i   ordered   our   first   one   because   i   thought   it   was   cute .... little   did   i   know   how   amazing   they   actually   are .
very   good   but   threads   came   loose   this   is   a   great   product   and   it   keeps   the   toys   from   falling   on   the   floor   when   attached   to   the   stroller .   however ,   the   ribbon   started   shredding   and   came   apart   after   only   a   few   weeks   of   use .   i   called   the   company   and   they   were   very   annoying   and   would   not   give   me   a   new   one   and   they   told   me   to   contact   amazon .   amazon   sent   me   a   new   package   and   i   sent   the   broken   one   back .   great   service   from   amazon   and   the   product   is   working   just   fine .   must   have   been   a   dud .
didn   t   work   for   my   child   believed   it   or   not   i   wanted   my   kid   to   take   a   pacifier ,   but   he   just   didn   t   like   them .   i   breastfeed   and   he   prefers   to   pacify   on   the   breast .   we   purchased   this   in   an   attempt   to   try   all   different   kinds   to   find   one   he   may   like .   however ,   he   does   love   to   chew   on   this ,   you   can   tell   he   loves   the   feeling   on   his   gums .   and   he   may   like   the   smell   as   it   has   a   very   distinct   one .   at   the   end   of   the   day ,   i   am   not   unhappy   about   this   purchase .   i   think   it   is   worth   a   try   if   you   are   looking   for   a   new   pacifier .
didn   t   use   it   much   my   son   wouldn   t   take   a   pacifier ,   but   we   tried   this   one   and   he   would   take   it   every   once   in   a   while ...
baby   loves   them !   my   coworker   called   these   things   baby   crack   and   said   that   if   your   baby   s   given   these   pacifiers   in   the   hospital ,   she   s   reject   all   others .   my   coworker   was   right !   my   baby   absolutely   loves   these ,   and   rejects   all   other   pacifiers .   br   br   i   gave   this   5   stars   because ,   as   the   mother   of   a   colicky   baby ,   anything   that   calms   her   down   is   a   godsend .   one   thing   i   don   t   love   about   them   is   if   you   drop   them ,   they   both   bounce   and   roll .   doesn   t   sound   like   a   big   deal   until   youre   crawling   around   on   the   floor   at   3   am   with   a   wailing   baby   in   one   arm ,   praying   the   thing   didn   t   roll   behind   the   couch .
love   it   i   never   loose   this   pacifier   cause   it   s   attached   to   an   animal .   the   baby   never   loses   it   cause   it   s   tucked   into   his   shirt   which   also   keeps   it   in   his   mouth .   great   product .   already   recommended   to   everyone !
poor   quality   we   loved   the   concept   of   this .   thought   our   little   one   would   be   able   to   grasp   her   pacifier   much   more   easily   in   the   car   seat .   unfortunatly   the   pacifier   ripped   off   the   caterpiller   the   first   time   we   washed   it .   the   stuffed   animal   is   very   light   weight   and   doesnt   stay   in   place   as   we   expected   thought   it   might   have   the   mass   of   a   beenie   baby   or   have   a   rubber   underside   so   it   doesnt   fall   .   anyway ,   we   bought   sofie   the   giraffe   which   has   turned   out   to   be   a   miracle   on   car   rides   instead .
perfect   to   clean   and   store   this   little   doo   hicky   is   great .   the   tree   hangs   a   lot   of   pacifiers ,   the   top   rotates   and   clicks   into   place   to   lock   it   closed ... keeps   out   dust   or   anything   else   that   might   cling   to   the   nipples ... and   the   bottom   has   a   non   slip   ring   so   it   stays   in   place   on   the   counter   nicely .   this   is   so   much   better   than   the   drawer   or   diaper   bag   for   storage ... i   can   find   the   pacifiers   now   and   no   one   is   touching   them   unless   they   are   getting   one   out .   it   is   a   very   simple   and   effective   tool   for   sterilizing   them   also   and   works   exactly   how   it   was   supposed   to .   br   br   the   bonus   pacifiers   are   nice   too ... they   are   cute   and   of   a   very   nice   quality   and   my   little   guy   likes   them   better   than   his   old   binks ... so   that   s   a   real   bonus .   this   is   a   product   i   definitely   think   is   worth   purchasing   for   a   simple   and   nice   way   to   clean   and   store   pacifiers .
our   baby   loves   her   wubbanub !   our   baby   girl   who   is   almost   3   months ,   is   able   to   hold   her   pacifier   in   her   mouth   because   the   wubbanub   is   big   enough   for   her   to   grip   on   to .   she   has   enough   dexterity   to   hold   the   lamb   with   her   hands ,   and   she   is   so   cute   squeezing   it   as   she   falls   asleep .   we   love   the   wubbanub ,   it   s   her   favorite   pacifier   by   far .   i   totally   recommend   it   for   your   babies .
4   stars   for   misleading   product   title   the   paci   itself   is   absolutely   fine ,   but   i   m   giving   it   a   four   star   review   because   of   the   misleading   title .   they   don   t   carry   this   paci   in   stores   near   me   and   i   thought   i   was   receiving   a   two   pack .   i   received   only   one   and   it   would   have   been   nice   to   know   because   i   could   have   ordered   more   at   the   time .   now   i   ll   have   to   reorder   and   wait .   someone   really   needs   to   stay   on   top   of   the   listings .   it   s   very   frustrating   having   to   read   around   everywhere   for   some   info .   that   s   not   my   job .
must   have   great   baby   shower   gifts ! !   br   if   you   choose   to   use   a   pacifier   this   is   a   must   have   for   infants !   with   our   first   child   we   used   traditional   pacifiers   and   we   were   constantly   having   to   put   it   back   in   our   child   s   mouth   when   it   would   fall   out .   but   not   the   wubba !   this   toy   pacifier   is   ingenious !   it   cuts   down   the   need   to   replace   it   in   the   child   s   mouth   drastically .   if   baby   is   sleeping   with   their   head   tilted   to   the   side   you   can   gently   position   wubba   so   it   is   a   prop   up   to   hold   the   pacifier   in   baby   s   mouth .   when   baby   is   on   their   back   looking   up   at   the   ceiling   you   place   wubba   on   their   chest   and   even   if   their   little   mouth   relaxes   and   falls   open   during   sleep ,   wubba   holds   the   pacifier   gentaly   in   place   so   when   baby   seeks   it   it   is   there !   before   you   know   it   little   one   will   be   holding   on   to   it   great   for   helping   to   develop   dexterity   and   its   too   cute !   we   used   to   joke   about   how   we   wished   there   was   a   type   of   pacifier   headgear ...   well   this   is   the   closest   thing   to   that   without   the   odvious   no   no   s   a   headgear   would   bring  
funny   as   all   get   out ! ! ! !   i   get   laughs   in   church   and   at   the   store   with   this   in   my   kids   mouth .   it   is   actually   his   favorite   binky !
my   son   loves   these .   these   are   the   only   pacifiers   my   son   has   ever   truly   liked ,   and   i   have   tried   a   number   of   different   types ,   shapes ,   and   brands   with   him .   they   are   awesome ,   and   i   know   my   son   also   thinks   so   because   these   are   the   only   pacifiers   he   wont   spit   out .
my   baby   loves   these !   my   baby   will   take   no   other   pacifier !   the   hospital   gave   us   this   one ,   and   she   loves   it !   i   have   tried   the   gumdrop   pacifiers   because   they   are   supposedly   the   same   nipple   as   these ,   but   she   spits   those   out .   she   instantly   calms   down   with   theis   pacifier .
plush   permanently   attached   to   pacifier   i   purchased   this   product   for   my   son   so   he   could   better   hold   his   pacifier .   he   is   6   months   and   it   seems   at   the   top   range   for   the   wubbanub .   i   was   disappointed   that   the   giraffe   was   permanently   attached   to   the   pacifier   i   suppose   i   did   not   understand   completely   understand ,   but   i   thought   it   was   attached   by   a   gripper   of   some   kind   that   would   allow   a   pacifier   to   be   changed   when   it   became   worn .   the   cheaning   instructions   seem   to   state   that   they   can   be   washed   seperately ,   but   not   sure   how   it   is   suppose   to   work .   would   not   have   purchased   if   had   realized   that   fact .
love   it   there   really   is   no   difference   between   these   and   any   other   pacifiers   just   the   look .   but   beings   that   my   wife   is   a   packers   fan   it   sure   is   fun   having   the   cowboys   pacifiers   around .
important   for   all   doorstep   children !   as   is   common   in   these   free   thinking ,   immoral   days   an   unwed   single   mother   left   her   unwanted   child   on   my   doorstep .   at   first   i   tried   to   phone   social   services   they   called   me   a   racist   homophobe   and   hung   up .   the   police   were   similarly   unhelpful .   what   was   i   to   do   my   wife   suggested   drowning   him ,   but   the   council   forces   us   to   sort   our   rubbish   at   gunpoint ,   and   which   recycling   bag   do   babies   go   in   it   was   clearly   not   the   answer .   br   br   several   times   i   tried   leaving   him   at   the   local   park ,   but   no   one   would   take   him   not   even   the   strange   homeless   man   with   the   jesus   is   love   sandwich   board .   it   looked   like   we   were   doomed   to   a   life   or   depressing   parental   drudgery .   br   br   then   we   discovered   the   3ct   diamond   pacifier .   at   first   we   were   skeptical   diamonds   are   mined   in   the   third   world ,   where   poor   people   live !   but   we   did   notice   it   is   pleasingly   shiny   and   pacifier   shaped .   anyway ,   for   less   than   the   price   of   buying   up   the   whole   planet   s   nuclear   weapons ,   we   were   rid   of   our   problem !   we   simply   popped   it   in   his   mouth   and   left   him   in   what   the   proletariat   call   a   shopping   mall .   he   was   gone   in   seconds !   br   br   thank   you !   if   only   all   of   life   s   problems   could   be   solved   by   buying   a   17 , 000   diamond   pacifier .   unfortunately   only   most   of   them   can .
natural   rubber   is   the   way   to   go !   we   love   these   pacifiers .   they   are   so   much   softer   then   the   regular   silicone   pacifiers .   even   if   you   don   t   get   these   for   health   reasons   get   them   because   they   are   much   softer   and   gummier   for   the   baby .   we   have   used   them   since   our   boy   was   born .   even   though   he   is   breastfed ,   we   did   not   have   any   issues   with   nipple   confusion .   he   took   the   pacifier   when   he   was   not   hungry .   when   he   was   hungry   he   didn   t   want   it .   they   do   have   to   be   replaced   once   they   become   sticky .   but   for   sanitary   reasons   it   s   best   to   replace   any   kind   of   pacifer   after   about   2   3   months .
softer   than   other   gumdrop   pacis   there   are   a   few   companies   who   make   the   gumdrop   pacifier   and   this   one   is   the   best .   it   is   the   most   flexible ,   soft   and   lightweight .   if   your   child   cant   keep   the   soothie   in ,   get   these !   i   used   these   until   my   daughter   got   the   hang   of   her   soothie .
so   cute   and   easy   to   find .   if   i   had   seen   this   in   a   store   i   would   have   never   bought   it   because   at   first   i   thought   it   was   impratical .   but   after   seeing   such   good   reviews   and   seeing   that   the   price   wasnt   steep   i   caved ,   and   i   m   so   happy   i   did .   trust   me   when   i   say   if   your   child   likes   the   soothies   they   will   adore   this .   my   daughter   doesnt   even   use   the   pacifier   half   the   time   and   she   loves   the   monkey .   she   has   three   of   these   we   had   four   but   the   dog   ate   one   and   we   keep   one   in   the   main   areas   of   the   house   and   one   in   the   carseat .   it   is   her   little   travel   buddy ,   so   cute
love   these !   i   love   these   little   guys !   so   cute ,   so   easy   to   find ,   and   pretty   cheap .   just   make   sure   your   kid   loves   the   soothie   and   your   dog   doesnt   find   it   before   you .
ha   larious !   bought   this   for   my   friends   baby   and   had   some   good   laughs !   and   it   shut   him   up   for   a   while   too !
does   what   it   says .   does   what   is   needed   to   do   and   is   good   quality   however ,   once   again ,   you   cannot   choose   the   color .   doesnt   bother   me   but   might   bother   mothers   of   boys   who   could   receive   any   color .   also   the   color   i   received   a   baby   blue ,   isnt   even   shown   here   .
as   always   amazon   is   on   point .   my   daughter   loves   these   pacis   and   now   that   shes   teething   she   loves   to   chew   them   with   my   finger   underneath .   cute   colors   and   delivered   on   time .   would   reccomend   to   anyone   who   has   a   child   that   is   teething   that   was   is   breastfed   as   they   are   more   like   mom   then   other   brands .
nice   i   loves   these   but   my   daughter   hated   them   she   preferred   her   favorite   paci ... they   r   nice   and   very   flexible   don   t   have   any   hard   plastic   , so   if   u   have   a   wild   sleeper   they   won   t   b   hurt   but   these   if   they   roll   over   it   or   hit   it   wit   their   face   if   it   falls   out ! !  
secure   tethers   these   tethers   are   long   enough   to   allow   baby   to   play   the   attached   toy   but   not   too   long   to   be   dangerous .   snaps   securely   on   both   ends .   i   m   quite   happy   and   would   order   again .
very   nice   for   the   price !   these   are   the   same   as   other   nuk   pacifiers   except   they   have   hello   kitty   on   them !   my   granddaughter   loves   them .   i   have   sterilized   them   hand   washed   them   several   times   already   and   the   image   is   still   perfect .   i   was   afraid   it   would   rub   off ,   but   no   worries .
pacifiers   for   a   new   granddaughter   these   are   the   cutest   things ,   and   trust   me   after   3   brothers   she   is   definitely   the   princess .   the   pacifier   just   helps   everyone   else   to   know   she   is   the   princess .
my   baby   loves   this   i   have   tried   dr . brown   s   pacifier   and   he   hates   it .   now   after   my   doctor   s   recommendation   i   got   this   and   my   baby   loves   it .
great   pacifier   this   is   a   great   pacifier .   i   purchased   this   right   before   the   birth   of   my   little   girl   and   she   has   been   using   it   since   the   first   day   she   was   born .   its   easy   to   find   if   its   dropped .   she   loves   the   softness   and   print   of   the   giraffe .   its   super   easy   to   wash   as   it   is   machine   washable .   i   recommend   this   to   everyone .   i   ve   purchased   another   one   for   a   friend   since   we   love   it   so   much .   you   won   t   regret   it .
love   nuk   but   not   in   blue   and   green   my   daughter   loves   the   nuk   pacifiers   but   i   was   very   unhappy   recieving   two   packages   of   blue   and   green   pacifiers   when   i   thought   i   was   getting   pink   and   yellow !
perfect   for   my   little   snowflake   my   daughter   is   the   most   precious   little   unique   snowflake ,   and   she   deserves   only   the   best   items   no   matter   what   the   cost .   would   i   ever   put   a   non   diamond   encrusted   binky   in   my   snookie   wookums   mouth   no   i   wouldn   t !   my   little   princess   will   be   the   most   fashionable   baby   in   the   trailer   park   that   i   had   to   move   into   after   buying   this .
mommy   s   helper   safer   grip   i   bought   this ,   already   have   two   others   of   two   different   brands .   i   am   really   impressed   with   out   strongly   this   one   grips .   i   will   buy   more   of   these .
i   like   it   less   every   time   i   try   to   use   it   this   always   seemed   like   such   a   hassle   to   get   on   the   moby   wrap   was   way   easier   would   have   thought   this   would   be   simpler   to   throw   on   and   buckle   but   adjusting   all   the   belts   and   getting   him   in   is   a   pain .   tried   to   use   it   more   once   he   got   too   heavy   for   the   moby   and   realize   how   much   of   a   hassle   it   is .   we   tried   to   spend   10   minutes   me   and   my   sister   getting   it   on   my   husband   so   he   could   walk   to   teh   store   with   the   baby .   we   gave   up   after   trying   to   adjust   the   straps   to   fit   him ,   get   baby   in   comfortably ,   rethread   the   belt   mentioned   on   some   other   reviews   ... we   finally   gave   up   and   he   took   the   stroller .
affordable   and   easy   to   install   initially ,   i   purchased   one   set   to   try   and   since   they   worked   well   i   bought   8   more   sets .   i   was   very   impressed   with   these   cabinet   locks .   we   do   not   have   exterior   handles   on   our   cabinetry   and   wanted   a   concealed   lock .   i   followed   the   instructions ,   used   the   templates   and   had   no   issues   installing   the   locks .   my   baby   is   just   beginning   to   crawl   and   has   not   attempted   any   cabinet   opening   yet ,   but   i   have   tested   the   doors   and   think   they   will   hold   up   well .   i   also   like   the   ability   to   swivel   the   lock .   even   though   i   don   t   plan   on   disarming   the   locks   it   helped   in   the   installation .   i   was   able   to   swivel   the   hook   when   attaching   it   to   the   drawer   door   and   it   made   it   much   easier   to   get   into   tight   corners .
they   are   okay .   i   started   to   like   the   idea   of   cotton   nursing   pads   and   was   looking   forward   to   using   these .   realized   that   the   diameter   was   too   small   to   cover   your   breast   while   still   looking   like   a   natural   shape .   i   use   the   lansinoh   which   are   the   best   out   there   because   it   s   got   a   dry   layer ,   great   coverage ,   and   contoured   to   fit   breast   naturally   so   you   can   t   see   outline .   all   lacking   with   these   cotton   ones .   they   are   thicker   than   disposables   and   flat .
good   buy   we   bought   this   for   my   daughter   to   match   her   crib .   quality   was   fair   for   the   price .   it   was   a   pain   to   put   it   together   we   tried   to   get   the   parts   as   organized   as   possible   when   we   were   doing   the   assembly   but   it   was   still   a   challenge .   color   was   darker   than   what   was   pictured .   i   think   the   material   and   make   of   the   product   itself   is   average   and   parallel   to   the   price .
great   toy ...   we   introduced   this   product   to   my   daughter   first   as   a   toy ,   then   after   a   couple   weeks   a   harness .   it   works   great ,   with   the   exception   that   the   tail   attaches   so   low   it   throws   her   off   balance   if   she   comes   to   the   end   of   the   slack .   my   daughter   is   very   independent   and   this   allows   her   enough   freedom   to   strut   her   stuff .
dislike   i   hate   this   diaper   pail .   you   have   to   push   down   and   pull   up   to   drop   the   diaper   in   which   is   not   an   easy   task   when   you   have   a   dirty   diaper   in   your   hand .   gross !   i   wish   i   registered   for   the   one   that   had   a   foot   peddle .   oh   and   it   s   a   never   ending   expense   with   having   to   buy   the   refill   bags   but   thats   with   all   the   diaper   pails .
still   a   favorite   at   age   6   my   daughter   got   her   bunny   at   one   year   and   still   loves   it   now   nearly   6years   later .   this   is   hands   down   the   best   quality   stuffed   animal   for   a   young   child .   it   weathers   many   washings   while   retaining   its   softness .   i   have   looked   for   a   cat   of   this   quality   for   my   younger   daughter   who   adores   kitties   and   have   had   to   buy   several   cats   because   they   just   don   t   last   the   way   this   bunny   does .   even   though   my   daughter   doesn   t   sleep   with   her   bunny   every   night   anymore ,   she   still   goes   on   all   trips   and   gets   dressed   in   lots   of   different   outfits   other   doll   clothes   fit !   and   we   have   fun   sewing   our   own   dresses   for   the   bunny !   this   is   a   purchase   you   won   t   regret .
good   product   i   originally   purchased   the   colgate   eco   classica   i   crib   mattress ,   beige   because   this   product   was   supposed   to   take   4   6   weeks   to   ship .   however ,   i   returned   that   item   and   purchased   this   one   instead   when   a   few   days   later   it   was   in   stock   and   ready   to   ship   within   a   couple   of   days .   i   m   glad   i   exchanged   the   items ,   because   i   prefer   that   this   mattress   is   dual   sided   in   terms   of   firmness .   the   fabric   on   this   one   is   not   quite   as   fancy   as   the   other   one   which   was   a   smooth   cotton   damask   ,   but   for   the   price   this   one   is   only   10   more   ,   i   hope   to   get   more   years   of   use .   the   firmer   side   seems   a   bit   less   firm   than   the   eco   classica   i .   the   product   is   light ,   so   easy   to   maneuver ,   and   was   well   packed .   there   was   no   smell   after   unpacking   the   mattress ,   and   it   fit   my   baby   europa   palisades   crib   perfectly .   i   haven   t   tried   fitting   sheets   on   it   yet ,   and   the   baby   hasn   t   arrived   yet ,   so   i   can   t   comment   on   actually   using   it   just   yet .   br   br   9   25   12   update   after   over   one   month   of   use ,   still   happy   with   mattress .   however ,   we   did   flip   it   over   to   use   the   slightly   softer   toddler   side   for   our   one   month   old .   the   softer   side   plus   a   more   padded   organic   cotton   mattress   pad   seemed   more   comfortable   while   still   being   safe ,   though   obviously   she   cannot   tell   us   if   it   is   or   isn   t .

my   kids   beg   me   to   turn   this   on .   we   got   this   as   a   christmas   gift   for   my   18   month   old ,   and   i   stored   it .   i   finally   pulled   it   out   when   my   goddaughters   came   to   spend   a   week   with   us ,   and   i   needed   something   to   entertain   4   children   while   i   washed   the   entire   crew   down .   it   was   a   huge   hit .   reviews   that   there   are   few   bubbles   may   have   to   do   with   poor   or   old   bubble   solution .   it   does   use   a   lot   but   it   makes   lots   of   bubbles ,   and   when   i   went   to   get   more   bubbles   out   of   my   closet ,   the   old   bubble   solutions   and   the   cheap   ones ,   did   not   work   nearly   as   well   as   the   newer ,   better   quality   ones .   the   difference   is   dramatic ...   gobs   of   bubbles   with   one ,   hardly   any   with   the   other .   of   course ,   i   have   dropped   it   into   the   water   already ,   and   it   is   still   working .   you   do   not   want   to   leave   the   bubble   solution   in   after   you   finish   using   the   toy .   i   did   and   when   i   started   it   up   again   after   5   days   of   non   use ,   part   of   the   solution   had   evaporated ,   leaving   a   thicker   fluid   and   the   motor   had   a   hard   time   moving   the   wheel   around   it   also   produced   minimal   bubbles .   so ,   empty   it   if   you   are   not   using   it   at   every   bath   time .   if   it   broke   today ,   i   would   buy   it   again .   at   only   12   13 ,   what   do   you   really   expect  
way   better   than   sassy   on   the   go   formula   dispenser !   i   loved   this   formula   dispenser !   you   can   t   really   tell   from   the   picture   that   the   side   with   the   lid   is   funnel   shaped ,   which   makes   it   easier   for   the   formula   to   flow   out   into   the   bottle .   i   nursed   my   daughter   at   first ,   so   i   only   needed   it   for   6   months ,   but   it   held   up   well .   br   br   why   it   s   way   better   than   sassy   on   the   go   formula   dispenser   at   first   i   bought   the   sassy   on   the   go   formula   dispenser   and   hated   it .   there   is   no   funnel   under   the   lid ,   it   s   just   flat ,   so   some   of   the   formula   would   go   into   the   bottle ,   and   the   rest   of   it   was   stick   inside   the   container .   why   bother   premeasuring   the   exact   amount   you   need   if   you   can   only   get   part   of   out   of   the   container   go   with   the   munchkin   dispenser .
not   impressed   i   was   informed   last   minute   that   my   aunt   was   throwing   a   baby   shower   for   my   mother ,   and   i   couldn   t   make   it .   as   a   result ,   i   was   shopping   around   for   a   gift   that   i   could   have   shipped   to   the   house .   i   thought   these   looked   cute   and   wasn   t   too   disappointed   when   i   saw   then ,   although   the   quality   isn   t   great .   the   monkey   images   are   just   stickers   and   the   one   on   the   pacifier   has   faded   pretty   fast   not   a   huge   deal ,   but   still   .   .   .   .   my   biggest   complaint   is   that   the   product   doesn   t   describe   the   nipple   size .   i   assumed   that   the   4oz   ones   would   work   for   a   baby   under   three   months ,   but   the   flow   was   too   high .   now   that   she   is   3   mos   old   and   eating   somewhere   closer   to   6oz ,   she   can   finally   use   them .   basically ,   i   don   t   think   we   re   going   to   get   a   whole   lot   of   use   out   of   the   smaller   bottles   and ,   had   the   product   description   warned   me   of   that ,   i   probably   would   have   elected   to   buy   something   else .
a   good   buy   it   helps   my   baby   alot   and   he   likes   it   so   this   is   a   good   product   to   by   and   it   will   last   a   long   time   for   u   and   your   baby
durable   wonderful   amazon   doess   a   terrible   job   with   the   pictures   and   description   on   this .   br   we   bought   an   older   version   of   this   car   seat   to   stroller   airport   accessory   over   5   years   ago   with   our   first   for   flights   after   struggling   through   airports   on   our   first   trip   as   parents .   it   has   been   a   lifesaver   from   day   1 !   we   ve   now   taken   it   through   about   20   airports   about   50   times ,   with   kids   from   8   to   40   pounds ,   all   with   a   britax   roundabout   car   seat .   still   drives   easily .   still   opens   and   closes   easily .   it   has   been   years   since   we   found   a   security   gate   that   it   didnt   fit   through ,   and   if   we   d   had   the   quick   release   wheels   then   it   would   have   been   a   non   issue .   we   even   have   belted   it   in   on   the   plane   attached   to   the   car   seat   as   is .   we   see   many   more   cumbersome   baby   transport   options   at   the   airport ,   but   never   one   easier .   even   my   spendthrift   husband   reported   that   it   paid   for   itself   the   first   time   we   used   it .

comfy ,   cute ,   practical   the   best   bibs !   love   these   bibs   because   they   clean   easy ,   wipe   right   off   for   several   uses   and   then   throw   in   the   washer   later .   best   of   all ,   they   re   soft   fit   snuggly   around   baby   s   neck   to   actually   serve   the   purpose   of   a   bib
worked   fine   for   me !   i   got   these   for   my   son   s   room .   we   have   no   texture   on   the   walls   but   they   are   painted   with   satin   finish   paint .   they   stick   fine ,   and   as   we   have   moved   furniture   around ,   i   was   able   to   reposition   them   on   the   walls .   i   am   now   using   them   in   my   other   son   s   bedroom   as   well .   one   room   is   painted   a   light   lime   mint   green ,   and   the   other   is   a   light   blue   but   darker   than   baby   blue   ,   and   they   look   good   in   both   rooms .   i   like   that   as   they   get   older ,   we   can   just   peel   them   off   the   walls   and   don   t   have   to   repaint .
quite   satisfied   with   this   mirror   we   took   a   long   road   trip   with   the   baby   just   a   couple   months   after   his   birth .   this   mirror   was   great ,   totally   necessary   i   would   say   definitely   get   one   if   you   plan   on   being   in   the   car   for   more   than   5   or   10   minutes   at   a   time .   it   is   large   enough   to   have   a   good   view   of   your   kid ,   to   see   if   their   pacifier   has   fallen   out   or   their   head   is   at   some   ridiculous   angle   to   their   body ,   etc .   it   was   a   bit   annoying   to   install ,   but   after   that   it   s   very   easy   to   adjust ,   and   it   wraps   around   the   headrest   in   such   a   way   that   it   won   t   fall   down .   plus   it   s   just   not   that   heavy   so   it   wouldn   t   be   a   big   deal   if   it   did   happen   to   fall   down .   which   it   won   t .   br   it   s   easiest   to   install   if   you   have   a   headrest ,   but   if   you   don   t ,   i   remember   there   being   lots   of   options   for   installation   i   m   sure   you   could   attach   it   somehow .
disappointing   the   item   dimensions   arent   as   specified .   when   they   are   on   the   stairwell   they   can   t   be   made   tight   enough   even   with   tools   to   uphold   consistent   t   usage   so   they   slip   and   the   gate   doesnt   hold   in   place .   beware   even   though   they   are   to   protect   the   wood   from   unnecessary   drilling   they   need   to   be   drilled   into   place   to   stay   put .   more   of   a   hassle   the .   a   help   in   the   end .   we   are   returning   these   as   they   are   not   what   the   company   claims   and   don   t   work   as   the   company   claims   they   will .   also   be   prepared   to   buy   your   own   screws   as   they   send   one   size   and   if   you   need   smaller   they   tell   you   to   buy   them   yourself .

impossible   to   use ,   inaccurate   the   thermometer   is   totally   counter   intuitive .   if   you   ve   lost   the   directions ,   you   ll   never   figure   out   how   to   get   it   working .   even   if   you   do ,   the   readings   are   totally   inaccurate   and   range   by   several   degrees   over   a   few   minutes .   i   m   going   to   the   drugstore   to   get   a   normal ,   under   the   tongue ,   old   fashioned   thermometer   right   now .
eh   okay   the   idea   is   good   but   it   s   not   living   up   to   it   s   promises .   it   takes   a   while   to   heat   up   and   you   must   heat   it   up   in   hot   water .   you   can   t   microwave   it   so   it   s   not   a   convenient   solution   and   it   can   only   cover   one   area   of   the   breast .   br   br   these   were   okay   for   cold   use   however   and   did   provide   some   relief   to   my   aching   breasts .
fabric   gate   perfect   for   what   we   needed .   we   are   using   it   as   a   way   to   block   off   the   litter   box   from   our   dog .
quick   fix   for   a   stubborn   baby   i   bought   this   item   for   my   wife .   she   had   been   trying   to   get   our   7   month   old   to   start   eating   with   a   spoon .   needless   to   say   baby   girl   is   head   strong   and   ill   give   her   that   being   a   premature   baby .   she   was   4   months   early .   so   these   were   a   godsend .   first   they   came   1   day   early   with   2   day   shipping   and   it   was   packaged   well ,   bubble   wrap   thingy   and   had   the   shipping   label   in   box .   i   ordered   green   but   its   more   turquoise .   which   is   cool .   it   was   easy   to   clean   hand   wash   and   put   back   together   but   the   tops   caps   dont   work   so   travel   will   not   be   an   option .   that   s   why   i   gave   it   4   stars .   other   than   that   i   think   they   are   great .   these   negative   reviews   are   weird .   you   really   have   to   be   simple   if   you   cant   work   put   together   a   bottle .   the   instructions   are   on   the   back   of   the   package .   just   saying .   i   would   recommend   this   to   anyone   who   just   need   one   thing   to   go   smoothly   in   their   day .
fights   the   florida   sun !   my   wife   and   i   have   an   ez   cling   sun   shade   in   each   of   our   cars .   it   works   wonderfully   for   such   a   simple   little   device .   br   br   it   clings   instantly   to   the   car   window   and   is   very   easy   to   move   and   center .
works   great ,   love   using   i   love   this   pump .   it   works   great   and   i   love   the   design   of   the   shield   and   how   it   kinda   massages   the   breast .   its   very   easy   and   quick   to   clean .
still   carries   these   around   with   her   at   12   months   we   ordered   these   at   5   months ,   and   really   regretted   not   getting   them   earlier .   she   loved   playing   with   the   legs   of   the   ladybug   and   the   antennae   of   the   bee .   our   daughter   is   12   months   old   and   still   loves   these .   she   carries   them   around   with   her   all   over   the   place .   i   like   that   they   re   small ,   but   too   big   to   choke   on .   i   highly   recommend   them .
interesting   article   i   do   not   currently   own   the   product ,   but   after   researching   the   negative   feedback   category   i   will   probably   purchase   it .   a   helpful   article   was   this   one   that   is   available   on   pubmed .   ...   .   being   a   doctor   myself   it   was   easy   for   me   to   follow ,   however ,   it   may   not   be   suitable   for   some   without   a   background   of   health   or   medicine .   from   my   point   of   view   it   appears   that   owners   are   more   vigilant   in   monitoring   for   torticollis   and   that   cases   are   caught   earlier   rather   than   being   caused   by   the   sleeper ,   itself .   in   regards   to   flattening   of   the   skull   aka   deformational   plagiocephaly   ,   it   is   a   relatively   common   condition   in   societies   that   put   their   babies   to   sleep   on   their   backs .   i ,   myself ,   have   a   flat   back   on   my   skull ,   and   no   one   even   knows   it   is   there   as   it   is   covered   by   hair .   i   can   imagine ,   however ,   that   in   severe   cases   that   a   medical   skull   reforming   helmet   would   be   necessary   for   aesthetic   purposes .   just   my   two   cents .   hopefully ,   some   of   those   researching   the   item   can   find   this   article   helpful .   the   five   stars   are   only   what   i   expect   it   to   be .   will   update   as   i   get   experience   with   it .
great   monitor   easy   to   replace   batteries .   i   have   my   own   stories   about   this   monitor   waking   us   up   when   our   baby   was   not   breathing ,   but   i   have   to   add   that   this   monitor   uses   four   regular   aaa   nimh   nickel   metal   hydride   batteries .   it   s   been   three   years   now ,   and   it   s   time   to   get   a   new   set   of   batteries .   we   don   t   have   to   buy   some   special ,   proprietary   battery   available   only   from   the   manufacturer .   i   continue   to   be   very   happy   with   this   purchase !
great !   i   love   it ! !   it   was   so   easy   to   put   together   i   didnt   even   need   the   manual ! !   i   wouldnt   want   any   other   pack   n   play   other   than   my   graco   pack   n   playard   with   newborn   napper !   i   love   the   color   too ,   it   s   great   for   a   boy   or   girl   they   also   shipped   it   to   me   within   2   days .   i   couldnt   be   more   happy   with   this   product   and   how   well   they   did   with   shipping   it   to   me .
just   right   i   bought   these   for   my   grandkids   because   their   little   hands   just   can   t   hold   the   larger   cups   without   all   the   spills .   these   are   perfect   for   toddlers .
some   of   the   best   receiving   blankets   on   the   market   my   husband   and   i   recently   purchased   two   sets   of   these   blankets   to   supplement   the   various   store   brands   that   we   own .   these   receiving   blankets   are   superior   to   all   the   other   brands   we   own .   br   br   they   are   larger   than   brands   bought   from   kohls   and   wal   mart .   they   are   a   solid   30   x   40   inches   which   is   more   than   adequate   for   wrapping   up   a   small   infant .   none   of   the   other   brands   came   close   to   this   size   and   they   drew   up   substantially   in   the   wash   on   the   first   washing .   not   so   with   these   carter   blankets .   they   can   handle   multiple   washings   with   little   shrinkage .   br   br   i   don   t   know   about   you   but   receiving   blankets   take   some   abuse   here .   when   you   have   a   newborn ,   i   ve   found   that   anything   will   do   in   a   pinch ... so   receiving   blankets   get   put   through   the   ringer   as   towels   and   burp   cloths ,   etc .   these   blankets   seem   well   equipped   for   the   job .   overall ,   they   are   of   great   quality .   br   br   they   are   pretty   shades   of   100   cotton   flannel   in   mixed   prints   of   brown   and   pink .   they   are   soft   on   baby   s   skin .   br   br   i   am   happy   to   have   bought   these   in   two   sets .   they   are   a   little   hard   to   find   online   sometimes   and   i   wish   i   had   bought   a   couple   more   sets .
color   clarity   this   is   a   total   ripoff .   it   looks   nice ,   but   remember   the   4   c   s   that   s   right ,   they   tell   you   how   many   carats ,   but   what   about   cut ,   clarity ,   and   color   for   my   child ,   nothing   less   than   a   vs1   or   an   f   will   do .   hold   out   for   a   better   diamond .
happy   buyer   product   came   on   time   and   in   good   condition .   this   is   an   advance   purchase ,   my   baby   wont   use   it   in   the   next   3   months   but   the   value   for   the   price   and   the   condition   of   the   item   is   excellent .   i   am   pretty   happy   to   have   bought   this   in   advance !
love   this   paci   tether !   we   love   this   paci   tether !   as   with   all   toys ,   parents   should   watch   for   degradation   of   materials .   we   use   this   as   a   tether ,   not   a   teething   toy .   when   i   see   a   crack ,   i   remove   the   bead ,   removing   just   1   or   two   beads   does   not   render   this   tether   useless .   i   ve   only   lost   1   bead   on   each   of   the   tethers   i   own   2   .
mia   our   particular   daughter   mia   loves   the   pink   binkys   so   she   was   very   happy   to   receive   these   in   the   mail   quickly
satisfied   the   product   was   purchased   as   a   gift   and   the   new   mom   loved   it .   she   thought   it   was   very   clever .   it   was   delivered   in   a   timely   fashion   and   there   weren   t   any   problems   to   report .
loves   her   wubnub   my   daughter   was   having   a   hard   time   keeping   her   paci   in ,   and   every   time   we   put   her   to   bed   it   would   pop   out   and   she   would   start   fussing   until   we   came   and   put   it   back   in .   i   wanted   something   to   prop   it   in   there   with   but   didn   t   want   to   have   a   suffication   hazard   so   i   found   the   wubbanub !   it   worked   like   magic !   we   set   it   on   her   chest   or   on   the   bed   next   to   her   and   it   keeps   her   paci   in   until   she   doesn   t   want   it .   also   she   loves   to   hold   on   to   the   soft   giraffe   it   s   like   a   double   soothe .   it   was   smaller   than   i   thought   which   i   was   happy   about .   i   didn   t   want   anything   to   overwhelming   for   her .   it   s   about   the   size   of   a   beanie   baby   everytime   we   go   places   people   are   always   commenting   on   how   cute   it   is ..   and   how   cute   she   is   with   it !
it   does   i   see   not   a   very   good   opinion   about   this   product .   it   got   broken   after   1.5   month   but   still   it   was   my   daughter   s   favourite   one .   and   i   getting   another   one .   i   feel   i   cannot   expect   the   plastic   not   to   brake   when   her   binky   is   20   times   a   day   drop   on   the   floor .   that   s   how   my   daughter   treated   it .   in   fact   it   looks   to   bulky   on   her   face   but   it   is   only   us ,   the   baby   doesn   t   care .   and   of   course   she   played   with   it   folding   and   opening   the   wings   nonstop .   it   realy   saved   me   from   cleaning   her   pacifier   too   often   a   day .
only   pacifier   my   daughter   will   take   this   is   the   only   pacifier   my   daughter   will   take   so   i   have   to   give   it   a   good   review !   we   tried   nuk   and   she   constantly   spit   them   out .   the   soothies   look   big   but   are   perfect   from   newborn   to   3   months .   everyone   gets   a   kick   out   of   looking   inside   the   hole   to   see   her   sucking   on   it .   the   only   issues   i   have   with   these   pacifiers   are   that   pacifier   clips   don   t   go   on   them   easily   and   the   thing   bounces   like   a   rubber   ball   when   it   hits   the   floor !
sanity   saver   these   are   the   only   pacifiers   my   daughter   will   take   and   she   loves   them .   the   wal   mart   in   our   area   stopped   carrying   them   and   i   couldn   t   find   them   anywhere .   we   were   getting   desperate   as   our   daughter   will   not   sleep   if   she   doesn   t   have   one .   i   ordered   2   packs   so   i   would   have   extra   and   wouldn   t   have   to   worry   about   running   out   again .   i   love   the   product   and   the   price   was   great ,   but   they   get   you   on   the   shipping .   i   paid   almost   10   for   standard   shipping   for   two   packs   in   a   small   enveloped   package .   i   thought   that   was   ridiculous .   otherwise ,   very   pleased .
too   hard   pacifier   itself   is   too   hard .   the   stuffed   animal   though   is   cute .   my   newborn   never   liked   it .   maybe   her   mouth   was   too   small   idk .... but   its   great   teether   tho ..   soothed   her   gums   while   she   was   cutting   teeth
adorable   and   practical !   i   am   so   pleased   with   this   adorable   erosion   of   the   elephant   wubbanub .   this   product   is   not   only   cute ,   it   s   a   lifesaver   for   babies   who   constantly   spit   out   their   pacifier .   highly   recommended .
pleased   we   chose   these   because   they   use   them   in   the   nicus .   if   they   are   a   safe   choice   for   the   premies   then   we   are   sold .   no   issues   with   them .
disappointed   by   the   product   when   i   tried   this   on   my   4   month   old   son ,   he   spit   it   out   right   away ,   showing   absolutely   no   interest   in   this   type   of   pacifier .   br   so   i   thought   the   design   must   have   something   to   do   with   it .   though   i   understand   different   babies   prefer   different   types   of   pacifiers ,   this   is   still   a   disappointing   experience .
worth   it   i   think   this   gift   will   be   worth   the   money .   my   baby   is   not   here   yet   but   i   have   heard   great   things   from   friends   regarding   wub   a   nubs .   the   giraffe   is   pretty   thin   but   we   will   see   how   it   holds   up .
great   paci   for   breastfed   baby   i   tried   countless   other   pacifiers   with   no   luck   before   finding   these .   my   son   loves   these   and   they   really   help   him   at   nap   time .   glad   to   find   them   because   the   stores   are   no   longer   carrying   them .
no   way   this   thing   actually   works   honestly ,   the   manufacturer   says   that   this   sterilizes   pacifiers ,   but   i   have   a   very   hard   time   believing   them .   now ,   i   ve   not   done   any   scientific   tests ,   but   this   thing   is   very   cheap   looking   feeling   plastic ,   takes   a   few   aaa   batteries   and   when   you   press   it   down   sometimes   a   very   ordinary   light   comes   on   and   then   switches   off   after   awhile .   again ,   it   may   work ,   but   if   i   had   to   bet   whether   it   did   or   didn   t ,   i   would   whole   heartedly   bet   on   that   it   didn   t .   the   manufacturers   might   do   well   to   either   make   the   light   brighter   or   make   the   thing   hum   or   vibrate   so   it   looks   like   it   is   doing   something ,   but   no   a   normal   light   comes   on   and   then   it   goes   off   and   miraculously   the   pacifier   that   just   fell   on   the   floor   is   supposed   to   be   sterile   i   don   t   know .   br   br   i   do   know   that   if   it   has   snot   on   it   or   small   pieces   of   dust   or   dirt ,   they   don   t   fall   off .   they   don   t   look   different   after   going   into   this   gadget ,   so   i   would   save   myself   the   money   and   buy   some   wipes   that   will   at   least   get   the   junk   off   of   a   pacifier   that   falls   on   the   ground   or   your   kid   has   been   sucking   on   forever ,   because   at   least   it   cleans   it   off .   it   is   up   to   you   to   decide   whether   to   believe   this   cheap   feeling   imported   machine   actually   sterilizes ,   but   if   you   re   a   skeptic   like   me ,   save   your   money .
very   nice   my   son   will   only   use   the   gumdrop   pacifiers .   it   was   the   brand   given   to   him   at   the   hospital .   they   have   a   holder   that   we   can   use   to   attach   his   pacifier   holder .
my   daughter   is   having   fun   with   it !   my   7   month   old   daughter   loves   this   pacifier .   she   also   uses   it   as   a   teether .   she   chews   it   from   both   sides .   it   s   safe   and   very   soft ,   she   can   t   hit   herself   with   it ,   or   get   hurt   when   she   rolls   over   it   while   asleep .
safe   and   natural   !   love   these   wipes   for   their   quality   and   mildness   !   my   baby   often   drops   her   pacifier   and   other   teething   toys   and   these   come   to   my   rescue   all   the   time   !   my   baby   s   occupational   therapist   was   astonished   to   hear   about   wipes   for   pacifiers   available   these   days  
awesome ! !   this   is   the   only   pacificer   my   8   month   daughter   will   take ..   it   is   all   one   piece   and   easy   to   clean ..   it   is   true   to   the   picture   unlike   someone   said   and   it   says   colors   vary   so   you   cant   be   picky   on   what   colors   you   get .   luckily   i   got   pink   so   i   was   happy   but   i   really   wouldnt   have   cared   but   they   are   not   in   stores   where   i   live   so   i   have   to   order   them   off   amazon ..   thank   you   for   carrying   them ! ! !
pacifier   great ,   i   just   loved   the   baby   mute   button   pacifier !   it   arrived   in   a   timley   manner   in   great   condition   and   looked   even   better   than   described   in   the   ad .
good   deal   i   ordered   these   for   my   newborn   but   when   the   package   arrived   it   was   marked   as   3   6   months .   however   i   received   the   exact   same   brand   as   a   gift   in   the   0   3   month   size   and   i   have   to   say   i   can   t   tell   them   apart .   i   put   all   three   next   to   each   other   and   couldn   t   tell   there   was   a   size   difference   at   all .   they   are   hard   to   see   when   they   fall   on   the   floor   but   we   keep   it   attached   to   a   paci   clip   so   that   hasn   t   been   a   big   issue .   overall   i   m   very   pleased .
not   what   i   was   expecting ..   they   look   similar   to   the   soothie   but   they   arent .   the   nipple   is   way   smaller   than   the   soothie   and   the   material   is   so   heavy   and   my   baby   would   suck   on   it   but   the   second   she   stoped   it   would   fall   out   of   her   mouth   because   it   was   sooo   heavy ..   they   are   cute   tho ! !   just   wish   the   nipple   was   exactly   like   the   soothie   and   it   would   be   perfect ! !
perfect   pacifier !   what   i   love   most   is   the   fact   that   its   one   piece   easy   to   clean ,   br   br   also   these   are   extremely   cheap
good   paci !   these   are   the   only   pacifiers   my   son   will   take !   i   ll   be   honest ,   at   first   i   wasn   t   thrilled   that   my   son   took   to   a   pacifier   at   3   months .   i   just   don   t   like   the   look   of   them   sticking   to   a   baby   s   face !   however ,   i   do   like   that   these   are   clear .   they   serve   the   purpose   of   the   pacifier   which   i   am   so   grateful   for   now !   ,   but   don   t   look   hideous   when   my   son   sucks   on   it !   i   just   wish   they   offered   the   clear   version   in   the   next   size   up   as   well .
great   pacifiers !   these   are   the   only   pacifiers   that   my   baby   likes .   they   look   great   and   the   cap   keeps   the   cleaner   for   longer .   i   wish   there   was   a   way   that   the   cap   could   be   tied   on   paci   grip   because   the   caps   are   easy   to   lose   because   they   are   clear .
make   sure   you   buy   from   this   seller   these   are   great !   my   son   loves   loves   loves   these   they   are   softer   than   the   ones   from   walmart .   they   are   bendy ,   and   he   is   5   months   now ,   but   took   them   well   since   he   was   born .   i   love   the   cut   out   so   it   doesn   t   cover   his   nose ,   like   the   old   ones   from   the   hospital
love   everything   but   the   color   i   ordered   these   pacifiers   for   my   grandson   because   they   were   like   the   older   style   i   had   used   with   my   kids .   they   were   shown   in   blue ,   and   said   colors   may   vary ,   and   i   knew   without   a   doubt ,   we   would   end   up   getting   the   pink   ones .   we   have   a   boy   and   wanted   any   other   color   except   the   pink .   he   does   like   these   pacifier   s   better   than   his   other   ones ,   but   my   daughter   won   t   use   them   when   we   take   him   out   anywhere   in   public .   he   s   only   2   months   old   and   you   can   t   really   tell   if   he   is   a   boy   or   girl   at   this   age .
very   cute   wubbanub .   we   have   other   wubbanubs   but   wanted   something   different .   this   is   a   very   cute   pony   and   matches   many   outfits .   the   baby   likes   this   paddy   just   as   well   as   his   first   one .
best   pacifiers   eco   friendly   and   safe .   my   baby   is   100   breastfed   and   took   these   with   no   hesitation .   he   likes   to   suck   a   lot   and   momma   needed   a   break .   i   love   the   fact   that   these   are   100   natural   hevea   rubber .
breakable   i   was   pretty   disappointed   at   how   breakable   this   is .   it   seems   very   flimsy   and   for   the   price   i   was   not   impressed   at   all .   wish   i   hadn   t   of   purchased   it .
mom   would   make   a   few   changes   my   baby   is   really   calmed   by   this   pacifier ,   which   is   the   most   important   thing !   however   it   s   tough   to   find   a   hygienic   pacifier   holder   since   the   holes   that   are   used   to   attach   to   her   pacifier   clip   are   close   enough   to   her   mouth   that   drool   and   spit   up   get   on   the   clip .   also ,   the   little   handle   could   be   easier   to   grasp ... i   find   myself   holding   it   in   my   teeth   when   i   need   two   hands   to   grab   baby ,   and   since   it   s   not   a   super   obvious   place   to   grab ,   others   sometimes   pick   up   the   pacifier   by   the   nipple   yuck ... why   don   t   you   just   let   baby   lick   your   fingers !   .   as   other   reviewers   mentioned ,   watching   baby   suck   on   this   paci   is   cool ... maybe   sleep   deprivation   makes   this   more   entertaining   to   parents ,   but   even   my   baby   free   friends   get   a   kick   out   of   it .
great   product   makes   diaper   changes   a   breeze   too   my   3   day   old   granddaughter   came   a   little   early   36   weeks ,   5   lb   12   oz   and   she   would   just   gag   on   any   other   pacifier .   the   lamb   is   really   cute   and   it   helps   keep   the   pacifier   in   her   mouth .   highly   recommended .
love   a   nub   my   baby   boy   loves   his   lambie .   so   much   so   that   i   am   purchasing   a   second   one .   br   the   lamb   is   soft   and   cute   and   is   still   going   strong   after   5   months .
very   cute   my   wife   has   wanted   a   serta   sheep   for   years   and   i   finally   got   her   this   little   guy   a   little   while   ago   and   she   loves   it .   it   is   well   made ,   the   price   was   good ,   and   it   is   just   all   around   very   cute .
good   binkies !   first   of   all ,   i   can   t   find   size   3   anywhere   anymore .   i   found   them   here !   i   am   so   glad   i   did   because   my   baby   won   t   use   anything   else .   i   didn   t   get   the   colors   as   pictured   though .   good   quality   overall   though !   i   m   happy
i   thought   this   was   a   pacifier   holder   but   it   s   just   one   piece   we   ordered   this   because   we   wanted   something   that   would   help   hold   our   newborns   existing   soothie   pacifiers   in   her   mouth   which   is   almost   what   this   is .   what   isn   t   clearly   stated   is   that   this   is   all   one   piece   so   it   s   not   something   that   is   going   to   make   the   existing   pacis   work   better .   if   it   did ,   i   d   give   it   5   stars ,   because   everything   else   is   great .   it   works   just   as   described   and   our   8   lb   preemie   holds   onto   it   as   she   sucks .   the   moo   moo   cow   is   absolutely   adorable   and   so   elegant   and   girly .
so   cute ! !   my   daughter   absolutely   loves   these   pacifiers !   she   won   t   take   any   other   kind ,   plus   they   are   super   cute .....   we   have   the   giraffe   and   pink   pony   as   well   and   i   am   always   getting   compliments   on   them .
good   for   a   laugh   i   bought   this   partly   for   the   fun   aspect   not   expecting   my   baby   to   like   it .   i   let   him   look   at   himself   in   the   mirror   and   he   was   laughing   nonstop !
the   only   pacifiers   our   baby   will   use !   we   received   all   brands   of   pacifiers   from   friends   and   family   at   our   baby   shower .   they   must   have   known   something   that   we   did   not !   my   parents   never   used   pacifiers   with   me   or   any   of   my   siblings ,   so   i   wasn   t   completely   convinced   of   their   necessity   until   we   discovered   that   we   have   a   colicky   baby !   we   are   now   masters   of   the   5   s   s   swing ,   swaddle ,   shhh ,   stomach   side ,   and   suck .   consequently ,   we   ve   tried   all   the   different   pacifiers   that   we   were   given , and   the   only   ones   that   our   baby   consistently   accepts   are   the   gumdrop   pacifiers .   we   would   all   be   miserable   without   them !
it   s   ok .   i   like   that   this   is   one   piece   and   it   s   a   cute   color   but   with   my   baby   2   months   old   ,   he   has   trouble   keeping   it   in   his   mouth   especially   compared   to   the   nuk   pacis .
great ,   great   i   m   super   happy   with   my   purchase .   its   way   better   than   what   its   describe   as   .   its   super   cute ,   great   quality   ,   it   came   with   the   pacifier   it   arrived   on   time .   i   would   love   to   buy   more   super   satisfied .   perfect   size   for   a   baby .
my   son   loves   his   giraffe   paci !   when   i   saw   this   pacifier   attacher ,   i   thought   it   was   the   cutest   thing   ever !   honestly ,   i   didn   t   want   my   son   using   a   pacifier   past   six   months   old ,   but   i   m   picking   my   battles .   i   ordered   this   when   he   was   about   four   months   old .   when   he   was   about   five   months   old ,   he   was   able   to   put   the   paci   in   his   mouth   by   himself .   i   think   having   the   giraffe   attached   to   it   made   it   easier   for   him .   this   all   translates   into   longer   naps   and   more   sleep   at   night .   we   get   so   many   compliments   on   how   cute   this   thing   is .   i   think   when   we   re   ready   to   wean   him   off   of   the   paci   we   will   cut   it   off   and   still   let   him   play   with   the   giraffe .   but   seriously ,   he   loves   it !
helps   with   colicky   baby   my   son   loves   this   teddy .   it   puts   him   to   sleep   and   soothes   him .   it   also   helps   him   stay   in   a   deep   sleep .   sometimes   if   i   shut   it   off   too   soon   he   will   wake   up   instantly   and   cry .   best   20   i   ve   spent   in   a   while ! ! ! ! !
the   only   pacifier   our   son   will   use   our   son   is   exclusively   breastfed   and   i   was   concerned   about   giving   him   a   pacifier .   we   waiter   a   few   weeks   after   birth   and   tried   the   soothie .   he   took   to   it   immediately   and   now   uses   it   to   fall   asleep   for   naps .   br   br   since   buying   it ,   i   ve   tried   introducing   other   pacifiers .   nope ,   no   go .   only   soothie   will   do .
good   price ,   solid   product   pacifiers   were   as   i   expected   them   to   be .   good   price   for   a   busy   mom   who   can   t   always   make   it   out   to   the   store   after   the   puppy   eats   another   binky .
works   great !   once   my   newborn   reaches   a   deep   sleep ,   i   place   him   in   his   pack   n   play   with   this   bear   in   the   corner   with   the   volume   on   low .   this   bear   works   great   for   keeping   him   asleep   and   the   sound   isn   t   nearly   as   obnoxious   as   some   of   the   lullaby   music   that   we   have   to   listen   to   on   his   swing .   i   would   definitely   recommend   this   because   it   s   super   cute   baby   s   first   teddy   and   it   works   for   my   baby !
so   cute !   bought   this   little   bear   for   my   baby   because   she   was   having   a   hard   time   keeping   the   soothie   in   her   mouth   without   someone   holding   it .   she   sleeps   with   it   at   night   and   even   when   she   doesn   t   use   the   paci   she   falls   asleep   cuddling   it !   so   cute ! !
love   this   item   but   info   was   wrong   we   got   one   of   these   at   my   baby   shower   and   absolutely   love   it .   naturally ,   having   only   one   was   a   bit   difficult   after   awhile .   after   searching   online   for   more   we   came   across   it   on   amazon .   in   the   description   it   says   colors   may   vary   and   that   you   may   receive   the   item   in   pink ,   green   or   orange .   this   was   perfect ,   since   we   have   a   little   girl ,   so   i   ordered   two .   when   they   arrived   at   my   house   this   morning   they   are   both   blue ! !   if   blue   had   been   an   option   i   would   have   put   a   note   on   the   order   screen .   i   was   really   hoping   for   a   pink   and   an   orange   or   at   the   very   least   two   different   colors .   this   is   very   disappointing .
it   s   so   small !   love   it !   this   arrived   in   the   mail   yesterday   my   daughter   is   due   in   5   weeks   and   i   ve   read   so   many   great   reviews   on   these   little   things   that   i   just   had   to   buy   one   for   her .   when   it   came   i   was   surprised   at   how   small   it   really   is !   br   br   when   you   look   at   photos   of   other   people   s   photos   of   their   babies   holding   these   they   look   pretty   decent   in   size ,   like   this   would   be   something   that   baby   could   use   as   a   stuffed   animal   in   a   year   or   so ,   once   they   are   off   a   pacifier .   we   ordered   the   lamb   one ,   and   with   the   pacifier   off   of   it   it   ll   just   take   a   few   scissor   snips   to   take   it   off   ,   it   looks   like   it   could   be   a   toy   for   a   dog !   br   br   it   s   so   darn   cute   and   tiny   though ...   my   8lb   poodle   saw   it   come   out   of   the   bag   an   immediately   sat   in   front   of   me ,   thinking   it   was   a   new   toy   for   her .   we   ve   put   it   in   the   nursery   and   now   she   sits   at   the   door   waiting   to   go   in   so   she   can   try   and   find   it .   haha !   i   will   update   this   after   baby   arrives   and   we   have   a   chance   to   use   it ,   but   i   am   hopeful   that   it   will   be   a   big   success !   br   br   update   9   14   12   br   br   my   daughter   is   7   weeks   now   and   she   loves   this   thing .   we   recently   took   it   on   a   trip   to   ca ,   and   i   make   sure   it   s   always   in   her   diaper   bag   when   we   leave   the   house .   we   also   have   the   blue   bear   one   of   these   that   stays   at   home   as   well .   it   s   been   great   to   keep   it   in   her   mouth   when   sleeping   she   s   a   tummy   sleeper   ,   and   when   in   the   baby   carrier ,   i   don   t   have   to   worry   about   her   dropping   it   and   losing   it   in   the   carrier !   br   br   also   our   cousin   has   about   9   of   these   ones   for   his   son ,   and   they   love   them   as   well !
love   em   we   love   these   binks .   i   also   like   that   with   the   size   2 ,   gunk   doesn   t   build   up   around   the   base   of   the   nipple .   stays   very   clean .
my   daughter   loves   her   pacis   my   daughter   was   always   a   bit   of   a   pacifier   addict   but   once   we   switched   from   soothies   to   these   at   about   5   months ,   she   didnt   want   to   let   them   go .   the   other   amazing   thing   is   that   with   the   loop   on   the   back   she   can   carry   them   around   on   her   own   very   easily   and   when   she   was   smaller ,   the   bulb   style   ones   made   it   much   harder   for   her   paci   to   fall   out   and   wake   her   up .   my   daughter   is   now   10   months   old   and   has   been   through   many   of   these .   i   know   they   aren   t   as   cute   in   color   but   being   natural   and   seeing   how   much   she   loves   them   has   encouraged   me   to   continue   to   purchase   them .   now   i   just   have   to   figure   out   how   to   get   her   to   not   want   them   anymore   since   she   is   almost   1

hard   to   find   but   not   here   it   is   hard   to   find   the   silicone   pacifiers   in   the   biggest   size ,   but   not   on   amazon .   my   son   refuses   to   use   the   latex   kind .   this   is   his   favorite .   now   we   just   need   to   figure   out   how   to   break   the   habit .
great   product   i   bought   this   after   i   had   received   the   lamb   one   as   a   gift   and   loved   it .   i   think   the   lamb   one   is   actually   better   but   i   still   like   the   puppy .   this   one   is   just   a   little   more   awkward   than   the   lamb   and   the   colors   are   more   yellow ,   not   brown   as   it   appears   in   the   picture .   overall   though ,   i   think   these   wubbanub   pacifiers   are   great   products   and   a   necessity   during   the   early   months .   i   like   that   i   can   tuck   the   stuffed   animal   into   my   sons   car   seat   straps   to   hold   it   in   place .   it   s   also   nice   that   it   lays   on   his   chest   when   not   strapped   into   anything   and   i   don   t   have   to   constantly   push   the   pacifier   back   into   his   mouth   like   you   do   with   regular   pacifiers .   his   little   hand   can   also   grab   onto   the   stuffed   animal   easily .
thank   god   for   wubbanubs .   really !   my   son   lovesssss   wubbanubs .   he   has   four   different   ones ,   and   the   blue   pony   is   his   absolute   favorite .   this   thing   is   literally   always   hanging   out   of   his   mouth .   he   loves   to   crawl   around   with   not   only   the   paci   part   in   his   mouth ,   but   varies   between   the   legs   and   tail   as   well .   it   hilarous   looking   at   him   with   the   pony   hanging   out   of   his   mouth   by   a   leg .   i   have   to   wash   it   at   least   every   3   4   days ,   due   to   how   dirty   it   gets   with   him   constant   use .   i   just   throw   it   in   the   washing   machine ,   and   its   been   fine .   when   i   hold   this   wubbanub   up ,   his   eyes   light   up   and   he   snatches   it   out   of   my   hands .   this   wubby ,   as   we   call   it ,   has   saved   us   on   many   car   trips   and   meltdowns .   i   picked   it   up   as   an   impulse   buy   and   i   m   so   thankful   i   did !
safety   hazard !   my   daughter   loves   these   pacifiers   but   i   am   going   to   have   to   get   rid   of   them .   she   was   dozing   happily   and   screaming   the   next   moment .   i   rushed   over   to   see   what   was   wrong   and   found   her   finger   wedged   in   one   of   the   four   holes !   i   had   to   pry   it   off   her   finger   was   jammed   in   there   so   tight !   her   finger   was   bright   red   and   she   was   upset   for   ages .   what   kind   of   a   design   is   that !   they   know   babies   with   little   fingers   will   be   touching   the   pacifier ...   so   they   put   baby   finger   traps   on   the   pacifier   !   awful !   br   br   also   as   others   have   said ,   water   from   washing   gets   trapped   inside   the   nipple ,   creating   a   bacteria   risk .
very   cute   the   item   came   as   described   a   day   late   but   hey   that   is   the   postal   system .   the   pacifier   appears   to   be   baby   safe   and   came   with   a   plastic   guard   over   the   mouth   piece .
only   pacifier   my   breastfed   baby   will   take ! !   i   got   a   few   of   the   gumdrop   pacifiers   from   the   hospital   when   my   daughter   was   born   4   months   ago   and   i   love   them .   she   s   not   a   paci   addict   like   my   son   was   so   it   helps   to   have   the   hole   that   i   can   stick   my   finger   in   to   help   her   grip   it .   we   still   have   a   few   unused   from   the   hospital   but   i   wanted   to   buy   some   in   different   colors .   br   br   note   i   tried   the   nuk   pacifiers   too   because   we   received   some   at   our   shower   but   she   would   not   even   keep   them   in   her   mouth .   i   don   t   think   she   liked   the   shape   of   the   nipple .
it   is   not   practical   for   cleaning   it   is   not   easy   to   clean ,   and   usually   pacifiers   need   to   be   cleaned   several   times   a   day ,   but   this   one   is   attached   to   the   duck
nice ,   easy   to   use ,   but   portability   is   limited   this   is   pretty   easy   to   use .   just   put   in   batteries ,   place   the   pacifier   on   top ,   push   down   and   wait   till   the   germ   killing   light   goes   off .   it   s   nice   to   be   able   to   use   it   when   a   binkie   falls   on   the   germy   floor !   br   br   my   only   complaint   is   that   it   s   not   really   designed   to   take   with   you   in   a   diaper   bag   or   purse   the   hard   plastic   could   potentially   break ,   but   more   importantly   the   lid   is   very   easy   to   flip   open   and   it   could   probably   be   levered   into   a   position   where   it   snaps   off   as   a   result .   br   br   nice   addition   to   a   nursery ,   though !
not   as   pictured ...   works   as   well   as   other   wubs ,   but   not   as   cute   as   pictured .   the   giraffe   has   a   longer ,   flimsy   neck   and   different   coloring   pattern .   my   baby   still   likes   and   uses   it   though .
at   a   loss   i   gave   this   product   a   4   star   rating   because   we   didn   t   have   it   long   enough   to   figure   out   how   it   worked .   i   got   this   for   my   grandchild .   she   is   very   finicky   and   for   some   reason   likes   to   spit   her   pacifier   out   of   her   mouth .   i   honestly   thinks   that   she   likes   to   see   up   jump   for   it .   at   any   rate ,   once   she   does   this ,   we   rinse   the   pacifier   and   put   in   the   sterilizer ,   however ,   after   having   it   for   only   a   few   days   it   was   destroyed .   my   granddaughter   wanted   to   play   another   game   of   catch   the   binky   and   when   she   spit   it   out ,   her   mother   s   knee   jerk   reaction   was   to   try   to   catch   the   pacifier   before   it   went   to   the   floor ,   however ,   in   the   process ,   she   knocked   over   the   sterilizer   and   the   plastic   shattered   to   pieces .   so ,   i   think   it   would   be   unfair   to   ding   a   product   for   something   that   was   caused   by   human   error .   from   what   i   could   tell ,   the   product   did   what   it   was   designed   for ,   but   i   cannot   be   100   certain .   sorry   guys .
cute ,   but   not   the   most   popular   shower   gift   for   the   price ,   i   was   a   little   disappointed   that   this   felt   and   looked   kind   of   flimsy .   nonetheless ,   i   figure   if   it   does   what   it   says ,   nice ,   right   however ,   the   friend   i   gave   it   to   admitted   that   it   s   gone   pretty   much   unused   she   always   has   an   extra   pacifier   in   her   bag ,   and   she   just   throws   the   other   one   in   the   side   pocket   to   be   put   in   the   dishwasher   at   home .   i   can   understand   once   i   look   at   it   like   another   reviewer   mentioned ,   it   can   t   be   used   on   its   side   like   just   activated   and   thrown   in   the   diaper   bag   .   because   it   has   to   be   on   a   level   surface ,   it   s   not   really   that   great   for   using   on   the   go   unless   you   have   time   to   wait   like   at   a   coffee   shop   or   restaurant ,   friend   s   house ,   etc .   according   to   my   pal ,   those   trips   require   so   much   packing   anyway   that   an   extra   binky   is   a   must ,   making   this   a   little   inconvenient .   i   think   if   it   could   be   used   in   a   more   portable   manner ,   it   d   be   more   useful .
amazing   paci   clip   unique ,   fun ,   ad   functional .   better   than   the   cheap   o   fabric   velcro   ones !   i   bought   a   few   different   styles   of   the   bink   links   and   they   are   all   very   cute .   especially   nice   because   they   will   fit   through   the   holes   of   the   big   soothie   pacis .
love   it ! ! !   i   got   this   for   my   10   month   old   son .   i   wasn   t   sure   if   he   would   like   it   because   this   is   not   the   brand   of   pacifier   he   normally   uses   but   he   loves   it ! !   i   plan   on   getting   him   more !
portable   and   fairly   easy   to   use   this   is   a   feel   safe   type   product .   just   another   precaution   to   take   to   make   sure   things   are   clean   before   you   stick   them   into   your   baby   s   mouth .   br   br   the   problem   with   these   type   items   is   that   you   never   know   if   they   are   doing   their   job   as   advertised .   you   have   to   trust   that   they   are .   br   br   it   took   a   while   to   figure   out   how   to   open   this   thing   and   get   it   working .   not   sure   why   it   was   so   complicated ,   or   seemed   to   be .   but   once   i   figured   it   out   it   was   easy   to   use   after .   br   br   very   small   to   carry   around   with   you   and   if   you   want   to   feel   a   bit   more   safe   then   take   the   few   seconds   to   put   that   pacifier   through   the   sterilizer   for   that   secure   feeling .
favorite   pacifier   i   love   this   pacifier .   the   fact   that   it   s   one   piece   is   great !   easy   to   keep   clean   and   it   s   safe   for   baby !
great !   these   are   really   great .   daughter   loves   them .   the   only   thing   is   that   a   little   water   gets   in   it   when   you   wash   them ,   but   i   think   that   happens   with   all   pacifiers .   they   are   cute   and   do   the   trick .   they   don   t   leave   a   mark   on   the   face   like   the   nuks   do .
cheaply   made   but   portable   ok ,   so   the   materials   that   make   up   this   device   isn   t   the   best .   it   feels   flimsy ,   like   it   would   break   easily .   it   s   small   enough   that   you   can   take   this   around   with   you   where   ever   you   go .   you   just   push   a   button   and   it   tells   you   if   the   pacificer   has   been   sterialized .   like   other   reviewers ,   if   there   s   way   to   actually   know   if   this   little   cheap   feeling   device   actually   does   what   it   say ,   i   m   all   good .   anyways ,   i   m   giving   this   review   assuming ,   the   green   light   actually   translates   to   being   sterilized .
the   timer   does   not   work   timer   does   not   work   at   all .   volume   has   basically   2   settings   high   and   very   high .   br   would   get   more   stars   if   it   were   cheaper .
love   these   pacis !   i   love   these   rubber   pacifiers !   i   love   that   they   are   chemical   free   come   from   a   natural   plant ,   the   rubber   tree ,   vs   being   manufactured   like   silicon .   my   little   one   loves   to   suck   on   these !
a   little   upset   this   pacifier   did   get   delivered   on   time , however   i   ordered   it   in   black , and   the   invoice   that   came   with   it   also   specified   black   yet   a   white   one   was   sent . i   dont   have   the   time   to   send   it   back   because   the   baby   is   on   its   way   i   m   just   too   busy . after   spending   10   on   a   pacifier   you   would   think   upon   shipping   the   item   would   of   been   double   checked   especially   since   it   was   the   only   item   ordered . what   makes   it   worse   is   that   i   had   already   purchased   a   white   one   from   a   different   seller . so   now   i   have  
beary   beary   cute !   i   bought   this   and   a   couple   of   other   designs   for   my   niece   that   i   will   be   visiting   soon .   it   is   adorable !   i   hope   she   loves   the   functionality   of   it   as   much   as   i   ll   love   looking   at   her   using   it .   i   really   like   the   fact   that   it   is   machine   washable .   i   m   going   to   suggest   to   the   momma   to   either   keep   it   in   the   memory   box   when   the   baby   outgrows   using   it .
cool   design ,   and   my   daughter   likes   these .   these   pacifiers   are   well   designed   and   my   daughter   likes   them !   however ,   the   style   and   colors   may   vary   is   not   really   nice   if   you   are   buying   a   gift   and   want   something   specific .   but   it   does   not   really   matter   if   you   are   buying   for   every   day   use   by   your   kids   since   all   designs   are   acceptable .
adorable !   can   t   wait   to   give   as   gift .   i   bought   this   and   a   couple   of   other   designs   for   my   niece   that   i   will   be   visiting   soon .   it   is   adorable !   i   hope   she   loves   the   functionality   of   it   as   much   as   i   ll   love   looking   at   her   using   it .   i   really   like   the   fact   that   it   is   machine   washable .   i   m   going   to   suggest   to   the   momma   to   either   keep   it   in   the   memory   box   when   the   baby   outgrows   using   it .
great   pacifiers   i   tried   tommee   timpee   and   this   other   generic   paci .   my   daughter   didn   t   like .   my   niece   showed   me   a   pic   of   her   friend   s   son   w   this   paci   and   said   her   friend   only   uses   this   because   he   loves   it .   i   remembered   this   was   the   type   they   used   in   the   hospital   and   she   loved .   i   brought   a   pack   of   two   for   her   and   she   loves   them .   i   didn   t   know   they   had   different   colors .   i   m   going   to   order   the   pink   and   purple   since   she   s   a   girl .   these   pacis   are   a   life   saver .
daughter   loves   these !   these   are   the   only   pacifiers   my   daughter   will   take ,   and   they   are   hard   to   find   nowadays .   you   don   t   get   to   choose   specific   colors ,   but   who   cares   your   baby   couldn   t   care   less   about   what   color   their   sucky   is ,   but   if   you   re   the   type   who   gets   butt   hurt   if   you   don   t   get   everything   the   same   color   or   if   your   boy   has   a   pink   paci ,   look   elsewhere !
cute   idea ,   not   practical   we   bought   this   pacifier   to   go   with   my   baby   s   first   halloween   costume .   he   was   a   bat ,   so   we   added   the   paci   to   make   him   a   vampire   bat .   it   s   cute ,   but   very   heavy .   it   has   the   same   nipple   as   a   nuk   brand   pacifier .   also ,   it   is   not   purple   like   the   picture   shows .   the   lips   and   tongue   are   red .   i   wish   it   really   was   purple   since   my   baby   s   costume   was   black   and   purple .
the   only   pacifiers   my   daughter   would   use   we   tried   a   few   different   types   of   pacifiers   before   these .   these   were   the   only   ones   that   my   daughter   would   use ,   so   we   bought   a   bunch   of   them .   they   last   well   through   washes   and   sterilization .
amazing   this   pacifier   is   beautiful ! !   i   bought   it   for   my   girlfriend   and   she   absolutely   loves   it ! !   she   thinks   its   the   cutest   thing   in   the   world !   i   will   definitely   be   buying   more   from   this   buyer !   shipped   fast   and   had   zero   problems
vampire   costume   we   had   basically   weaned   my   two   year   old   of   the   pacifier   but   we   bought   this   one   to   use   for   his   halloween   costume .   it   made   the   whole   costume   and   was   completely   adorable .   we   got   lots   of   comments ,   and   since   he   already   liked   pacifiers ,   he   had   no   trouble   keeping   it   in   his   mouth .   he   was   pretty   much   the   cutest   vampire   ever .   br   br   we   only   used   it   for   that   purpose   and   thankfully   our   big   boy   had   no   trouble   giving   these   up   for   good   after !  
very   funny ...   very   funny ... my   nephew   loves   to   walk   with   this   pacifier   around   and   besides   it   is   very   hard   so   it   doesn   t   break .
very   funny ...   it   is   very   funny   to   see   my   nephew   walking   around   with   this   pacifier ,   he   loves   it   and   it   doesn   t   break   when   it   falls   down .
greatest   pacifier   ever   i   love   these   pacifiers .   my   son   was   born   into   the   nicu   and   was   given   the   same   pacifier .   i   thought   it   was   big   and   ugly ,   so   i   tried   to   get   him   to   use   the   smaller   ones ,   he   refused .   i   found   these   one   day   and   loved   the   different   animals   on   the   end .   i   throw   the   whole   item   in   the   washer   and   dryer ,   then   wash   off   the   pacifier   with   soap   and   water   before   i   give   it   to   my   son .   he   loved   it ,   he   would   hold   on   to   it   s   arms   and   pluck   it   into   his   mouth   when   just   a   few   months   old .   then   when   i   no   longer   wanted   him   to   use   a   pacifier ,   i   cut   it   away   and   he   was   still   able   to   comfort   himself   with   the   stuffed   animal .   they   also   make   great   gifts !
cute   but   logo   wore   off   within   a   week   of   use   being   huge   sox   fans ,   my   husband   and   i   were   super   excited   to   receive   these   as   a   gift .   these   seemed   great   at   first ,   especially   since   my   2   month   old   took   to   them   almost   immediately .   he   has   a   hard   time   keeping   the   paci   in   his   mouth   by   himself   but   he   is   able   to   keep   these   in   his   mouth   on   his   own .   however ,   we   were   pretty   bummed   out   when   the   red   sox   logo   started   to   wear   off   almost   immediately .   by   the   end   of   the   first   week   of   use ,   both   pacifiers   had   just   a   blank   white   button .   i   didn   t   do   any   type   of   excessive   cleaning ,   just   soap   and   water .   my   son   still   prefers   these   over   his   other   pacifiers   but   it   s   too   bad   about   the   logo .
used   to   teach   my   preemie   to   suck   i   purchased   these   planning   on   not   using   them   until   late   summer   after   i   had   established   breastfeeding   with   my   son .   however ,   he   arrived   5   weeks   early   and   with   a   very   weak   sucking   reflex ,   so   we   have   used   these   to   help   teach   him   how   to   suck .   the   hospital   had   the   soothie   type   pacifiers ,   but   my   son   never   figured   out   that   he   was   supposed   to   suck   on   it .   it   seemed   too   stiff   for   his   weak   suck   reflex .   compared   to   the   mam   pacifiers   we   used   with   my   older   son ,   i   like   the   design   of   these   much   better .   they   seem   to   fit   better   in   my   son   s   mouth ,   especially   being   much   smaller .   br   br   we   initially   used   them   right   before   i   would   breastfeed   him   to   get   him   practice   sucking   and   then   quickly   transfer   him   to   the   breast .   in   addition ,   we   have   used   them   for   very   brief   periods   of   time   like   diaper   changes   or   baths   when   he   gets   very   upset ,   as   he   tends   to   gulp   air   and   then   spit   up   more .   br   br   since   my   son   was   premature   and   is   just   now   breastfeeding   well ,   we   are   slowly   using   these   less   and   less ,   but   will   likely   reintroduce   them   when   he   is   a   little   older .   br   br   my   only   complaint   so   far   is   that   i   had   no   idea   what   colors   we   would   be   receiving .   i   was   actually   hoping   for   more   gender   neutral   and   we   ended   up   with   bright   primary   colors   that   would   have   worked   for   a   boy   or   a   girl ,   but   some   color   selections   would   be   nice .   i   really   appreciate   that   these   don   t   have   gendered   pictures   or   sayings   on   them .
baby   loves   it !   we   love   our   wubbanub !   it   s   great   for   my   son   who   s   not   all   into   binkys ,   but   when   he   s   tired   the   likes   to   have   this   guy   around   to   hold   on   to .   his   old   binky   would   fall   out   of   his   mouth   and   wake   him   up .   if   this   falls ,   he   just   grabs   it ,   puts   it   back   in   and   falls   right   back   to   sleep !   makes   a   great   shower   gift ,   too .
like   a   carnival   toy   very   unhappy   with   the   quality   of   this   bear .   every   time   it   is   touched   fur   comes   off   in   clumps .   the   auto   off   function   does   not   work .   the   eyes   are   not   safe   for   babies   and   could   be   pulled   off .   this   item   is   not   safe   for   to   have   around   a   baby !
great   pacifiers   gumdrop   pacifiers   were   the   ones   my   daughter   was   sent   home   with   from   the   hospital   and   the   only   ones   she   would   take   from   then   on   lol   they   work   great   and   without   them   i   dont   think   she   would   have   ever   soothed   herself   back   to   sleep   on   those   restless   nights   lol .
we   love   these   pacies !   my   family   and   i   love   these   pacifiers   because   they   are   all   one   piece .   they   are ,   sanitary ,   easy   to   clean ,   no   hard   pieces   and   all   natural .
my   babies   wouldn   t   take   them   we   got   one   of   these   both   times   at   the   hospital   with   our   babies ,   and   we   took   them   home   we   don   t   use   pacifiers   in   the   first   few   weeks   until   breastfeeding   is   going   well   .   i   tried   to   use   them   with   our   babies   multiple   times   but   could   never   get   either   of   them   to   like   them .   i   wanted   to   use   them   because   of   the   safer   plastic   and   the   ease   of   cleaning ,   but   i   found   my   babies   would   not   keep   them   in .   my   daughter   won   t   do   a   pacifier   at   all ,   but   my   son   preferred   the   mams .   i   like   that   these   are   shaped   more   like   the   nipple   of   a   breast ,   and   i   use   these   are   work   i   m   a   peer   counselor   at   wic   to   help   babies   with   suck   issues   when   we   are   trying   to   help   them   breastfeed .
great   pacifier   but   too   addictive   my   17   month   old   son   loves   this   pacifier   however   the   problem   is   that   it   is   addictive !   babies   love   it   so   they   don   t   want   to   be   separate   from   it   and   he   is   contstantly   asking   for   it .   it   was   the   first   pacifier   he   was   introduced   to   so   her   will   not   take   any   other   pacifier .   this   is   a   huge   headache   because   its   very   hard   to   find   them   in   some   stores   and   when   we   lost   it   while   on   vacation   we   had   a   very   very   hard   day .   even   though   it   is   the   best   pacifier   and   the   most   satisfying   for   children   i   will   not   buy   it   again   for   my   future   kids   because   its   so   hard   to   find   them   and   different   from   other   pacifiers   so   if   your   child   likes   this   one   they   won   t   take   any   other .
awesome !   only   reason   it   doesn   t   get   5   stars   is   that   the   paci   does   not   detach   for   cleaning .   lo   loves   it   so   much ! ! ! !
very   cute   and   seemingly   practical   product   but   it   did   not   work   for   us .   i   m   a   little   jealous   that   many   reviewers   say   that   their   kids   took   to   this   immediately !   not   my   son .   he   looked   at   it   with   a   little   bit   of   interest ,   put   it   in   his   mouth   and   tossed   it   on   the   floor !   i   tried   to   leave   it   his   play   pen ,   crib ,   take   it   on   car   rides   but   he   did   not   show   any   interest   at   all   and   so   it   went   to   the   oh   well   i   tried   pile   and   that   s   for   that .   in   all   fairness ,   i   would   like   to   add   that   perhaps   it   would   work   if   we   started   our   son   on   this   right   from   the   get   go   instead   of   introducing   it   after   his   regular   pacifier   because   he   seems   to   like   one   particular   brand   of   pacifiers   and   the   one   day   i   bought   a   different   type   that   was   shaped   to   fit   his   mouth   better   it   promptly   flew   to   the   floor .
great   paci !   we   have   used   these   pacifiers   for   several   little   ones   they   are   definitely   our   favorite   pacifiers .   the   babies   were   very   happy   with   them !
how   cute   is   this ! ! !   i   ordered   the   wubbanub   monkey   for   my   expecting   daughter   in   law .   she   has   decided   my   grandson   s   nickname   is   going   to   be   lil   monkey .   i   thought   this   would   be   a   perfect   little   gift   to   add   to   my   growing   collection   of   gifts   for   my   first   grandbaby .   my   daughter   in   law   loves ,   loves ,   loves   this   monkey .   she   said   it   was   her   favorite   gift   at   her   recent   baby   shower .   even   though   my   grandson   is   not   born   yet ,   i   am   sure   this   pacifier   will   always   be   his   favorite .
boston   red   sox   baby   set   this   boston   red   sox   baby   set   was   such   a   delight   to   give   as   a   gift .   the   whole   set   is   very   cute   and   hard   to   find   in   stores .   i   am   very   pleased   with   the   whole   set   and   will   be   back   when   we   need   another   baby   gift .
adorablei   love   it ! !   this   pacifier   is   adorable ! !   i   really   loved   it ,   the   caption   says   it   all !   good   price   good   quality .   amazon   always !
my   son   loves   his   monkey   wubbanub !   my   3   1   2   month   old   has   been   attached   to   his   monkey   since   he   was   about   3   weeks   old .   he   doesnt   need   use   the   pacifier   for   longer   than   a   few   minutes ,   but   his   face   lights   up   when   he   sees   his   monkey .   when   he   started   day   care   i   made   sure   it   went   with   him   so   that   he   would   having   something   familiar   and   comforting   with   him   during   the   day .   it   has   defintely   helped   him   develop   his   dexterity   and   can   easily   reach   for   handle   the   monkey .
not   worth   the   worry   i   simply   must   agree   with   the   other   reviews   i   genuinely   do   not   know   if   this   product   works .   i   wish   i   owned   one   of   those   csi   black   light   contaminant   detectors   and   then   i   could   definitively   report   my   findings .   in   the   meantime ,   i   found   myself   reluctant   to   use   a   human   subject   for   this   trial .   as   in ,   if   the   baby   gets   sick ,   then   we   can   report   that   the   pipila   does   not   properly   sanitize .   that   s   not   an   option .   it   is   awfully   small ,   awfully   light ,   and   awfully   inexpensive   ...   however ,   i   could   say   the   same   about   the   sonicare   sanitizers   and   those   do   work !   br   br   what   surprised   me   was   how   convenient   the   pipila   is .   it   is   much ,   much   smaller   than   i   expected   like   really   small   .   likewise ,   it   adds   virtually   no   weight   to   the   diaper   bag   but ,   yes ,   its   spherical   construction   does   consume   much   needed   space   .   conversely ,   for   a   travel   item ,   it   does   seem   a   bit   fragile   and   i   see   numerous   reports   of   breakage   here   .   br   br   here   is   my   opinion   carry   an   extra   pacifier   or   two   in   the   diaper   bag   just   in   case   one   drops   on   the   floor   and   sterilize   them   with   your   bottles   at   home .   it   will   give   you   much   more   peace   of   mind .
i   think   it   works   i   push   down   the   button   and   the   little   light   comes   on .   that   means   it   s   working ,   right   well ,   i   can   t   honestly   be   sure   because   there   is   no   way   to   test   whether   the   pacifier   is   steralized   or   not .   what   i   do   know ,   however ,   is   steralization   does   not   equal   clean .   a   dirty   pacifier   can   be   put   in   this   gizmo   and   come   out   just   as   dirty .   so   if   there   is   dried   milk   or   anything   else   on   the   pacifier ,   clean   it   first .   br   br   regarding   the   steralizer   s   construction ,   it   appears   fairly   simplistic ,   maybe   even   cheap .   plastic   parts   that   just   scream   easily   broken   appear   to   constitute   the   entire   device ,   but   i   could   be   wrong   because   i   m   not   going   to   waste   time   reverse   engineering   it .   br   br   it   s   peace   of   mind ,   nothing   more .
versatile   and   worry   free   but   make   sure   you   get   a   pacifier   holder   that   is   compatible   with   this   type   of   pacifier   .   br   it   is   as   titled ,   a   soother   that   leaves   parents   worrying   not   about   orthodontic   problems   later   on .   br   there   is   a   good   reason   why   modern   hospitals   are   equipped   with   these .   br   bonus ,   also   serves   as   a   good   early   teether   mmm ,   chewy .
color   read   closely .   i   did   not   realize   they   send   you   whatever   color   they   want   and   i   wanted   the   blue   in   the   picture .   disappointing
arms   are   super   short   the   arms   on   the   bear   are   too   short .   the   bear   is   also   pretty   fully   stuffed   which   means   the   combo   of   short   arms   and   heavy   bear   the   bear   pulls   the   bink   out   rather   than   help   it   stay   in .
u   of   m   pacifiers !   bought   these   for   my   new   great   nephew .   from   what   i   understand ,   these   are   good   ones   .   something   about   the   inside   construction .   anyway ,   these   are   his   favorites ,   of   course .   br   br   go   blue !

we   like   it !   not   crazy   about   the   color   but   after   a   over   a   month   of   use ,   we   really   like   this   product .   i   m   a   huge   germ   phobe .   i   carry   hand   wipes   like   to   sanitize   everything !   it   fits   well   in   the   diaper   bag   and   so   it   goes   everywhere .   i   have   had   no   problems   with   mine .   we   use   the   energizer   rechargeables   and   it   still   was   working   up   to   a   little   over   a   dozen   uses .   the   price   is   a   little   steep   in   my   opinion   but   i   m   glad   we   have   it !
best   paci   for   babies   with   chubby   cheeks .   my   daughter   has   really   chubby   cheeks .   as   an   infant ,   the   sides   of   paci   s   would   almost   cut   into   her   cheeks .   but   these   particular   pacis   don   t .   they   curve   away   from   the   face   a   bit .   so   much   more   comfortable .   they   leave   no   lines   on   her   face .   these   are   the   only   pacis   that   i   ve   found   that   curve   away .   the   clear   color   is   hard   to   find   once   dropped .   so   stock   up ! ! !
save   your   money ! !   this   is   the   first   review   that   i   ve   had   to   put   in   all   caps .   if   i   could   prevent   another   parent   from   saving   their   hard   earned   money   then   i   m   going   to   try   doing   so .   i   m   a   mom   of   a   now   4   month   old   and   saving   money   is   my   business .   yes   i   got   this   for   free   and   it   s   a   good   thing   i   did   because   it   would   have   been   back   in   the   mail   to   amazon   within   a   week   which   is   all   of   what   it   lasted   while   i   had   it .   br   br   yes   it   s   a   great   idea   but   unfortunately   they   didn   t   make   a   great   product .   does   it   actually   sterilize   your   baby   s   pacifier   i   m   not   entirely   sure   that   it   really   does .   br   br   it   s   pretty   simple   to   use .   you   do   need   2   aaa   batteries   that   are   not   included .   you   put   your   baby   s   pacifier   in   the   compartment ,   close   the   lid   and   the   uv   light   comes   on .   it   turns   off   after   about   3   minutes   and   it   claims   that   the   pacifier   is   clean .   i   d   stick   with   inserting   this   in   your   avent   steam   or   electric   sterilizer   or   boiling   it   in   a   pan   of   water .   i   must   also   say   that   its   kind   of   bulky   so   if   you   have   a   very   small   baby   bag   this   might   not   be   what   you   want   to   take   with   you .   instead   get   some   of   those   baby   pacifier   wipes .   i   have   a   asin   b001dkhpd6   ju   ju   be   be   all   diaper   bag ,   lotus   lullaby   and   it   took   up   quite   a   bit   of   space .   br   br   i   m   also   really   getting   very   skeptical   about   those   5   star   vine   reviews .   did   any   of   them   really   use   the   product   for   more   than   one   day   i   d   go   with   the   amazon   verified   purchased   reviews .   none   of   them   gave   it   5   and   barely   any   4 .   goes   to   show   you   exactly   what   kind   of   product   this   really   is .
soft   and   transitions   nicely   from   regular   bottle   nipples   our   baby   has   used   these   since   birth ... he   is   15   mos   old   and   still   in   love   with   his   paci .   they   are   soft   and   flexible   in   his   mouth   easy   to   attach   to   most   paci   holders ,   and   are   nearly   the   same   shape   and   texture   as   a   standard   narrow   neck   latex   bottle   nipple   making   the   use   of   an   occasional   bottle   easy   for   this   mostly   bf   baby .   there   is   a   hard   plastic   peice   inside   the   paci   used   to   keep   its   curved   shape   that   i   wish   wasn   t   there   because   if   you   accidentally   smash   the   paci   under   foot   or   some   other   way   it   will   break   and   poke   through   the   silicone   making   it   unusable .   otherwise   it   would   be   very   durable .   baby   now   has   eight   teeth   and   hasn   t   bit   through   a   paci   yet .
cool   product ,   but   not   perfect .   i   like   the   basic   format   of   this   machine .   it   s   battery   operated   and   portable ,   does   exactly   what   it   says ,   and   is   just   a   cool   thing   to   have   around   for   when   your   baby   drops   it   s   nuk .   the   only   problem   i   can   see   is   the   3   minute   wait   time   for   full   sterilization .   as   most   of   us   know   a   screaming   child   can   make   3   minutes   seem   like   an   eternity .   if   you   have   multiple   nuks   this   is   perfect .   but   i   never   carry   multiple   ones   so   theres   always   a   wait .   i   like   the   peace   of   mind   of   a   germ   free   pacifier ,   so   i   give   this   one   a   curly   special ,   nuk   nuk   nuk .   i   know ,   bad   joke ,   thanks   you   ladies   and   germs .
only   okay   i   love   the   concept   of   these !   the   problem   is ,   my   daughter   won   t   use   them .   the   entire   pacifier   is   rubbery   and   soft ,   and   she   won   t   use   it   as   a   pacifier .   she   doesn   t   really   like   playing   with   them   either   i   thought   maybe   it   would   work   as   a   sort   of   teether .   i   think   you   might   have   to   start   off   your   baby   with   these   type   of   pacifiers ,   because   i   think   switching   from   a   normal   style   to   these   won   t   work   well .
love   this !   i   bought   this   for   my   son   who   is   15   months   old   because   he   would   wake   up   every   night   at   3am   and   want   to   eat .   not   only   did   we   want   to   break   him   of   this   habit   and   get   him   to   learn   to   self   sooth   without   a   bottle   in   the   middle   of   the   night ,   we   didn   t   want   to   do   any   damage   to   his   teeth   with   milk .   we   tried   water   but   he   hated   that   too .   he   has   never   been   a   binky   kid   but   i   was   willing   to   try   anything   and   this   has   been   awesome .   he   puts   the   pacifier   in   his   mouth   and   then   he   holds   the   animal   the   way   that   he   would   normally   hold   a   bottle .   the   animal   is   so   soft   and   cuddly   too .   it   has   worked   great   for   us   and   he   really   seems   to   like   this .   i   highly   reccommend .
great   idea   but   built   a   little   too   flimsy   this   is   a   great   product   idea .   i   mean ,   how   many   times   does   the   little   one   drop   his   pacifier   all   the   time !   and   you   surely   don   t   want   to   have   to   wash   it   a   million   times   a   day   hoping   the   germs   get   off   that   way   ...   or   maybe   you   just   pick   up   the   pacifier   and   blow   it   off   then   hand   it   back ...   but ,   the   solution   to   this   is   the   pipila .   it   s   a   great   idea .   in   just   moments   the   pacifier   is   sterilized   and   ready   to   go   back   to   baby .   however ,   for   35   i   expect   something   a   little   more   sturdy   that   this   gizmo .   i   am   on   the   fence   as   whether   or   not   to   recommend   this   product   to   anyone   because   of   this   hence   the   three   stars .   if   it   were   built   stronger   i   would   definitely   give   it   more   stars   and   a   high   recommendation .
not   as   pictured   it   is   cute   but   definitively   much   smaller   and   cheaper   looking   than   the   one   on   the   picture .   about   half   the   size   i   would   say .   it   is   easier   to   find   the   pacifier   when   it   falls   and   i   think   eventually   my   baby   will   be   able   to   put   it   in   his   mouth ,   but   the   pacifier   does   not   detach   to   the   toy   so   you   can   not   change   the   pacifier   for   another   shape   or   to   sterilize   it .
i   should   have   read   the   reviews ....   omg !   why   was   it   dirty   i   couldn   t   believe   it   looked   so   funky !   and ,   it   really   didn   t   look   anything   like   the   picture .   very   disappointing .   it   s   not   even   worth   trying   to   return   it ... i   wish   i   could   give   no   stars !
best   idea   ever !   my   son   loves   his   mango   monkey   wubbanub .   the   original   we   have   had   for   15   months .   it   is   starting   to   get   worn   out .   the   pacifier   ripped   out   when   it   got   stuck   in   the   couch   a   few   months   back   which   was   totally   my   friend   s   fault ,   and   had   nothing   to   do   with   the   integrity   of   the   construction .   i   resewed   it   no   easy   feat   and   promptly   ordered   a   back   up .   my   son   still   prefers   the   original ,   but   was   excited   to   see   the   new   one .   it   washes   easily   in   the   washing   machine .   the   size   is   perfect   and   the   different   textures   and   colors   are   fun .   when   he   was   really   little   it   was   fun   to   watch   him   manipulate   the   monkey   to   get   the   pacifier   back   in   his   mouth .   he   was   able   to   do   that   at   about   4   months ,   so   no   more   looking   for   dropped   binkies   in   the   middle   of   the   night .
avent   animal   pacifers   i   was   happy   with   one   of   these   pacifers .   i   didnt   like   that   i   wasnt   able   to   specify   colors   or   prints   and   i   received   one   that   was   good   for   my   boy ,   and   the   other   was   for   a   girl ,   which   i   cant   use .
my   favorite   pacifier   what   i   love   most   is   that   this   pacifier   is   completely   rubber   no   hard   plastic   part   so   i   know   that   if   my   baby   accidentally   rolls   over   it   and   it   s   under   her   cheek   or   something ,   it   won   t   hurt   her   and   believe   me ,   she   has   slept   on   it   several   times   .   even   though   this   pacifier   doesn   t   have   a   little   ring   you   can   hold   on   to ,   you   can   stick   your   finger   inside   it   to   hold   onto   it .   this   is   the   one   that   hospitals   use ,   plus   they   re   easy   to   wash .   i   just   wish   it   came   in   more   colors !
works   better   for   us   than   other   ones   the   giraffe   works   very   well   for   us ,   our   baby   is   a   pacifier   pusher   outter   and   this   giraffe   wubbanub   when   put   upsidedown   seems   to   keep   it   in   pretty   well   in   fact   better   than   our   other   one   the   mango   monkey   asin   b0031w38yo   wubbanub   plush   pacifier   toy ,   mango   monkey   by   being   more   balanced .
great   but   giraffe   is   better   we   love   the   wubbanubs   but   have   found   that   the   giraffe   shaped   one   asin   b003ck3ldi   wubbanub   giraffe   works   better   at   keeping   the   pacifier   in .   the   two   are   differently   balanced   based   on   animal   shape   and   size   and   the   giraffe   does   a   better   job   of   keeping   the   pacifier   in   place .
not   what   i   expected   i   was   very   excited   to   get   this .   it   s   not   horrible   but   it   really   doesnt   do   what   i   hoped   it   would .   i   thought   this   would   help   the   pacifier   stay   put ,   but   the   stuffed   animal   is   really   really   light .   it   doesnt   stay   put   and   makes   it   easier   for   my   daughter   to   knock   it   out   of   her   mouth   on   accident .   i   also   wish   it   came   with   an   ortho   pacifier .
adorable !   my   son   loves   this !   it   helped   him   hold   the   pacifier   in   which   was   great ,   and   he   loved   holding   on   to   the   dog !   and   it   was   much   easier   to   find   when   it   dropped   on   the   ground   since   it   didn   t   roll   under   the   couch .   love   it !
my   baby   will   not   take   this   i   know   that   this   varies   from   baby   to   baby ,   but   my   4   month   old   will   not   take   this   pacifier ,   and   keeps   spitting   it   out ,   even   though   she   likes   other   pacifiers .
i   m   pleased   my   baby   loves   this   pacifier   and   i   m   pleased   that   she   does   it   really   comforts   and   soothes   her   so   no   fuss   for   her   and   no   headache   for   mommy .
good   for   teething   ! ! !   wubannubs   have   to   be   the   best   pacifier   by   far .   i   think   it   s   the   least   likely   to   mess   up   a   toddlers   teeth ! ! ! !
great   item   the   pacifier   box   really   worst   money , it   can   fill   2   pacifier ,   the   handle   u   can   put   on   the   stroller ,   car   seat   or   on   diaper   bags .   it   make   pacifier   clean
soothie   paci   s   great   product .   just   like   the   hospitals   use .   bought   pink   purple   for   girl   twin   and   green   for   boy   twin   so   i   can   keep   paci   s   separate !
follow   age   guidlines ! ! !   choking   hazard !   i   was   given   this   binky   at   the   hospital ,   didn   t   read   the   packaging   and   therefore   didn   t   know   that   this   was   only   for   babies   0   3   months .   my   6   month   old   put   the   whole   thing   in   his   mouth   and   thank   god   i   was   right   there   because   i   was   able   to   get   it   out   before   he   suffocated !   i   threw   it   away   immediately   and   want   to   warn   other   parents   about   the   dangers   of   giving   this   to   an   older   baby .
handy   little   pacifier   carrier   really   nice   little   carrier   keeps   pacifier   at   hand   easily   attaches   to   diaper   bag   strap   and   clean .   provides   a   way   to   keep   from   digging   at   the   bottom   of   the   diaper   bag   for   pacifier .   i   love   that   i   had   such   an   assortment   of   colors   to   choose   from .   there   s   a   color   pattern   for   everyone .
love   it !   not   only   is   it   so   flippin   cute   well ,   it   is   a   giraffe !   but   it   is   very   useful .   my   4   month   old   son   loves   to   hold   things   when   drifting   of   to   sleep ,   and   helps   to   keep   the   binky   in   his   mouth !   he   is   a   preemie   and   his   sucking   ability   isn   t   very   strong .   he   holds   on   to   it   quite   tightly !   only   bad   thing   is   you   can   t   replace   the   binky   if   damaged .
soothing   for   baby   this   bear   works   great   to   soothe   my   8   week   old   baby .   i   can   t   get   her   to   sleep   without   it .   only   problem   with   it   is   that   it   does   not   shut   off   after   40   minutes   like   they   said   it   would .   other   than   that ,   i   definitely   recommend   this   bear   for   anyone   with   a   baby   or   even   as   a   gift
cute   and   works   well   i   was   most   concerned   about   the   clip   the   round   edges   make   it   ok ,   and   it   holds   well .   however ,   the   clip   is   pretty   big ,   so   i   m   buying   another   type   with   the   small   metal   clip   next .   worth   a   try   if   you   don   t   like   the   bogginhead .
life   savers   my   sister   in   law   says   that   this   will   definitely   help   when   the   baby   is   born   if   he   takes   it .   she   is   so   excite   and   so   nervous   for   this   is   her   first   one .
worth   it !   we   love   using   these   pacifiers !   they   are   sturdy ,   easy   to   wash ,   and   bpa   free !   one   thing   i   really   like   about   phillips   avent   is   that   they   come   with   convenient   cover ,   which   is   excellent   when   you   are   putting   the   pacifier   in   your   bag   or   pocket   so   it   doesn   t   get   dirty .   and   the   biggest   plus   is   that   our   little   one   really   likes   to   use   it   and   it   makes   him   happy .
happy   baby   i   researched   what   was   the   best   pacifier   for   the   nursing   baby .   this   product   came   highly   recommended ,   i   agree .   this   was   the   only   pacifier   my   nursing   baby   would   take .   my   only   complaint   is   that   it   collects   dust   and   other   stuff   so   you   will   need   to   wipe   it   periodically .   the   tab   sticking   out   did   not   seem   to   bother   my   sleeping   baby .   she   loves   her   pacifier .
not   so   great   my   son   hated   these   from   the   start .   i   think   its   one   of   those   things   you   are   going   to   get   different   opinions   from   because   not   all   babies   like   the   same   things .
only   thing   my   preemie   would   take   my   baby   was   born   almost   4   weeks   early .   this   is   the   only   pacifer   she   would   take .   she   is   very   picky ...   my   husband   and   i   don   t   like   how   big   it   is   or   how   much   of   her   face   it   covers ....   but   its   what   she   likes .....   so   its   what   she   gets !
moo   moo   cow   wubbanub   this   little   cow   is   so   soft   and   floppy .   perfect   for   your   newborn .   my   grandson   has   a   few   of   the   different   designs   but   this   one   i   ordered   for   a   shower   gift   and   was   so   pleased   with   it   when   it   came .   the   underbelly   part   is   a   flowered   soft   cotton   waffled   material   that   you   find   in   recieving   blankets .   sweet .
best   pacifier   my   baby   girl   refused   all   pacifiers   until   this   one .   i   am   so   happy   i   bought   this .   she   doesn   t   care   too   much   for   pacifiers   anyhow   but   at   least   she   takes   this   one   every   now   and   then .   i   highly   recommend   these   to   all   parents .   they   seem   much   more   durable   than   your   standard   pacifier   too .   love   these !
2   pack   avent   pacifiers   these   are   the   best   kind   of   pacifiers   if   you   plan   to   breastfeed .   have   used   these   before   and   my   babies   seemed   to   like   them   the   best .
she   won   t   take   any   other   these   are   more   expensive   but   calming   our   little   one   makes   it   so   worth   it .   these   are   the   only   ones   she   doesn   t   spit   back   out .   i   also   like   that   it   doesn   t   imprint   on   her   face   like   the   plastic   ones   did .
cutest   thing   ever   i   got   this   to   late   we   switched   him   to   a   different   paci   waiting   for   this   to   come   in   mail   but   it   s   soo   soft   and   adorable
baby   loves   these ,   since   this   is   what   she   first   got   at   hospital   wasn   t   sure   i   could   get   these   anywhere ,   but   was   so   happy   to   see   them   online ,   since   the   one   that   she   got   when   she   was   born   was   almost   mia   yesterday   and   that   can   be   a   problem   with   an   infant .   so   stocked   up   on   these   and   love   the   different   colors .   only   downside   is   that   everything   gets   stuck   to   the   material   the   paci   is   made   of ,   so   constantly   washing   off   fuzzies   hair
hilarious !   a   must   have   for   a   fun   baby   shower !   can   t   say   that   the   babies   are   into   it ,   but   i   know   my   two   year   old   nephew   loves   to   walk   around   with   this   in   his   mouth   and   get   some   laughs !
great   product !   great   product ,   that   does   not   hide   the   baby   s   face .   i   do   not   have   anything   more   to   say   regarding   this   item .
good   buy   the   only   problem   i   had   with   buying   this   product   was   that   amazon   did   not   let   me   pick   my   colors .   as   a   result ,   my   son   ended   up   with   a   pink   pacifier .   but   the   product   itself   is   great .
poor   quality ! !   we   purchased   2   separate   wubbanubs   and   were   dissatisfied   with   both   of   them .   they   both   began   popping   seams   and   stuffing   coming   out   of   them   within   the   first   3   weeks .   out   child   was   3   weeks   old   and   obviously   not   harming   them   in   any   way ...   just   poor   poor   quality !   then   when   contacting   the   company   and   dealing   with   them   they   sent   another ...   which   has   zero   stuffing   in   it ...   they   asked   to   send   us   another   but   after   3   out   of   4   wubbanubs   being   broken   we   had   had   enough !
great   like   that   this   one   could   be   used   w   the   soothies   brand   pacifiers .   not   using   it   too   much   yet ,   because   don   t   want   anything   clipped   on   my   infant ,   as   it   kinda   gets   in   the   way   now ,   but   will   certainly   use   down   the   road   and   attaching   in   carseat   stroller .   just   wish   i   knew   what   design   i   was   getting   ahead   of   time .
not   impressed   with   quality   i   gave   this   3   stars   because   it   does   what   i   wanted   it   to   do ...   make   it   easy   for   my   3   month   old   to   hold   onto   her   soother .   however ,   the   re   stitching   on   this   was   poorly   done .   stuffing   was   poking   out   when   it   arrived   and   i   had   to   re   do   it .   i   guess   i   could   have   just   opened   up   a   stuffed   animal   i   already   had   and   sewn   a   soother   to   the   mouth   for   as   sloppy   as   this   looks .
for   pacifier   snobs   oui ,   s   il   vous   plait   my   beautiful   baby   girl   eschews   all   other   pacifier   brands   models   except   for   these   ones .   these   are   well   designed   with   an   indentation   for   you   to   hold   it   with   your   finger   and   your   baby   can   feel   your   finger   and   to   keep   it   in   their   mouth .   the   lip   of   the   pacifier   is   also   useful   for   parents   to   hold   the   pacifier   in   their   mouth   and   keep   their   two   hands   free .
myrtle   received   quickly .   loved   it ... a   gift   for   the   birth   of   my   first   grandbaby   and   all   were   pleased   and   amused   with   this   item !   a   hoot !
cute   but   not   super   safe   these   pacifiers   are   super   cute !   my   little   one   seemed   to   really   like   them !   so   much   she   has   been   sticking   the   entire   pacifier   in   her   mouth .   these   also   tend   not   to   stay   in   as . well   when   she   sleeps   at   night   compared   with   the   pacifiers   that   dont   have   a . handle   on   them .

avnet   soothie   pacifier   we   got   one   of   these   pacifiers   at   the   hospital   when   my   baby   was   born .   i   bought   others   after   we   came   home   but   he   really   liked   these   best .   i   recommend   them   for   any   baby .
my   baby   loves   her   wubbanub !   this   is   not   only   a   pacifier   but   a   wonderful   first   toy   for   an   infant .   my   baby   loves   this   toy   and   is   ahead   of   the   game   with   her   hand   coordination   because   of   it .   she   is   always   playing   with   it   and   enjoys   putting   it   in   and   out   of   her   mouth ,   improving   not   only   her   coordination   but   her   focus   as   well .   she   could   successfully   put   this   in   her   mouth   from   her   chest   at   just   over   2   months .   no   other   binkie   will   do ,   she   has   no   interest   in   them ,   we   have   3   and   she   loves   them   all .   easy   for   mom   to   find   in   a   jam   too !
hospital   style   pacifier ,   great   for   little   hands   and   they   never   get   lost ! !   i   first   bought   these   when   i   again   had   to   replace   the   12   pacifiers   that   had   gone   missing .   my   daughter   had   grown   accustom   to   the   feel   of   the   hospital   brand   pacifiers   since   she   spent   a   couple   of   months   there   after   birth .   i   came   across   these   and   bought   them   because   they   were   super   cute   but   was   unsure   if   my   daughter   would   like   them .   previously   i   had   bought   pacifiers   that   looked   like   the   ones   the   hospital   provided   but   were   not .   the   plastic   used   to   make   them   were   shiny   and   for   whatever   reason   my   daughter   had   no   interest   in   them .   i   later   discovered   that   the   gum   drop   pacifiers   were   identical   to   the   ones   provided   by   hospitals .   they   have   a   vast   variety   of   styles   and   colors   like   asin   b000zexkje   gumdrop   pacifier   full   term   natural   scent   orange   5   pack   and   asin   b007vsm3cm   gum   drop   preemie   pacifier   vanilla   scent   green   for   preemies .   these   wubbanubs   were   in   fact   made   of   the   same   material   and   perfect   for   my   little   one .   i   only   wished   i   had   found   them   sooner   since   my   other   two   children   are   grown .   i   could   have   saved   myself   from   trips   to   the   crib   in   the   middle   of   the   night   to   give   baby   back   her   pacifier .   these   pacifiers   are   perfect   for   little   hands   to   find   and   grab   in   the   middle   of   the   night .   my   daughter   just   puts   her   own   pacifier   back   in   her   mouth .   i   have   yet   to   lose   these   unlike   the   gazillion   other   pacifiers   i   have   purchased   over   the   years .   they   make   a   great   toy   for   baby   as   well .   while   the   pacifier   is   in   her   mouth   she   tends   to   play   with   the   plush   and   tag .   it   is   a   somewhat   meditative   motion   that   helps   to   sooth   her   and   or   occupy   her   in   her   carseat   stroller   crib .   so   not   only   is   it   a   pacifier   and   toy   but   it   helps   build   motor   skills .   there   are   a   number   of   different   colors ,   animals   and   even   textures   like   this   one   asin   b0031w38yo   wubbanub   plush   pacifier   toy ,   mango   monkey   .   the   tabby   kitten   is   my   favorite .   i   have   noticed   that   it   is   slightly   smaller   than   the   other   ones   i   ve   purchased   but   my   daughter   loves   it   just   the   same .   the   pacifier   itself   is   sewn   very   well   to   the   plush ,   however ,   i   usually   cut   the   pacifier   out   after   its   seen   some   wear .   just   as   a   caution .   once   you   stitch   the   the   hole   back   you   have   another   little   toy   for   baby   to   play   with   unlike   the   plain   pacifiers   that   you   have   to   dump .   they   make   great   gifts   and   additions   to   a   shower   basket .   i   have   bought   many   for   my   friends .   when   you   think   of   the   must   haves   in   baby   gear ,   i   personally   would   add   this   to   my   list .   br   br   update   to   wash   or   sterilize ,   i   place   a   small   plastic   sandwich   bag   around   the   plush   to   prevent   it   from   getting   wet .   i   can   then   wash   the   pacifier   with   warm   water   and   anti   bacterial   soap   or   clean   with   a   baby   safe   sterilizer .   then   i   just   take   a   sterile   wipe   or   even   a   baby   wipe   to   gently   rub   the   plush   doll .   it   has   worked   well   for   me   and   keeps   baby   s   gear   germ   free .
great   product   concearned   with   ashey   overcoat   after   some   use   my   daughter   loves   these ,   and   i   love   having   something   that   she   will   use .   the   only   thing   that   bothers   me   is   that   after   they   have   been   used   a   little ,   when   they   dry   they   begin   to   look   kind   of   white ,   almost   like   there   is   baby   powder   on   them .   i   do   not   know   if   this   is   normal ,   or   if   it   is   from   the   soap   i   use ,   but   after   they   look   that   way   i   throw   them   out .   they   are   great ,   i   just   wish   i   either   knew   why   this   was   happening ,   or   that   it   did   not   happen ,   so   that   they   would   last   longer .
poor   stitching   after   two   weeks   of   using   the   cutsie   caterpillar   wubbanub ,   the   area   where   it   is   stitched   into   the   face   of   the   caterpillar   has   almost   completely   come   undone .   my   baby   is   less   than   3   months   old ,   so   it   has   not   been   handled   roughly .   very   disappointed !   br   br   update   mary   meyer   sent   me   a   new   wubbanub ,   and   were   very   nice   about   the   issue .   they   said   they   had   addressed   the   stitching   error ,   and   it   shouldn   t   happen   again .   by   the   time   we   got   our   replacement ,   though ,   my   little   one   wouldn   t   take   a   pacifier   anymore ,   so   it   hasn   t   got   much   use !   changed   rating   from   one   star   to   two   for   good   customer   service .
fantastic   these   pacifiers   are   all   my   daughter   will   use .   we   came   home   from   the   hospital   with   a   green   one .   i   love   the   pink   and   purple   ones .   i   tried   giving   my   daughter   the   ones   for   3   months ,   but   she   prefers   the   newborn   ones ,   even   though   she   is   now   9   months .   she   can   put   them   in   herself ,   and   she   even   like   to   chew   on   the   back   of   them   for   teething .
great !   these   are   perfect   for   our   diaper   bag !   and   they   dont   bother   the   baby   at   all .   im   sure   you   moms   know   how   often   a   pacifier   gets   dropped ,   so   it   is   kind   of   neccesaary   while   out   and   abouy .
picture   is   deceiving   when   you   see   three   attachers   shown   you   think   that   is   what   you   are   getting .   i   was   disappointed   that   there   was   only   one   when   it   arrived .   not   such   a   great   deal   after   all .   br   the   clip   is   pretty   big   as   well .
my   baby   loves   them   girl   colors   a   plus ! !   these   are   the   same   binkies   that   the   hospital   gives   the   newborns .   needless   to   say   that   my   baby   took   well   to   them .   she   loves   them ! !
wubbanub   3   i   received   two   wubbanub   s   at   my   baby   shower .   my   son   i   both   loved   them .   so ,   as   a   gift   for   a   friends   baby   shower ,   i   ordered   the   caterpillar   from   amazon .   it   s   so   cute   for   a   baby   girl !   it   arrived   quicker   than   expected   was   exactly   what   i   wanted .
nice   product .   too   bad   it   didn   t   work   for   my   kid .   nice   product ,   a   good   quality   rubber .   too   bad   it   didn   t   work   for   my   kid ,   no   matter   how   long   i   ve   tried   to   make   him   suck   this   pacifier .   i   need   to   try   few   more   pacifiers ...
my   4   month   old   loves   it !   my   daughter   doesn   t   use   a   pacifier ,   but   this   is   great   for   her   to   nibble   on   while   she   s   having   trouble   falling   asleep .   she   loves   it   and   it   s   easy   for   her   to   keep   close .
love   these ! ! !   i   absolutely   love   these   pacifiers !   we   got   about   4   million   pacifiers   for   baby   showers   all   different   types   .   my   son   was   hospitalized   at   5   days   old ,   and   i   didn   t   have   time   to   pack   a   pacifier   for   him .   the   hospital   gave   us   one   of   these   and   i   really   don   t   know   what   we   would   have   done   without   it !   br   br   my   son   is   now   almost   8   months   and   we   have   used   these   pacis   the   whole   time .   they   wash   up   great   and   are   very   resilient !   i   love   the   bright ,   vivid   colors .   for   our   next   child ,   we   won   t   even   try   other   brands .
love   these   pacifiers !   we   have   a   couple   of   these   and   our   daughter   loves   them !   we   actually   snipped   the   pacifier   point   off   of   one   so   she   couldn   t   suck   on   it   but   could   still   hold   the   little   animal   for   comfort .   it   has   also   improved   her   hand   eye   coordination   because   she   has   to   hold   on   to   the   animal   to   get   the   pacifier   in   her   mouth .
seemed   nice   our   little   girl   didn   t   like   any   pacifier   we   gave   her .   this   all   around   feels   very   soft   and   the   shape   would   likely   work   quite   well   for   most   babies .   i   love   that   it   is   natural   and   agree   with   others   who   recommended   it .   thanks .
awesome   pacifier   but   quick   to   need   replacing   overall   i   am   extremely   pleased   with   these   pacifiers ,   and   will   continue   to   buy   them   despite   their   frequent   need   for   replacing   because   my   little   one   took   to   them   so   well .   br   br   i   was   able   to   introduce   this   paci   to   my   breastfeeding   newborn   in   week   3   with   no   nipple   confusion   just   be   careful   not   to   use   it   when   the   baby   is   hungry ,   only   use   it   for   comfort   when   you   know   he   does   not   need   to   nurse ,   and   not   too   often   until   after   week   6   8   .   he   really   seems   to   find   these   soft   and   pliable   pacifiers   to   be   very   comforting ,   and   i   like   that   they   were   designed   with   breastfeeding   babies   in   mind .   br   br   my   only   complaint   is   that   they   do   break   down   rather   quickly   and   need   to   be   replaced   about   every   4   6   weeks .   as   a   side   note   an   almost   comical   one   ,   if   you   have   a   kitty   be   careful ,   many   cats   love   the   smell   of   rubber   and   two   of   our   pacis   have   already   fallen   victim   to   our   cat .
funny   binki   got   this   for   my   2   year   old   daughter   who   loves   binkis ...   this   is   one   of   her   favorites .   she   has   about   twenty   of   them   and   she   carries   them   around   in   a   small   tray .   she   enjoys   making   people   laugh   with   this   particular   binki .
pacifier   the   pacifier   arrived   quickly   and   as   described .   it   is   really   cute   and   very   fitting   for   my   first   granddaughter   due   to   be   born   very   soon
liked   the   idea ,   but   not   the   execution ...   i   loved   the   idea   of   a   natural   rubber   pacifier ,   since   i   want   to   expose   baby   to   as   few   toxic   substances   as   possible .   i   bought   these ,   as   well   as   some   asin   b003o1ia1s   bornfree   coolflow   pacifiers   2   pk   ,   which   are   bpa   and   phalate   free .   baby   did   not   seem   to   have   a   preference   as   far   as   nipple   shape   on   the   pacifiers ,   but   disliked   when   the   rounded   part   of   the   pacifier   would   smash   his   nose .   i   was   concerned   about   it   when   he   slept ,   because   it   blocked   his   nose   airways   and   seemed   like   it   made   him   uncomfortable .   ultimately ,   the   idea   was   better   than   the   execution   of   the   product ,   and   we   now   exclusively   use   the   born   free   pacifiers .
super   cute   my   little   boy   loves   these .   we   have   been   using   the   duck   since   he   was   born .   i   got   this   one   to   keep   one   at   my   mom   s   house .   he   loves   to   hold   them   and   it   s   easy   for   them   to   put   back   in   their   mouth .
good   product   but   it   didn   t   work   my   grandson   won   t   take   a   pacifier   no   matter   how   many   different   kinds   we   ve   tried .   br   but   this   product   is   great .   just   as   promised   and   lightning   fast   delivery .   it   s   not   their   fault   the   kid   won   t   take   it ,   lol !
absolutely   adorable ! ! !   this   is   the   cutest   little   pacifiers   ever ! ! !   if   you   a   fan   of   monkeys ,   this   is   a   must   have !   my   new   little   grandson   is   going   to   love   it .
so   cute ! !   my   daughter   is   obsessed   w   her   wubbanubs   yes ,   we   have   6   of   them   .   this   one   is   so   cute   and   totally   girly .   it   washes   very   nicely   too .   a   couple   others   we   have   are   covered   in   lint   after   washing   and   this   one   isn   t .   worth   the   price !
a   baby   bag   staple !   how   many   times   are   you   out   with   your   baby   and   plonk !   there   goes   the   pacifier   on   the   floor !   many   times   a   bathroom   or   sink   is   just   not   convenient .   make   your   life   easier   and   have   these   handy   wipes   on   hand .   they   are   food   grade   and   safe .   i   wipe   the   pacifier   down   in   a   few   seconds ... no   need   to   look   for   a   sink   and   you   can   even   use   it   for   light   jobs   like   wiping   the   baby   s   nose   or   face .
not   my   favorite   wubbanub   we   have   several   wubbanubs ,   can   t   imagine   br   being   without   them ,   but   the   lion   is   not   br   our   favorite .   our   first   one   had   a   defect   br   where   the   mane   started   to   come   away   from   br   the   body ,   missed   stitching   or   something .   br   wubbanub   sent   a   prompt   replacement ,   but   br   i   m   still   not   impressed   with   the   lion .   br   the   material   used   on   the   mane   and   the   br   end   of   the   tail   looks   frayed   and   worn   br   looking   after   only   a   short   period   of   use .   br   wubbanubs   yes !   their   lion   no .
best   binky   bear   ever   it   is   great .   can   t   live   without   it .   you   can   only   appreciate   this   if   you   have   a   child   that   loses   his   binky   in   the   middle   of   the   nite .... easy   to   locate ... happy ,   quiet   child  
great   to   calm   a   fussy   baby   my   grandson   loves   his   dino   pacifier .   he   is   2   months   old   and   is   calmed   by   the   pacifier   and   likes   to   hold   the   soft   dinosaur .
happy   so   far   we   have   been   very   happy   with   this   changing   pad   so   far .   it   fit   perfect   on   the   top   of   our   baby   dresser .   we   keep   it   covered   all   the   time .   i   would   highly   recommend   getting   the   longer   one   just   because   our   son   is   almost   6   months   old   and   i   can   t   see   this   lasting   us   longer   than   a   couple   more   months   due   to   his   length !   we   bought   the   asin   b002ud65x6   carters   super   soft   dot   changing   pad   cover ,   chocolate   which   fits   perfectly .
great   product   my   baby   had   gas   constipation   because   of   a   tongue   tie   issue .   this   was   great   to   give   him   some   gripe   water .   he   took   it   at   3   weeks   old   without   any   issues ,   even   though   he   is   breastfed .   it   is   easy   to   assemble   and   easy   to   clean .   will   be   nice   to   have   as   he   gets   older .
cute ,   but   14   month   old   doesnt   play   with   it   yet   very   cute   and   fun   to   look   at   but   my   baby   doesnt   play   with   it   yet .   i   m   sure   she   will   once   she   is   closer   to   1.5   years   of   age .   br   br   suction   cup   has   a   really   good   hold   br   br   happy   overall
teethifier   vs .   zoli   stick   gum   massager   for   first   molars   i   purchased   the   teethifier   along   with   the   zoli   stick   gum   massagers   for   my   15   month   old ,   who   is   cutting   his   first   set   of   molars .   he   never   used   a   pacifier ,   so   i   wasn   t   sure   how   this   would   work   for   us .   honestly ,   he   doesn   t   use   either   of   the   back   teeth   teethers   much ,   but   before   bed   he   ll   chew   on   the   teethifier   while   we   read   books ,   and   i   leave   it   with   him   in   his   crib .   sometimes   i   find   him   chewing   on   it   in   the   morning .   it   does   make   him   drool   a   ton .   he   has   not   used   the   zoli   stick   teethers   more   than   a   handful   of   times ,   and   most   of   the   time   he   turns   it   around   and   chews   on   the   non   rubbery   end .   all   in   all ,   if   your   little   one   s   molars   seem   to   be   bothersome ,   i   would   recommend   the   teethifier .
had   to   return   them   because   they   run   too   small   way   small   but   super   well   made .   love   theaterial   but   can   t   saying   more   about   it   since   couldn   t   even   use   them   cause   they   were   sooo   tiny .   and   cute
works   for   moses   baskets   i   purchased   this   item   for   my   baby   s   moses   basket .   the   sheets   designed   to   fit   a   moses   basket   were   not   large   enough   for   the   style   we   own ,   so   based   on   the   dimensions   given   for   the   bassinet   sheet ,   i   thought   i   d   take   a   chance .   the   sheet   is   a   bit   big ,   but   because   it   is   the   tshirt   cotton   knit   material ,   it   shrinks   a   little   in   the   dryer .   it   is   also   elastic   all   the   way   around ,   so   it   tucks   underneath   easily   to   fit   the   basket   pad .   it   would   also   stretch   well   to   fit   a   larger   mattress .   i   am   very   pleased   with   the   sheet .   it   washes   well ,   and   would   probably   fit   a   variety   of   baskets   and   bassinets .   br   the   white   is   a   bright   white ,   the   pink   is   a   pale   pastel ,   and   the   sage   is   more   of   a   dull   celery   color   very   pretty   with   our   pink   bedding !   .
good   product   for   the   price   paid   i   am   quite   satisfied   with   this   car   seat .   easy   to   install ,   easy   to   use ,   the   colors   are   pleasant .   i   am   using   this   seat   forward   facing .   my   daughter   loves   it ,   and   so   do   i .   i   would   recommend   this   seat   to   a   friend .
great   great   product !   moving   into   a   house   with   carpet   in   the   dining   room   our   son   is   a   spiller   thrower ,   so   this   will   keep   the   carpet   clean   while   looking   nice .   heavy   enough   to   stay   put ,   light   enough   to   travel   if   needed .
my   son   s   favorite   lovie   my   son   loves   his   frog !   i   think   almost   every   child   has   a   comfort   toy   and   this   is   his .   i   put   it   through   the   washer   and   dryer   just   about   every   week   and   so   far   8   months   later   it   s   holding   up   just   fine .
very   pleased !   this   is   an   amazing   product ! !   exactly   what   we   expected ! !   so   glad   we   decided   to   order   it   through   amazon   as   we   were   told   through   all   local   businesses   that   it   wasn   t   available   because   it   was   on   back   order   from   the   company !
great   product   we   bought   these   for   our   son   once   he   was   about   3   months   old   and   switched   him   over   from   the   asin   b0045i6iao   philips   2   pack   avent   soothie   pacifier ,   green ,   0   3   months   .   it   took   him   a   little   while   to   get   accustomed   to   them   but   accepted   them   pretty   much   right   away ,   so   we   never   had   to   test   out   any   other   pacifiers .   i   highly   recommend   buying   a   couple   of   packs   of   these   since   they   always   seem   to   disappear !   make   sure   to   get   a   asin   b004323nhs   booginhead   pacigrip   pacifier   holder ,   delicate   dot   green   to   attach   to   it ! !
breast   fed   baby   likes   it !   i   never   used   a   pacifier   for   my   daughters ,   but   since   i   can   t   get   in   the   back   to   comfort   my   son   on   car   trips   i   decided   to   introduce   a   pacifier .   he   wasn   t   thrilled   with   the   ones   commonly   sold   in   stores ,   so   i   did   a   little   research   and   found   that   breast   fed   babies   tend   to   accept   this   one ,   with   the   vanilla   scent .   br   br   it   being   clear ,   it   s   kind   of   fun   to   watch   his   little   mouth   sucking   on   this .
solved   our   problems   with   breakouts !   my   son   has   had   some   sort   of   break   out   or   allergic   reaction   to   regular   pacifiers   since   he   was   around   3   months   old .   i   have   tried   everything   you   could   possibly   think   of   to   clear   it   up .   medications ,   creams ,   pacifiers   with   more   vents ,   all   different   brands ,   latex ,   silicone ,   and   even   tried   breaking   him   of   using   a   pacifier   all   together .   he   would   have   red   bumps   on   the   area   around   his   mouth   that   would   sometimes   form   blisters ,   crack ,   and   bleed .   at   6   months   old   i   finally   bought   these   pacifiers   as   my   last   resort   and   since   using   them   we   have   not   had   any   breakouts   at   all ! !   br   it   has   been   wonderful   for   my   son   and   me .
made   my   daughter   choke !   don   t   waste   your   money   or   put   your   childs   life   in   danger ! ! ! ! ! !   as   soon   as   i   put   this   in   my   daughters   mouth   she   began   to   choke .   i   turned   her   over   and   had   to   pat   her   back   and   watch   her   choke .   she   was   gasping   for   air   as   i   was   screaming   and   crying .   why   would   they   make   this   product   for   infants ! ! !   she   coughed   her   medicine   up   with   her   foamy   saliva .   i   was   so   terrified .   she   started   to   turn   red   and   i   just   cradled   her   in   my   arms   when   she   began   breathing   again .   if   i   could   give   this   product   zero   stars   i   would ! !   do   not   waste   your   money   or   put   your   child   s   life   in   danger ! !
lost   its   glow   after   we   sterilized   it !   we   were   thrilled   to   find   this   product   and   see   how   it   worked ...   until   we   sterilized   it !   br   it   lost   its   glow   after   that   and   became   a   regular   pacifier .
does   not   disappoint   this   is   the   second   wubba   nub   i   bought   for   my   daughter .   i   got   her   first   one   as   a   shower   gift .   she   has   the   lamb ,   monkey   pink   elephant .   she   is   almost   6   months   this   was   the   last   one   i   got   for   her   at   5   months .   she   loves   it   and   never   really   took   a   pacifier   until   these .   she   loves   to   put   the   animal   in   her   mouth   too   she   chews   on   it .   many   people   think   they   re   a   pain   because   you   can   t   clean   them   but   i   throw   them   in   the   washing   machine   all   the   time   with   her   laundry .   i   don   t   put   it   in   the   dryer ... i   just   let   it   air   dry .
wubbanub   giraffe   fantastic ! so   much   better   than   snapping   it   on   to   their   clothing ! they   have   the   pacifier , as   well   as , a   toy ! ! i   would   recommend   this   for   any   new   mother   or   grandmother !
sucker   i   love   these   pacifiers   it   would   have   been   better   if   there   were   options   for   color   choices   because   i   got   two   pink   ones   out   of   the   3   packages   that   i   ordered   and   i   have   a   boy
love   love   love   love   it !   my   daughter   loves   this   wubbanub !   it   causes   her   to   suck   a   bit   louder   than   her   usual   pacifier ,   but   i   think   that   s   because   this   one   is   flat   instead   of   curved   inward   toward   her   face   which ,   btw ,   i   like   better   b   c   she   doesn   t   get   slober   face   or   binky   indentations   on   her   cheeks !   .   the   stitching   on   the   caterpillar   body   looks   like   i   may   end   up   mending   it   in   the   future ,   which   is   why   i   gave   it   4   stars   instead   of   5 .
nice   my   3   month   old   baby   girl   simply   just   love   them ,   ever   since   she   got   these   she   kept   on   playing   with   them   in   and   out   of   her   mouth   constantly .
perfect   pacifier   this   is   the   only   pacifier   my   daughter   will   take .   it   has   give   in   it   unlike   other   pacifiers   so   it   s   more   natural .
wubbanub   i   am   very   happy   with   my   monkey   wubbanub .   it   is   small   enough   to   be   comfortable   for   an   infant .   i   think   it   is   so   cute ,   hopefully   the   baby   enjoys   it !
cheaper   isn   t   always   better   i   bought   this   product   based   on   a   previous   product   we   had   for   our   first   child .   the   pacimal   s   brand   is   much   better   as   the   stuffed   animal   is   better   quality   and   most   importantly   the   pacifier   can   be   replaced ,   or   taken   out   and   sterilized .   br   br   this   product   does   not   allow   you   to   remove   the   pacifier .   i   will   not   be   purchasing   another   one .   i   will   keep   this   one   for   now ,   but   will   definitely   be   purchasing   another   pacimal .   br   br   also ,   as   someone   else   posted   before   me ,   the   giraffe   s   neck   is   flimsy .   woops .   didn   t   think   of   that   when   i   was   making   my   purchase .
best   pacifier   ever !   my   kiddo   loves   this !   great   for   when   babies   are   small .   the   nipples   are   shaped   perfect   for   babies   mouths   and   the   animal   makes   it   easy   to   hold   and   recognize .   i   always   buy   these   for   baby   gifts   and   all   the   mothers   rave   about   it   and   ask   where   they   can   get   more .   i   have   2   of   the   same   so   i   can   change   them   out   to   wash .
they   sent   me   the   wrong   product   be   careful   when   you   order   the   newborn   pacifiers   by   soothie   from   parents   favorite   on   amazon   market .   i   paid   for   and   ordered   the   soothie   brand .   instead ,   they   sent   me   the   avent   soothie   pacifier .   i   could   have   purchased   these   at   walmart   and   not   paid   for   shipping !
best   thing   ever .   someone   gave   us   one   of   these   as   a   gift   and   we   thought   it   was   funny   until   we   started   using   it ,   now   we   can   t   live   without   it .   our   favorite   part   about   this   pacifier   is   finding   it   in   the   bed   at   night .   it   is   much   easier   to   search   for   this   than   anything   else .   my   daughter   through   the   first   one   out   of   the   car   and   we   lost   it .   we   only   made   it   one   night   without   it   before   we   found   this   one   online   and   ordered   it .   my   only   regret   is   not   ordering   2   just   in   case .
great   gift   i   gave   this   wubbanub   as   a   small   shower   gift   that   i   hosted   for   a   dear   friend .   it   was   a   small   gathering   for   her   3rd   baby   boy   and   while   the   gift   itself   wasn   t   huge ,   she   loved   it !
mute   button   fun !   i   bought   this   for   my   granddaughter   and   she   loves   it !   but   the   best   part   it   is   so   much   fun !   people   love   to   respond   when   they   see   it !   very   happy   with   this   purchase !
nice ,   but   not   enticing   these   are   really   nice ,   but   my   daughter   did   not   take   to   them .   they   seemed   a   bit   bulky   in   her   mouth .   hopefully   we   can   save   them   for   when   she   is   a   little   older   and   see   if   she   likes   them   then .
love   the   wubbanub   i   had   purchased   one   of   these   for   each   of   my   previous   children   so   i   thought   i   would   buy   one   for   my   newest   addition .   once   again   i   was   not   disappointed .   my   son   loves   it   and   it   goes   everywhere   with   us .   it   has   helped   my   son   sleep   in   his   crib   over   night ,   it   gives   him   something   to   cuddle   with .   in   short   i   love   it !
great   pacifierss   i   ordered   these   because   they   are   the   pacifiers   they   give   the   babies   in   the   hospital .   they   arrived   on   time   and   i   am   pleased   with   the   product .
perfect   size   after   the   birth   of   my   daughter ,   the   hospital   gave   her   this   brand   of   pacifier .   she   loved   it   and   mam   was   the   only   kind   she   would   use !   i   believe   she   liked   the   size   of   it   along   w   how   light   weight   it   was .   i   never   worried   about   it   covering   her   nose   or   obstructing   her   air   way   in   any   way .   i   loved   the   carrying   case   they   came   in   too ! !
for   newborns !   avent   is   a   great   brand   and   there   products   are   always   5   stars .   br   these   pair   of   pacifiers   are   really   good   material   and   excelent   choice   for   newborn   babies .
our   new   favorite   paci   my   son   was   given   a   gumdrop   paci   at   our   local   children   s   hospital   after   undergoing   surgery .   he   took   to   it   immediately   and   seemed   very   calmed   by   the   vanilla   scent .   after   using   it   for   a   week   in   the   hospital ,   he   no   longer   cares   for   his   other   pacis .   the   pacifier   is   very   soft   and   fits   to   his   face   without   leaving   marks .   it   is   one   piece   construction   and   does   not   get   filled   with   soap   or   water   when   washed .   my   only   wish   is   that   the   vanilla   scent   came   in   multiple   colors .
best   pacifier   ever !   this   pacifier   is   awesome   because   you   can   see   the   little   mouths   at   work   when   you   look   into   the   hole .   my   daughter   also   loved   to   stick   her   finger   in   the   hole   and   chew   on   the   sides   when   she   was   teething .   probably   the   best   teething   toy   she   has !   the   wubbanubs   pacifier   attached   to   a   small   stuffed   animal   are   also   adorable   and   really   work   with   the   baby   s   gasping   reflex !   highly   recommend ! !
new   mo   mom   this   is   by   far   the   most   genius   pacifier   i   have   ever   seen .   we   are   ebfing   and   didn   t   allow   a   pacifier   until   a   solid   2   3   weeks   after   nursing   was   well   established .   no   confusion .   also ,   this   pacifier   doesn   t   go   flying   across   the   room   when   our   daughter   spits   it   out .   it   just   falls   to   right   underneath   her   mouth .   as   a   newborn ,   9   out   of   10   times   she   was   able   to   get   it   back   in   her   mouth   by   herself .   also ,   because   there   is   a   stuffed   animal   attached   to   it ,   we   never   lose   this   pacifier !   a   great   investment ,   as   we   ve   easily   lost   probably   6   other   green   little   pacifiers   because   they   aren   t   attached   to   something   bigger .   lastly ,   it   s   very   cute   watching   our   daughter   hold   her   little   wubby   friend ,   now   that   she   s   getting   older   and   gaining   better   use   of   her   hands .
so   cute   i   ordered   this   wubba   for   my   youngest   son   and   he   loves   it !   he   loves   all   his   wubbanubs   but   this   one   is   the   cutest  
the   best !   my   son   is   a   natursutten   pacifier   junkie ,   and   i   just   ordered   the   new   butterfly   style ,   and   he   loves   them   as   much   as   the   original !   br   br   these   also   double   as   a   fabulous   teether .   the   texture   and   the   density   are   perfect   for   soothing   sore   gums .
hole   is   too   big   i   expected   this   to   be   more   like   a   bottle   nipple   where   the   baby   would   suck   the   medicine   out ...   instead   it   just   lets   the   medicine   drain   freely   into   her   mouth .   it   didn   t   work   for   us   unfortunately .
super   cute   and   helpful   to   keep   in   place   our   baby   boy   used   this   and   it   helped   to   keep   the   binky   in   place ,   he   would   hold   the   doggy   like   hugging   it   while   the   binky   stayed   in   his   mouth .   we   got   lots   of   compliments   as   to   how   cute   he   looked   with   that   binky .   i   wish   he   liked   pacifiers   past   4   months   so   i   could   buy   more   of   these ,   the   are   super   cute   and   durable ... good   quality !
good   quality   great   price   i   purchased   this   mesh   gate   for   my   5   mo   old   puppy .   it   has   a   good   quality   and   i   got   it   for   a   great   price .   also ,   i   don   t   have   to   worry   about   my   puppy   getting   his   tiny   head   stuck   in   the   gate   because   its   a   mesh   gate   not   straight   bars .   its   safe   and   it   does   the   job .
not   recommended   too   hard   and   don   t   fit   together   well   my   daughter   got   these   as   a   gift .   she   loves   bath   toys   and   i   hate   the   mildew   her   other   squirting   toys   accumulate ,   so   i   thought   these   would   be   great ,   but   i   was   disappointed .   the   toys   are   much   too   hard   for   a   baby   toddler   to   squirt   and   don   t   squirt   well   even   when   i   push   them   when   you   squeeze   them ,   water   and   air   comes   out   of   the   middle   where   the   parts   meet   .   after   a   few   tries ,   i   put   them   away .
too   cute ! !   the   little   masks   are   so   cute .   i   was   so   impressed   with   the   quality .   even   the   back   of   the   mask   is   very   well   made   and   nicely   finished .   the   elastic   part   is   covered   in   fabric   and   feels   comfortable   to   wear .   you   will   not   be   disappointed   with   this   purchase .   br   i   m   not   sure   if   it   s   obvious   in   the   description   but   these   masks   are   for   children ,   probably   suitable   for   18   months   6   years .   it   will   fit   on   an   adult   s   head   because   the   elastic   is   very   stretchy   but   the   nose   doesn   t   fall   in   the   right   place   and   it   will   look   funny .   this   is   a   small   thing   but   the   eye   opening   placement   is   a   little   awkward ,   they   seem   a   little   too   far   apart .   my   son   can   still   see   through   it   but   the   spacing   is   strange ,   even   for   an   adult .
effective   these   are   very   useful   for   storing   baby   food   in   small   quantities .   it   s   easy   to   get   the   food   out   one   at   a   time   or   all   at   once   and   then   you   can   store   them   in   a   freezer   bag .
terrible   safety   for   the   headrest   we   ordered   this   booster   and   delivery   was   flawless ,   as   usual   with   amazon .   however ,   upon   opening   the   product ,   i   already   felt   the   poor   construction .   i   put   both   halves   together ,   and   could   move   it   several   inches   front   to   back   while   locked   .   the   manual   stated   that   a   little   play   was   normal   ,   and   i   could   have   lived   with   that .   i   couldn   t   get   it   to   snap   into   the   second   position .   that   again   i   could   have   lived   with .   the   major   flaw ,   however ,   was   that   the   headrest   adjustment   does   not   stay   up .   any   movement   will   bring   it   down .   video   reviews   only   show   people   moving   it   up   and   down   with   one   hand .   when   my   daughter   got   in   the   car   seat ,   down   went   the   head   rest .   readjusted ,   and   when   she   got   out ,   same   thing   happened .   not   only   is   it   inconvenient ,   it   is   just   unsafe .   if   the   headrest   was   down   or   went   down   in   an   accident ,   it   could   really   injure   the   neck   of   the   child   my   daughter   is   6 ,   52   inches   with   a   long   torso .   when   the   headrest   comes   down   it   really   hits   her   shoulder   neck   area   .   what   a   shame ,   as   we   had   a   wonderful   car   seat   asin   b004ebux80   safety   1st   complete   air   65   protect   convertible   car   seat ,   silver   leaf   that   actually   protected   our   son   during   a   major   crash .   the   van   was   t   boned ,   flipped   and   dragged ,   our   son   didn   t   cry   even   once .   the   air   feature   really   works ,   but   it   makes   no   sense   to   put   a   good   feature   on   a   terrible   product .   it   is   going   back   to   amazon   this   week .
don   t   by   it !   before   buying   this   product   i   ve   read   the   reviews .   br   i   ve   read   several   which   suggested   serious   manufacture   problems   but   thought   to   myself   amazon   wouldn   t   sell   it   if   it   doesn   t   work ...   and   it   will   probably   won   t   happen   to   me   .   br   well   i   was   wrong   i   got   the   two   parental   units   version ,   and   both   do   not   charge .   i   ve   tried   switching   outlets ,   chargers ,   shaking   it   and   praying ,   but   it   just   wouldn   t   charge .   br   br   don   t   make   my   mistake   go   with   a   higher   rated   product ,   even   if   it   costs   you   a   few   bucks   more .   br   otherwise ,   it   will   cost   you   a   definite   50   bucks   more ! !
soft   and   safe   but   check   the   dimensions   i   was   startled   when   i   pulled   this   out   of   the   box   because   it   was   so   much   bigger   than   i   thought   it   would   be .   i   saw   the   pictures   other   people   posted   of   their   babies   using   this   in   the   sink ,   and   figured   i   could   do   the   same .   i   was   completely   wrong   it   s   way   too   big   for   that .   i   guess   some   people   have   really   huge   sinks !   so   i   was   initially   disappointed   that   i   had   to   use   this   in   the   tub   with   a   2   wk   old   baby   but   i   loved   it   almost   as   soon   as   i   tried   it .   it   s   soft   with   plenty   of   cushioning   so   she   s   relaxed   and   comfortable .   the   material   holds   in   water   and   stays   warm .   the   head   is   slightly   angled   upward   so   it   s   harder   for   the   standing   water   to   get   into   her   ears .   it   s   easy   to   squeeze   out   and   hang   up   to   dry   on   the   shower   rod   though   it   takes   until   the   next   day   to   get   completely   dry   .   i   haven   t   had   any   issues   with   it   getting   smelly ,   after   4   months   of   twice   a   week   use .   but   the   directions   on   the   tag   clearly   tell   you   how   to   wash   it ,   if   it   does   start   to   smell .   now   that   my   daughter   s   bigger   and   her   feet   reach   past   the   bottom ,   she   loves   kicking   her   feet   in   the   water .   i   think   i   m   going   to   start   gifting   these   to   pregnant   friends .
cute ,   needs   improvements   i   saw   this   online   and   thought   it   would   be   a   really   neat   toy   since   it   transitions .   i   do   like   it ,   but   like   other   reviews   i   ve   read   the   mat   is   poorly   made   and   the   hanging   toys   aren   t   very   intertaining .   all   of   the   toys   do   something   except   for   the   lion .   the   elephant   has   a   ball   that   rolls ,   the   bird   has   beads   in   it ,   and   the   frog   has   rings   hanging   down .   but   all   the   toys   except   for   the   mirror   can   be   removed   and   changed   out .   the   mat   easily   bunches   up   under   baby   and   doesn   t   stay   in   place   well .   i   do   like   that   when   baby   is   older   the   piano   changes   to   a   sitting   toy .   hopefully   we   ll   get   more   use   out   of   it   then .   she   does   like   to   kick   the   piano   and   the   lights   on   the   piano .   our   baby   was   6mths   when   this   purchased   and   it   doesn   t   really   entertain   her   as   well   as   we   had   hoped .   but   i   got   it   on   sale   at   babys   r   us   for   less   than   the   amazon   price   was   on   sale ,   usually   more   expensive   there   ,   so   for   a   toy   for   less   than   fourty   bucks   i   recommend   it .
what   a   pretty   toddler   bed   i   purchased   the   davinci   elizabeth   ii   toddler   bed   in   natural   color   about   6   months   ago ,   but   i   paid   only   150 .   br   br   pros   br   sturdy   structure ,   does   not   wobble   br   looks   very   pretty   br   assembly   was   fast ,   easy   br   daughter   loves   it ,   was   very   proud   to   be   sleeping   in   a   big   girl   bed   and   gave   up   her   crib   happily   br   the   mattress   from   her   standard   crib   fits   in   this   bed   just   fine   br   i   m   about   to   buy   the   conversion   kit   my   daughter   grows   like   a   weed !   plus ,   we   moved   her   out   of   crib   kind   of   late   and   will   get   more   use   out   of   it   br   br   con   br   soft   wood   means   scratches   and   dents .   it   arrived   in   perfect   condition ,   but   we   put   some   marks   in   during   assembly ,   then   my   toddler   added   a   few   later ...   not   too   important   to   me ,   gave   up   on   having   anything   flawless   with   kids   br   br   what   helped   me   decide   to   buy   this   bed   other   than   its   price   and   looks   was   that   you   can   use   both   panels   on   the   front ,   so   even   my   always   wiggling   child   won   t   roll   out   of   it ,   and   even   her   anxious   father   finds   it   safe   enough .   at   the   same   time ,   she   can   easily   climb   out   in   the   morning .
flimsy ,   poor   quality ,   lowsy   instructions   this   product   appeared   to   be   a   kit   to   make   a   nice ,   hard   plaster   ornament   or   keepsake ,   but   the   end   result   is   actually   a   bendable ,   cheap   looking   mold .   that   is ,   if   you   re   successful   in   completing   the   project .   br   the   good   news   is   it   works   for   capturing   the   precious   handprint   or   footprint   of   your   little   one   while   he   she   is   still   so   little .   and   the   kit   came   with   enough   putty   for   me   to   make   a   mold   of   my   daughter   s   newborn   handprint   and   footprint   and   even   a   footprint   mold   for   our   yorkie .   br   unfortunately ,   the   kit   as   a   whole   is   pathetic .   the   strip   of   plastic   to   be   used   as   a   cookie   cutter   for   the   putty   is   very   difficult   to   get   into   a   decent   circle   or   oval ,   and   the   putty   is   so   sticky   that   if   you   get   a   good   shape ,   you   probably   can   t   keep   it .   in   addition ,   the   little   wooden   roller   used   to   flatten   the   surface   of   the   putty   only   sticks   to   it   and   pulls   it   up   from   the   work   surface .   i   ended   up   using   an   empty   plastic   pill   bottle   which   worked   much   much   better .   as   if   that   s   not   enough ,   the   instructions   start   off   talking   about   using   a   hand   for   the   impression ,   but   by   the   end   of   it ,   they   re   talking   about   a   foot !   br   still   easy   enough   to   follow ...   but   if   you   re   going   to   sell   a   product ,   you   should   at   the   very   least   proofread   the   instructions ,   and   maybe   practice   it   yourself   once ,   just   to   see   if   it   works   with   the   tools   provided .   in   my   experience ,   it   didn   t .   br   as   huge   as   the   baby   product   industry   is ,   there   s   got   to   be   a   better   product   out   there   than   this .
amazing   our   baby   was   born   with   some   breathing   issues .   they   are   mild ,   but   sent   my   first   time   mom   mind   into   a   tailspin !   this   monitor   works   wonderful !   it   is   so   nice   to   be   able   to   roll   over   at   night   and   flip   on   the   monitor   and   see   her   as   opposed   to   having   to   go   into   the   other   room   and   wake   her   up   to   check   on   her .   and   knowing   that   the   alarm   would   sound   if   no   movement   was   detected .   the   only   issues   we   have   had   have   been   our   own   fault   ex .   forgetting   to   pause   the   monitor   when   lifting   the   baby   out   of   the   crib   but   once   the   learning   curve   was   over ,   it   was   fantastic !   i   m   so   glad   we   have   this   for   our   first   baby   and   thrilled   to   be   able   to   use   it   with   our   next   child   whenever   that   day   may   come !
love   the   joovy   room2   play   yard   this   play   yard   was   even   nicer   than   i   expected .   you   can   see   the   4   legs   for   support ,   but   there   is   also   more   built   in   support   underneath .   the   construction   is   heavy   duty   yet   not   heavy .   setup   takes   less   than   a   minute   and   there   is   lots   of   play   room .   you   could   easily   put   more   than   one   child   in   the   play   yard   and   still   have   plenty   of   room   for   toys .   it   also   comes   with   a   nice   soft   cotton   blend   sheet .   this   play   yard   is   the   best   quality   i   have   seen   and   i   am   very   pleased .
great   pump   made   for   the   occasional   pumper   i   m   a   full   time   mom ,   so   i   only   needed   a   pump   for   occasional   use ,   to   build   up   a   little   stock   in   the   freezer   or   for   the   odd   day   when   i   was   going   to   be   away   from   the   baby .   this   pump   is   perfect   for   that .   it   s   plenty   powerful   the   variable   suction   strength   more   than   exceeds   what   i   need   to   pump   as   efficiently   as   possible .   i   usually   use   it   plugged   into   an   outlet ,   but   i   ve   had   to   run   it   on   the   batteries   probably   a   dozen   times   so   far   and   i   m   still   on   the   original   set   of   batteries .   it   s   compact   and   comes   with   a   carry   bag   so   everything   stays   together   in   my   day   bag   when   i   m   out   of   the   house .   br   br   some   other   reviewers   had   problems   with   the   flange   i   haven   t   had   any   issues   so   far ,   but   medela   includes   an   extra   two   or   three   flanges   with   the   pump ,   so   it   s   an   easy   fix   if   something   happens .   and   yes ,   condensation   builds   up   in   the   tubing   during   a   pumping   session ,   but   i   ve   never   had   the   condensation   reach   even   halfway   down   the   tube   toward   the   motor .   and   the   instruction   book   clearly   says   that   if   you   run   the   pump   detached   from   the   bottle   for   a   few   minutes   after   you   re   done   pumping ,   the   condensation   clears   out .   works   like   a   charm !
leaks   and   overflows   on   it   s   own   horrible   for   car   rides   leather   seats   purchased   4   of   these   thinking   they   would   be   perfect   for   our   toddler   who   was   recently   weaned   off   her   bottle .   the   first   thing   that   drew   me   to   them   was   the   straw .   our   daughter   is   still   learning   the   concept   of   tipping   her   head   back   to   get   her   milk   water   juice ,   so   those   kinds   of   cups   were   out .   the   second   thing   i   liked   about   it   twist   n   click   straw   cup   was   that   it   had   boldly   written   on   the   packaging   leak   proof   guarantee   .   the   last   thing   that   drew   me   to   them   was   their   adorable   design .   something   fun   and   girly   for   my   little .   br   br   the   truth   is   that   this   cup   leaks .   a   lot .   my   daughter   has   now   found   it   more   facinating   to   shake   the   cup   upside   down   and   watch   the   drips   of   milk   come   falling   down   onto   our   dog   or   even   better ,   the   leather   seats   in   our   suv .   fantastic   when   you   combine   milk   and   70   degree   weather .   the   other   major   issue   with   this   cup   is   that   it   over   flows   on   its   own .   i   will   fill   up   the   cup   to   the   inside   line   assuming   it   is   playtex   s   way   of   indicating   a   fill   line   ,   then   twist   the   cup   until   it   meet   the   lock   zone   indicated   on   the   cup   coordinating   with   the   little   arrow   on   the   lid .   then   set   it   down   on   the   counter ,   table ,   high   chair ,   etc .   come   back   in   a   minute   and   you   ve   got   a   puddle   of   liquid   with   bubbles   come   up   out   from   the   straw .   great ,   another   mess   to   clean   up   that   not   even   my   mobile   toddler   had   anything   to   do   with .   br   br   bottom   line   don   t   buy   this   product .   90   of   the   time   i   check   amazon   reviews   before   i   purchase   things   because   it   is   more   than   helpful   in   making   good   purchases .   wish   i   had   looked   on   amazon   before   purchasing   these   cups .   it   is   now   a   great   bath   toy .
kids   will   love   it .   good   quality ,   will   have   to   wait   to   see   how   it   holds   up   under   the   baby   test .   the   product   looks   just   as   pictured   and   the   packaging   and   shipping   were   as   promised .
worth   every   penny   although   this   blanket   appears   to   be   pricey ,   i   personally   think   that   it   is   worth   every   penny .   my   daughter   loves   this   blanket .   i   bought   it   for   her   when   she   was   a   new   born .   i   have   found   it   to   be   a   great   year   round   blanket .   now   at   18   months   of   age ,   my   daughter   is   in   love   with   this   blanket   and   drags   it   around   like   linus   from   the   peanuts .   we   own   many   different   types   of   blankets ,   but   i   would   have   to   say   that   i   wish   that   i   just   had   two   of   these   and   none   of   the   others .   br   br   the   blanket   breathes   well .   because   of   its   insulating   properties ,   it   is   cool   enough   in   a   blistering   summer ,   and   adds   just   enough   warmth   during   the   winter   as   well .
great   the   animal   is   great ,   very   mobile ,   though   a   little   quiet   on   some   of   the   settings .   my   baby   loves   it ,   maybe   not   the   weird   whale   sounds   as   much   though .
sippy   cup   i   could   not   find   a   cup   for   my   son   and   he   drank   from   this   one   during   the   first   try ! !   great   cup ,   doesn   t   leak   and   very   easy   to   use .   can   t   go   wrong   with   this   cup !
love   em   we   love   these   bottles .   the   extra   pieces   to   wash   aren   t   really   a   pain ,   we   either   just   soak   them   in   hot   suds   then   rinse   or   put   them   in   the   munchkin   dishwasher   basket   and   run   them   in   there .
not   safe .   beware .   i   purchased   this   play   pen   3   months   ago ,   it   s   never   been   used   other   than   to   hold   toys   and   there   is   a   large   tear   in   the   seam   on   the   front   just   like   another   reviewer   which   makes   it   a   strangulation   hazard .   the   company   was   very   rude   when   i   called   and   finally   said   i   have   to   pay   to   ship   it   back   to   them   for   it   to   be   repaired   it   s   heavy   and   would   probably   cost   20   just   to   ship   it   back   .   the   fact   that   this   has   torn   from   no   use   makes   me   wonder   how   they   have   not   been   recalled .   also   the   pad   in   the   bottom   is   not   big   enough ,   there   are   gaps   on   each   side ,   which   also   seems   very   unsafe .   i   would   not   trust   that   my   child   would   be   safe   in   this   and   i   would   not   recommend   this   company   or   this   product .
thin   and   rough   although   i   love   the   color   and   trim   and   the   idea   that   it   is   organic   cotton ,   i   am   looking   for   a   new   hooded   towel   and   wash   cloth   for   my   baby .   the   terry   is   very   thin ,   and   it   is   so   rough   i   cannot   believe   it   is   intended   for   a   baby ... i   would   not   even   want   to   use   the   wash   cloth   on   myself .
just   what   i   needed   works   perfectly !   my   sister   uses   it   all   the   time ,   it   is   a   good   quality   price   relationship .   i   strongly   recommend   this   product
cute   i   will   use   this   for   pictures   not   so   much   for   the   main   puropose   of   being   a   toy .   good   size   though
perfect !   i   love   this   pillow !   it   s   a   comfortable   size   and   it   doesn   t   flatten   out   with   use .   it   provides   good   support ...   my   low   back   has   felt   much   better   since   i   started   sleeping   with   this   pillow .
great   monitor ,   but   wrecks   my   wifi   network !   the   infant   optics   dxr   5   system   could   not   be   easier   to   setup   literally   plug   it   in   and   turn   it   on !   the   range   works   great   all   the   way   through   and   around   our   2   story   home ,   in   all   rooms   and   outside   ,   the   video   is   clear ,   the   audio   is   loud   and   clear ,   and   the   infrared   makes   even   a   pitch   black   room   easy   to   see .   my   only   and   major   complaint   is   the   system   s   interference   on   my   home   wireless   network !   while   this   amazon   page   says   use   with   other   2.4 gh   devices   without   worry ,   the   instructions   with   the   unit   clearly   state   may   cause   interference   with   home   networks   using   2.4 gh   signals .   alas ,   this   is   the   case   with   ours ,   and   it   s   no   little   bump   in   our   network   with   the   unit   on ,   we   drop   from   20mb   to   less   than   2mbs   sometimes   a   complete   disconnect   .   while   we   ll   keep   the   unit   for   nighttime   use ,   this   issue   renders   it   useless   during   the   days   when   i   work   from   home ... perhaps   having   an   option   to   change   the   channel   for   the   signal   would   help   with   the   problem  
great !   haven   t   used   yet   because   our   son   hasn   t   been   born   but   it   looks   great !   arrived   on   time .   the   packaging   by   amazon   was   ridiculous ,   huge   unnecessary   box   36   x   24   x   13.5   with   copious   amounts   of   paper   for   filler .   probably   about   20   feet   of   brown   paper   shoved   in   the   large   box   just   to   keep   a   smaller   box   32   x   16   5.5   inside   of   it   from   shifting   in   delivery .   i   don   t   know   why   amazon   couldn   t   have   just   slapped   a   sticker   on   the   smaller   box   and   called   it   done ...   could   have   saved   on   some   shipping   costs   you   would   think .
mesh   fabric   molds   very   easily !   i   have   this   bather   for   my   son   and   i   have   always   wrung   it   out   and   hung   it   up   to   dry   after   every   use   and   always   wash   it   in   the   machine   once   a   week   and   still   it   has   mold   spots !   it   is   quite   disgusting   and   the   pillow   part   smells .   although   the   functionality   of   this   seat   was   nice ,   they   need   to   use   a   better   fabric   that   is   anti   microbial .   i   am   putting   this   in   the   trash   today   and   am   searching   for   something   better   as   we   speak !
leaking ! ! !   i   bought   these   bottles   and   i   thought   they   would   leak ..   and   i   am   so   right !   they   did   leak !   i   really   liked   them ..   and   they   seemed   like   a   good   idea ..   but   i   have   had   them   leak   each   and   every   time .   when   you   are   breast   pumping   your   breast   milk   is   like   gold .   you   can   t   just   mix   up   another   bottle ....   dislike !
it   turns   off   the   ir   when   your   not   viewing   the   video ! ! !   i   bought   one   of   these   and   tested   today   for   the   first   time .   br   br   i   became   very   happy   with   the   smart   two   way   communication   of   this   device .   beyond   the   fact   of   the   product   allow   the   parents   to   talk   to   the   baby   over   voice ,   it   turns   off   the   infrared   lights   of   the   camera   when   you   are   not   viewing   the   baby !   br   br   normally   i   don   t   like   motorola   products ,   but   this   is   over   my   spectations !   br   br   thank   you   amazon . com !
great   product   this   product   is   great   leaves   ur   hands   free   and   makes   breastfeeding   in   public   easy !   easy   to   use   and   a   great   price .   i   would   recommend   this   to   any   one .
moderate   bottle   this   bottle   was   better   than   some   but   not   the   best   for   us .   i   like   the   shape   as   it   is   like   a   breast   and   allows   for   a   good   latch   however   the   nipple   is   somewhat   awkwardly   shaped   and   not   very   flexible .   my   little   one   didn   t   like   it .   also   the   venting   could   be   better   as   well .   the   best   bottle   that   we   have   found   is   the   playtex   that   uses   the   drop   in   liners ... shaped   perfectly   and   is   soft   flexible   and   the   drop   in   liners   allow   for   proper   suction   venting .
dont   buy   baby   trend !   on   the   surface   this   looks   like   a   good   company ,   as   they   are   carried   by   baby   r   us   and   other   fine   retailers .   i   actually   received   three   baby   trend   items   as   gifts   for   my   baby   shower .   i   received   the   monkey   around   play   yard ,   monkey   bouncer ,   and   the   monkey   high   chair .   the   play   yard   and   the   bouncer   were   both   missing   pieces   that   i   had   to   call   the   company   and   order .   the   pieces   were   mailed ,   but   upon   inspection ,   i   was   mailed   the   wrong   pieces .   i   had   to   call   again   to   get   the   right   part .   a   week   later   i   had   a   friend   over   with   their   child   and   offered   my   baby   trend   feeding   chair   for   use .   i   had   put   it   together   a   month   earlier   to   make   sure   there   were   no   missing   pieces   this   time .   however ,   as   i   tried   to   undo   the   safety   buckles ,   the   release   clamp   was   fused   shut   on   one   side ,   and   the   other   took   two   people   to   pull   apart .   i   would   understand   if   one   product   from   them   was   defective ,   but   three   back   to   back   it   s   really   unacceptable   from   a   company   that   charges   money   for   products   that   don   t   work ,   are   missing   pieces .   how   hard   is   it   to   make   a   product   of   plastic   pieces   that   fit   together   ! !
gets   the   job   done   first ,   yes ,   you   will   have   to   swirl   milk   a   little   that   s   the   norm   for   warmers .   and ,   yes ,   there   will   sometimes   be   a   little   water   still   in   the   bottom   and   it   will   gradually   rust   the   heating   element .   again ,   normal .   but ,   this   one   works   and   works   fast !   br   br   i   read   through   the   instructions ,   lamented   at   the   long   heating   times ,   the   various   water   amounts ,   etc .   and   then   it   turned   out   that   none   of   that   matters .   don   t   overfill   the   measuring   cup   but   play   around   with   water   amounts   until   you   find   one   that   works   for   the   typical   amount   of   milk   you   heat .   the   heating   times   in   the   booklet   are   for   ideal   temp ,   i   suppose ,   but   it   s   warmed   enough   by   the   time   the   light   turns   off   assuming   you   used   enough   water   for   the   amount   you   re   heating   .   br   br   two   minor   problems   though   the   unit   is   very   light ,   so   it   s   easy   to   tip   over   while   turning   it   on   until   you   get   the   knack   for   it   pushing   down   on   the   switch   button   while   bracing   it   from   underneath   with   the   same   hand   there   s   a   little   shelf   bit   under   the   front   of   the   unit   for   you   to   do   this   .   also ,   the   adapter   ring   is   very   irritating   to   have   to   put   in   out   every   time .   even   if   you   have   a   thinner   bottle   i   have   some   dr .   brown   s   they   heat   just   fine   in   this   ,   you   end   up   knocking   out   or   flipping   the   ring   about .   but ,   you   still   need   the   ring   even   with   a   bottle   you   can   slip   in   because   it   heats   the   milk   so   much   more   efficiently   with   the   ring .   br   br   still ,   it   s   a   good   product   and   you   can   t   beat   the   price   or   the   speedy   warming .   i   d   give   it   5   stars   if   it   wasn   t   so   darn   easy   to   tip   over   when   pushing   down   on   the   button .   br   br   edit   when   i   bought   this ,   i   believe   it   was   16 .   now   it   s   40 ...   i   would   pay   20 ,   but   i   would   never   pay   40   for   this .   btw ,   yes ,   the   blue   measuring   cup   and   its   slot   need   periodic   cleaning   of   algae   even   though   it   doesn   t   store   water   this   is   easy   and   quick   to   do   though .
i   love   thirsties   covers !   i   have   been   cding   my   baby   for   eight   months   now .   i   started   out   with   aios   but   found   that   i   prefer   the   cost   effective   prefolds   with   snappis   and   covers .   i   used   the   duo   size   1   with   small   prefolds   for   seven   months   and   they   fit   great   until   baby   reached   between   16   and   17   pounds ,   the   same   time   she   outgrew   the   small   prefolds .   the   medium   prefolds   fit   okay   in   the   size   1   if   folded   down   in   the   back ,   and   i   probably   could   have   stretched   them   out   to   fit   until   the   specified   18   pounds ,   but   as   stated   in   other   reviews ,   they   are   rather   narrow   which   is   great   for   the   smaller   prefolds ,   but   not   so   much   for   the   bigger   sizes   .   i   went   ahead   and   ordered   one   size   2   duo   to   find   out   how   well   it   fit .   these   are   much   wider   than   the   size   1   and   fit   the   medium   prefolds   great ,   although   i   still   have   to   fold   them   down   in   the   back   when   the   rise   is   on   the   smallest   setting .   i   love   thirsties   for   the   extra   leg   gusset ,   we   haven   t   had   a   poop   explosion   that   this   cover   couldn   t   handle ,   even   when   the   poop   managed   to   get   all   the   way   around   the   prefold   inside   the   cover !
cute   idea   the   pacifier   looks   exactly   as   pictured   and   seems   to   be   of   good   quality .   i   will   have   to   wait   to   see   if   it   holds   up   to   the   baby .
dry   disappointed   with   this   product .   the   ink   pad   arrived   dry   as   a   bone .   i   had   to   sprinkle   water   on   it   which   created   a   horrible   mess .   did   not   wash   off   easily   as   described   on   label .   my   son   still   has   ink   under   his   nails   from   2   weeks   ago !   would   not   purchase   again .
handy ,   but   not   perfect   by   any   means   we   have   had   this   egg   since   our   baby   was   born   and   at   first   it   freaked   my   husband   out .   the   temperature   settings   are   more   in   line   with   preferences   in   countries   outside   of   the   us ,   in   particular   europe .   the   preferred   settings   for   the   thermometer   are   in   the   60   s .   here   in   georgia   our   room   temperatures   are   rarely   ever   below   70 ,   so   the   egg   is   constantly   orange   or   red   with   it   s   dismal   frowny   face   showing .   i   have   not   had   issues   with   sensitivity ,   often   when   i   sit   next   to   it   in   the   glider   to   breast   feed   it   flares   up   to   80   because   my   body   heat .   overall   it   is   accurate ,   though   it   s   preferred   settings   don   t   often   agree   with   our   home   settings .
good   buy   purchase   it   for   our   daughter ,   she   decorated   her   new   baby   s   room   with   it .   good   quality   she   said .   she   really   likes   it .
the   closest   thing   to   breast ! ! !   i   am   a   mother   of   two .   used   these   with   my   daughter   who   was   only   breast   feeding   up   to   the   age   of   4   months   and   had   no   trouble   switching   her   to   these .   my   son   was   breast   feeding   and   using   the   bottle   from   day   one .   switching   back   and   forth .   i   bought   a   nuk   bottle   since   it   was   what   he   was   used   to   in   the   hospital   but   he   kept   chocking   on   it .   them   i   switched   to   these   again   and   no   problem   back   and   forth   with   breast   and   bottles .   br   these   are   the   only   ones   that   are   designed   like   the   breast   and   have   no   weird   shapes   all   the   other   bottles   have   that   shoot   up   the   milk   on   the   top   of   the   baby   s   mouth   very   unlike   the   breast   .   i   also   bought   the   anti   colic   ones   in   the   beginning   but   i   really   don   t   think   bottles ,   drops   or   any   old   thing   can   improve   colics .   i   found   they   where   not   worth   the   trouble .   im   in   love   with   these   bottles .   i   always   recommend   them   to   all   my   friends   who   are   expecting .
good   kids   suspenders   these   are   nice   suspenders   and   do   their   job   well .   br   br   also ,   they   are   very   long   for   my   2   year   old ,   so   hopefully   they   will   last   for   a   long   time   until   he   is   6   or   7   .   br   br   the   color   could   be   a   little   bit   brighter   though .   if   i   could   choose   a   brighter   blue   color ,   i   would .
innovative   design   i   should   have   held   off   on   purchasing   since   the   hospital   will   give   me   a   pacifier   but   i   see   a   whole   lot   of   babies   using   this
good   item ,   but ...   is   it   new   this   item   was   sent   to   me   and   it   was   not   new   it   was   supposed   to   be   new   ,   it   had   scratches   all   over   and   greasy   human   fingerprints   inside ! !   it   was   not   igienic   for   my   newborn !   i   sent   it   back   immediately !
baby   s   favorite !   i   tried   a   couple   of   other   pacifiers   nuk   and   playtex   and   baby   girl   liked   them   just   fine .   i   pulled   the   free   phillips   pacifier   from   the   hospital   out   because   she   was   gumming   my   fingers   after   eating .   she   loved   it   and   i   immediately   ordered   two   more .   she   alternates   between   sucking   and   gumming   and   i   don   t   know   which   she   enjoys   more .   super   easy   to   clean   and   doesn   t   get   water   trapped   inside   like   some   pacifiers .   my   only   complaint   is   that   i   don   t   know   of   an   easy   way   to   use   a   pacifier   clip .
yankees !   so   of   course   i   can   t   not   have   my   baby   represent   the   ny   yankees ,   born   and   bred ,   perfect   quality   and   very   durable   the   vinyl   colors   don   t   seem   to   be   wearing   off .   i   love   it
the   only   pacifier   he   will   take   although   my   son ,   is   not   a   lover   of   pacifiers ,   when   he   is   overtired ,   worked   up ,   and   or   teething   .   .   this   is   the   only   pacifier   he   will   take .   it   is   a   blessing   that   there   are   other   items   out   there ,   that   can   give   me   a   break   from   nursing .
omg   you   have   to   admit   to   funny   and   cute   as   soon   as   i   saw   this   i   thought   it   was   too   funny   and   cute   not   to   mention   accuate .   lol   it   even   came   with   a   pacifier   protector   to   keep   it   clean .
so   easy   to   use !   i   love   this   item .   it   was   so   easy   quick   to   use   which   is   a   must   for   any   new   parent .   the   built   in   fill   line   is   very   convenient .   everything   can   be   done   with   one   hand   from   filling   water ,   to   putting   the   cover   on ,   dumping   water   afterwards ,   and   taking   the   top   off .   br   br   i   also   like   the   paci   hanger   it   worked   with   my   soothie   pacificiers   that   have   no   ring   just   slip   soothie   hole   onto   tree   arm   it   fits   .   i   also   like   how   the   pacifiers   do   not   sit   in   the   water   but   instead   hang   up   to   sterilize ,   avoiding   potential   for   water   to   seep   into   nipple   stay   .   lastly ,   the   fact   that   it   sterilizes   in   60   seconds   and   is   very   small   compact   for   storage   is   awesome !
love ! ! !   my   4   month   old   loves   this   thing .   he   will   only   sleep   swaddled ,   and   when   i   would   lay   him   down   his   binki   would   fall   out .   i   d   put   it   back   in   and   hold   it   in   place   until   he   drifted   back   to   sleep   then   he   d   drop   it   again   and   wake .   now ,   i   place   his   wubbanub   on   his   chest   with   the   binki   in   his   mouth   and   when   he   drops   or   spits   out   the   binki ,   it   s   still   right   there   in   reach   for   him   to   latch   on   to   it   as   he   pleases .   of   course ,   when   he   squirms   it   sometimes   fall   off   his   chest ,   but   with   this   product   i   can   find   the   paci   a   lot   faster   at   night .   get   one !
life   saver   for   newborns   but   please   stop   using   after   the   intended   months !   so   this   was   a   lifesaver   for   my   newborn !   he   was   breastfed   for   the   first   3months   n   it   really   helped   to   not   confuse   him .   but   also   he   was   an   extremely   fussy   baby   n   still   is . but   we   made   the   mistake   of   giving   it   to   him   for   fussiness , sleeping   everything .   he   became   attached   to   it   very   quickly   and   wouldn   t   take   any   other   pacifier   when   we   were   suppose   to   transition   him   off   of   it .   but   i   thought   no   big   deal   what   could   it   hurt .   well   he   is   now   5months   old   and   he   did   what   they   he   could   do .   i   had   read   of   babies   being   able   to   stick   the   whole   thing   in   their   mouth   n   i   too   was   a   little   skeptic   about   it   but   today   he   accomplished   it !   n   thank   goodness   i   was   holding   him   when   he   did   it   because   i   had   been   putting   him   to   bed   with   it   and   it   could   of   been   a   lot   worse .   so   yes   some   moms   say   that   they   have   older   babies   taking   it   with   no   problems   which   might   be   the   case   but   don   t   take   the   risk !   because   when   your   baby   starts   teething   like   mine   they   want   everything   in   their   mouth   and   they   get   aggressive   with   it   and   believe   it   or   not   but   they   can   fit   it   in   their   mouth !   i   hardly   write   reviews   but   i   felt   it   was   really   important   to   let   others   know   so   no   accidents   happen !   so   a   great   pacifier   for   the   beginning   but   make   sure   you   transition   into   a   new   one ! ! !
no   more   searching   for   the   paci   in   the   night !   love   this   so   much   i   ordered   another !   i   initially   bought   this   in   order   to   find   the   binki   more   quickly   in   the   night .   come   to   find   out ,   my   4   month   old   can   manipulate   the   binki   a   lot   easier   and   is   able   to   put   it   in   on   his   own .   he   occupies   himself   taking   it   out ,   loooking   at   it ,   and   placing   it   back   in   his   mouth   over   and   over .   he   is   now   5   months   old   and   chews   on   the   animal   s   feet   to   soothe   his   inflamed   gums !

great   idea !   i   purchased   this   binkie   as   a   joke   for   my   hubby ..   he   constantly   is   looking   for   my   daughters   pacifiers   and   refers   to   them   as   her   mute   button ,   so   when   i   saw   this   paci ..   i   had   to   get   it ..   right   now   it   hangs   on   a   ribbon   on   our   rear   view   mirror ..

crib   is   pretty   good ,   but   does   have   a   chemical   smell   when   received   we   received   the   tuscany   about   1.5   weeks   ago   and   when   we   first   opened   it   up ,   the   crib   had   a   very   strong   paint   smell   to   it .   we   didn   t   immediately   put   it   together   because   we   were   concerned   about   the   smell   and   whether   it   was   safe .   we   called   storkcraft   and   talked   to   a   representative   about   the   product .   they   noted   that   the   paint   is   non   toxic   and   they   recommend   ventilating   it   for   1   2   weeks   in   a   well   ventilated   area   to   reduce   the   smell .   we   then   researched   on   the   materials   and   laws   required   for   baby   furniture   manufacturers   and   re   verified   with   storkcraft   via   their   customer   service   line .   br   we   decided   to   give   the   crib   a   try   after   much   research   and   verification   that   they   did   use   non   toxic   paints   and   the   board   did   not   contain   formaldehyde   based   products .   br   we   have   been   airing   it   out   for   about   1   week   now   and   so   far   the   smell   has   subsided .   so   far ,   so   good ...   br   br   installation   of   the   crib   was   simple   enough   and   instructions   were   clear .   br   the   paint   on   the   wood   scratched   a   bit   when   i   scraped   a   screwdriver   on   it   due   to   missing   the   screw   head .   i   would   recommend   that   if   your   child   chews   on   the   crib ,   you   should   check   to   make   sure   despite   the   paint   being   non   toxic .   br   it   seems   sturdy   and   we   tried   letting   our   daughter   nap   in   it   today .   so   far ,   so   good ...
lid   too   tight   for   hamper ...   my   daughter   got   this   off   her   baby   registry   and   i   helped   her   unpack   it   and   do   laundry   for   the   new   baby   clothes .   hamper   is   very   sturdy ,   the   colors   are   vibrant .   the   only   problem   is   the   lid   was   so   tight   it   caused   the   hamper   to   buckle   in   on   the   sides .   if   we   hadn   t   already   opened   it   and   used   it ,   i   would   have   urged   her   to   return   it .   br   br   update   thanks   to   another   reviewing   informing   me   that   the   hamper   lid   goes   on   the   inside ,   not   the   outside   duh !   can   t   believe   i   didn   t   figure   that   out ...   ,   i   m   updating   my   review   from   3   to   5   stars .   nice   for   a   child   or   a   baby   because   it   holds   lots   of   soiled   clothes   until   you   re   ready   to   do   laundry   and   the   green   and   pink   colors   are   very   nice .   i   like   that   you   can   toss   your   clothes   on   the   lid   and   it   drops   right   in   without   having   to   remove   the   cover .
a   total   lie !   replacement   different   from   the   one   that   comes   with   your   sippy   cup   at   first   i   realized   that   the   replacement   wasn   t   as   big   as   the   one   that   the   sippy   cup   comes   with ,   but   that   didn   t   seem   like   a   problem   till   i   used   it .   br   br   what   a   messssss .   since   the   diameter   is   smaller   and   doesn   t   match   the   diameter   of   the   lid ,   when   your   child   is   drinking   it   leaks   from   the   boarders .   i   just   doesn   t   attach   well .   i   will   upload   some   pictures   later   so   i   can   better   explain   myself .   br   br   anyway ,   every   time   my   son   used   the   sippy   cup   with   the   replacements   he   would   get   entirely   wet   from   the   leaks .   br   br   i   wanted   to   return   them ,   but   unfortunately   i   didn   t   have   the   time   or   the   energy .   a   total   waste   of   money !   br   br   fyi ,   i   think   these   sippy   cups   are   great .   but   since   my   son   chews   them   and   start   leaking ,   it   is   a   shame   that   they   sell   a   replacement   that   doesn   t   work   as   one .
best   bib   ever   my   daughter   wants   more   for   their   baby .   it   keeps   her   neck   dry   when   breast   or   bottle   feeding   and   it   is   comfortable   for   mother   and   baby .   i   wish   these   were   around   when   i   had   babies .   i   hated   the   milk   pooling   around   their   necks .   a   must   for   every   baby .
lots   of   compartments   this   is   great   in   taking   things   you   need   on   the   go .   i   like   the   black   color   because   you   can   t   see   it   when   it   gets   stained .   plus   it   hold   your   bottle ,   containers   of   food   in   place .   i   am   recommending   this   to   everyone .
easy   to   use   and   durable   this   gate   sees   a   lot   of   action   at   our   house .   we   are   constantly   opening   and   closing   it   and   there   is   quite   often   a   toddler   trying   his   hardest   to   break   the   whole   thing   down .   it   has   held   up   to   all   of   our   abuses   and   is   an   excellent   gate   overall .   the   gate   was   really   easy   to   install ,   i   did   it   myself   in   about   10   minutes .   opening   and   closing   it   is   really   easy   for   me ,   but   my   toddler   has   yet   to   figure   it   out .   we   use   it   at   the   bottom   of   the   stairs   to   keep   him   from   going   up   and   it   has   served   us   well .   great   price ,   highly   recommend .
ugly   but   gets   the   job   done   we   put   this   cover   at   the   base   of   our   fire   place   to   stop   our   toddler   from   cracking   her   head   when   she   was   learning   to   walk .   the   picture   pretty   much   says   it   all .   it   will   not   be   a   fashionably   dramatic   addition   to   your   living   space   but   you   will   keep   it   after   seeing   your   kid   fall   and   bang   her   head   on   the   edge   of   what   might   have   been   a   granite   stone   edge   but   instead   was   a   good   layer   of   foam .
great   quality ,   greay   buy !   i   ordered   this   set   for   my   new   son   s   nursery   and   received   it   today .   i   could   not   be   happier !   the   quality   is   amazing ,   the   colors   are   beautiful ,   and   you   can   t   beat   the   price !   i   would   highly   recommend   this !   you   won   t   be   disappointed .
frontier   85   redeemed   britax   for   me   my   son   was   ready   to   move   out   of   his   britax   diplomat   which   we   hated .   we   had   almost   lost   confidence   in   britax   because   his   previous   seat   was   so   bad .   but   after   reading   all   of   the   reviews   we   decided   that   we   would   give   the   frontier   85   a   chance .   we   are   so   glad   we   did !   so   much   easier   to   install   than   the   diplomat .   regardless   of   how   we   positioned   it   we   could   never   get   the   diplomat   to   feel   truly   secure .   the   frontier   is   snug   as   can   be !   so   glad   we   spent   the   money   on   it !   the   only   complaint   i   have   is   my   2.5   year   old   is   very   active   and   in   the   process   of   climbing   in   his   seat   the   cover   always   seems   to   come   off   in   some   way   or   another .   but   this   is   minor   as   it   doesn   t   affect   the   safety   of   the   carseat .
works   great   just   make   sure   you   get   the   right   size   this   is   a   great   product   made   by   medela .   i   use   the   medela   pump   system   so   i   cannot   comment   on   whether   or   not   this   will   work   with   other   pumps   but   i   would   imagine   that   it   would .   before   using   this ,   i   needed   both   hands   to   support   the   pumping   bottles   and   could   not   do   anything   else   while   pumping .   now   that   i   have   this ,   i   can   be   doing   other   things   while   pumping .   love   it !   br   br   i   originally   saw   this   in   babies   r   us   for   a   much   higher   price !   .   there   is   a   great   sizing   chart   on   the   back   of   the   box   which   made   it   really   easy   to   pick   the   right   size .   since   this   is   a   soft   cotton   fabric ,   i   bought   the   size   that   fits   me   now   2   weeks   post   delivery   and   figure   it   would   be   very   simple   to   have   altered   as   i   get   smaller .
really   nice   crib   and   dresser   the   crib   is   beautiful   the   only   thing   is   you   can   see   screws   which   is   why   i   gave   it   a   4   star .   it   is   very   solid   and   easy   to   put   together   my   dad   put   it   together   himself   in   under   2   hours   and   that   was   with   pausing   to   take   a   break !   the   dresser   is   nice   and   sturdy .   definitely   can   not   wait   to   see   my   son   in   it .   what   is   also   great   is   it   included   the   toddler   rail   at   no   extra   charge .   br   br   would   totally   recommend .
sturdy   and   fun !   we   got   this   for   our   10   month   old   daughter   who   will   stand   but   is   completely   uninterested   in   crawling .   she   loves   jumping   up   and   down .   she   laughs   constantly   while   she   s   in   it .   we   were   weary   about   purchasing   this   item   because   we   weren   t   sure   how   sturdy   it   would   be .   rest   assured ,   the   product   is   quite   secure .   br   the   only   drawback   to   the   product   is   that   the   attached   toys   are   limited   and   may   not   appeal   to   a   child   who   is   easily   bored .   br   for   the   price ,   we   were   extremely   pleased .   br   be   warned   that   depending   on   your   child   s   need   for   exploration   and   or   ability   to   self   entertain ,   this   product   may   only   get   a   few   minutes   of   use   per   day .   br   over   all ,   we   re   pleased .   it   is   an   excellent   work   out   for   our   still   non   walking   child   who   turns   one   shortly !
superhero   or   superdud   i   was   let   down   by   the   packaging   on   these   wipes .   when   i   got   them   they   were   completely   dry .   completely   dry .   i   struggled   with   opening   them   for   half   an   hour .   so   much   for   easy   open   tops !   .   i   finally   gave   up ,   and   retrieved   and   washed   the   plastic   baby   wipe   container   i   had   just   discarded   from   my   last   set   of   baby   wipes ,   and   used   scissors   to   open   this   package .   i   ran   some   water   in   the   container   and   let   it   soak   up .   i   was   able   to   use   them   in   a   few   days ,   but   they   didn   t   smell   at   all ,   and   were   hard   to   pull   apart .   maybe   because   i   had   to   wet   them   down ,   so   they   stuck   together   more   than   they   did   originally   i   checked   the   original   packaging ,   and   if   there   was   a   hole ,   it   was   small   enough   that   when   i   tried   to   squish   the   air   out   of   the   package ,   it   wouldn   t   let   me .   br   br   the   only   thing   saving   these   from   a   one   star   rating   was   that   i   was   able   to   salvage   them   and   use   them .   they   did   the   trick ,   for   all   the   problems   i   had .
it   s   small   but   adorable   the   rattle   is   admittedly   small ,   but   adorable .   it   s   held   up   remarkably   well   in   the   few   months   that   scarlett   s   been   gnawing   on   it .   i   would   buy   another   for   a   baby   shower   basket .
greatest   covers   love   these   covers .   extra   cute   and   leak   proof .   my   son   is   4   months   and   18   lbs .   we   have   tried   a   couple   other   covers   and   these   are   the   most   comfortable   for   him   and   havent   had   a   leak   yet .   love   the   velcro   and   the   snaps .
too   perfect   this   teether   was   purchased   for   my   little   guys   as   a   baby   shower   gift ,   and   my   little   guys   were   just   crazy   about   it !   they   both   loved   this   teether   so   much   that   i   had   to   purchase   another   so   that   they   both   could   have   there   own .   i   think   that   the   things   that   they   liked   about   it   were   the   bright   colors ,   and   the   fact   that   not   only   could   they   chew   on   it ,   they   had   the   option   to   play   with   the   individual   pieces   that   they   could   seperate   and   chew   on .   the   things   that   i   liked   about   were   that   it   was   netural ,   it   could   easily   be   used   for   a   boy   or   a   girl .   i   have   twin   boys .   and   the   price .   the   only   thing   i   did   i   did   not   like   was   the   fact   that   it   was   the   price   to   ship   was   more   then   the   acutal   toy   but , overall   a   great   value   for   something   that   my   little   guys   liked   so   much !   asin   b000m49mo4   fisher   price   monkey   teether   rattle  
cute   little   horse   these   was   purchased   for   a   baby   shower   and   the   expectant   mother   was   thrilled .   it   is   a   nice ,   old   fashioned   sort   of   gift .   it   is   rather   small ,   so   i   suspect   3   is   about   as   old   as   you   can   be   and   ride   it .   the   main   and   tail   could   have   been   of   higher   quality   silky   cord ,   also   the   smell   was   so   pungent   when   it   was   first   out   of   the   box   and   put   together .   it   took   some   vinegar   and   a   week   to   get   the   stink   away .   so ,   if   you   are   buying   it   as   a   gift ,   i   recommend   a   week   to   assemble   and   de   smell   it .
good   protection   but   would   be   nice   if   it   could   be   put   upside   down .   we   have   used   this   product   over   my   2   babies ,   works   good   but   when   you   want   to   protect   a   table   with   a   rounded   top   edge   it   doesn   t   work   unless   you   attach   it   from   the   bottom .   would   be   nice   if   they   made   one   that   fits   top   bottom   of   a   corner .
would   not   do   without   them   i   had   these   nursers   when   i   had   my   children   20   years   ago .   so   i   knew   that   i   had   to   get   some   for   my   new   grand   baby .   would   not   do   without   them .   i   could   not   find   them   in   any   stores .   online   was   my   only   option .   they   came   shipped   as   ordered   and   on   a   timely   basis .   thanks   so   much .
amazing ! !   easy   and   fun   way   to   feed   your   child !   i   am   so   glad   i   found   the   baby   dipper   feeding   set !   it   has   made   it   fun   and   easy   to   feed   my   son .   i   wish   i   would   have   had   this   sooner !   great   product !
love   i   cloth   diaper   my   daughter   so   these   bags   are   a   must   have !   this   one   is   my   favorite   by   far .   i   love   that   the   draw   string   allows   me   to   close   the   top .   great   product   all   around !
would   be   great   if   it   performed   the   one   job   it   s   supposed   to   perform .   pros   has   a   straw   so   that   kids   can   drink   while   sitting   up ,   even   if   they   haven   t   mastered   tipping   the   cup   waaaaay   back   to   let   gravity   do   its   thing .   br   br   cons   takes   a   deep   breath   here   we   go ...   br   leaks   these   things   leak .   that   s   the   one   thing   they   re   supposed   to   prevent ,   and   they   fail .   they   leak   out   the   straw .   they   leak   out   the   seal .   they   just   leak .   br   liquid   squirts   they   don   t   have   a   air   pressure   relief   hole ,   so   as   the   contents   of   the   cup   warm   up   to   room   temp ,   expanding   air   pressure   forces   liquid   back   through   the   straw   and   out   onto   your   coffee   table .   if   you   re   unlucky   enough   to   have   closed   the   straw   lid   before   the   cup   warmed   up   and   then   you   flip   the   straw   back   into   ready   position ,   you   get   a   nice   2   3   foot   jet   of   whatever   was   in   the   cup .   awesome   science   lesson   boyle   s   law   !   br   straw   length   too   short .   lots   of   liquid   remains   in   the   bottom .   if   that   s   milk ,   then   you   throw   away   lots   of   sour   milk   remnants .   it   also   insures   that   rather   than   drinking   the   cup   dry ,   your   child   will   have   plenty   of   liquid   to   drizzle   around   the   house ,   see   above .   br   br   i   would   really   love   these   if   they   worked ,   but   sadly   they   don   t .   i   m   about   to   throw   away   two   because   i   spend   a   huge   part   of   my   day   mopping   up   milk   dots   from   all   over   the   house .
great   organizer !   i   love   this   organizer .   it   fits   my   coffee ,   my   camelbak   water   bottle ,   or   any   other   container   i   use .   it   has   a   great   closed   pocket   for   money   that   no   one   sees   so   your   money   stays   safe   and   two   nice   sized   pockets   for   a   key   and   a   phone .   the   only   thing   i   would   change   is   to   add   a   toggle   to   attach   a   pacifier   or   other   leashed   toy   to .
wonderful   for   big   babies !   our   son   is   five   months   old   and   already   weighs   23   lbs .   needless   to   say ,   even   though   he   technically   hadn   t   outgrown   his   infant   carrier ,   he   was   miserable   in   it   and   it   was   way   too   heavy   for   me   to   carry   around   anyways .   he   wouldn   t   stay   in   it   to   use   in   the   stroller   so   it   was   useless .   i   had   to   drive   from   phoenix   to   tucson   around   two   hours   and   couldn   t   stand   to   hear   him   cry   the   whole   way   so   i   went   to   the   store   and   bought   an   evenflo   convertible   that   could   recline .   it   was   better   than   the   infant   seat   in   that   he   did   fall   asleep   during   the   drive   but   once   he   woke   up ,   he   cried .   so   i   continued   to   search   for   something   that   would   make   him   happy .   i   was   looking   for   a   seat   that   reclined   as   much   as   possible .   i   stumbled   upon   the   maxi   cosi   priori   when   i   googled   which   car   seats   were   best   for   big   babies .   the   evenflo   i   purchased   was   around   250   at   babies   r   us   and   was   a   good   seat   but   the   priori   is   literally   heavenly   and   i   found   it   at   albeebaby . com   for   90 !   br   br   i   drove   around   running   errands   today   and   he   couldn   t   help   but   fall   asleep ! !   at   the   end   of   the   day   when   he   was   hungry   and   tired   he   was   a   tiny   bit   fussy   for   a   couple   minutes   on   the   drive   home   and   then   presto   asleep   again !   my   husband   and   i   went   out   to   dinner   tonight   and   the   whole   drive   we   just   kept   smiling   at   each   other   and   thanking   god   for   this   miraculous   seat   because   he   was   either   happy   or   sleeping   the   whole   time .   thank   you   maxi   cosi ! !   br   br   when   i   first   took   it   out   of   the   box   i   was   disappointed   because   it   didn   t   look   like   it   reclined   very   much   but   there   is   a   plastic   piece   on   the   bottom   that   flips   to   the   other   side   in   rear   facing   position   to   make   it   recline   even   more !   it   was   about   the   same   difficulty   as   the   evenflo   to   install   using   the   latch   system .   it   is   a   little   more   difficult   to   make   it   a   tight   fit   because   it   doesn   t   have   the   automatic   tightening   in   the   latches   like   the   evenflo   did .   you   have   to   tighten   it   manually   which   is   kind   of   hard   but   it   helps   to   adjust   it   to   as   close   as   you   can   before   latching   it   so   that   it   just   needs   to   be   a   little   tighter .   someone   mentioned   that   the   buckle   is   too   tight   around   the   legs ,   which   i   could   see ,   but   my   guy   has   some   honking   thighs   and   he   fits   just   fine .   i   find   it   easier   to   loosen   the   straps   when   i   take   him   out   and   then   tighten   it   again   once   he   s   in   so   that   you   have   plenty   of   room   to   adjust   without   risking   pinches .   it   is   easy   to   release   the   straps   and   then   tighten   them   again ,   even   in   the   rear   facing   position .   the   buckle   has   a   cloth   cover   to   protect   the   skin   from   hot   materials   which   is   nice   down   here   in   phx   and   i   also   noticed   that   the   material ,   although   black ,   never   felt   too   warm   although   it   is   march   so   we   ll   see   how   it   does   in   july   .   one   big   bummer   is   that   you   have   to   rethread   the   straps   to   adjust   the   height   but   you   don   t   have   to   do   that   more   than   a   couple   times   throughout   its   life   so   it   s   worth   it   for   such   an   awesome   seat !   br   br   just   a   side   note   we   ordered   it   in   corniche   thinking   it   was   grey   but   it   is   actually   black   with   black   mesh   on   the   sides .   this   is   actually   the   color   we   wanted   but   didn   t   think   it   was   worth   spending   more   for   the   phantom   color .   bonus !

washes   badly   i   ordered   this   binky   for   my   daughter   and   when   you   wash   it ,   the   color   of   the   binky   fades   and   it   becomes   quite   fuzzy .   i   also   ordered   the   monkey   one   and   don   t   seem   to   have   any   problems   with   that   one .   i   would   not   order   this   particular   one   because   of   the   poor   quality   of   the   product .
love   them   and   baby   loves   them   too   these   are   great   the   only   flaw   is   the   stinky   rubbery   smell   after   a   few   weeks .   but   baby   loves   them   and   they   re   all   natural   if   he   doesn   t   mind   the   smell   then   i   don   t   either .
great   monitor   for   mobile   baby   got   this   monitor   18   months   ago ,   still   working   strong .   a   few   minor   things   i   disliked   at   first ,   but   have   gotten   used   to ,   and   are   not   a   big   deal   at   all   br   br   1 .   when   panning   the   volume   is   shut   completely   off .   so ,   if   your   baby   is   crying   and   you   need   to   move   the   camera   to   find   him ,   his   cries   will   cut   out ,   just   for   a   few   seconds .   br   2 .   the   lowest   volume   setting   other   than   mute   is   too   loud   for   me !   i   am   a   light   sleeper ,   i   found   volume   level   1   to   be   too   loud ,   however ,   laying   it   face   down   on   an   insulated   surface   seemed   to   help   me   sleep   just   fine .   br   3 .   zoom   has   just   one   option ,   and   its   kinda   grainy .   not   a   big   deal   but   not   a   clear   image   when   zoom   is   used   and   only   1   level   to   zoom   into .   br   br   this   is   what   i   wanted   from   a   monitor ,   a   basic ,   nice ,   pan   and   scan   monitor   that   works !   no   other   bells   and   whistles .   the   range   on   the   pan   is   amazing ,   with   the   ability   to   view   the   ceiling   all   the   way   to   the   floor   and   both   walls   although   not   a   huge   room   it   is   very   impressive .   pan   and   zoom   are   available   as   a   touch   scroll   button   in   the   front   of   the   monitor   so   you   don   t   have   to   access   the   menu ,   volume   is   not ,   however   we   just   leave   it   on   low   all   the   time   so   thats   not   a   big   issue   for   us .   br   br   sidenote   we   did   have   to   purchase   new   rechargeable   batteries   about   3   months   ago ,   since   then   the   battery   life   has   been   great .   and   by   great   i   mean ,   need   to   charge   all   night ,   fine   for   entire   day   probably   5   6   hours   br   br   all   in   all   for   what   is   out   there   in   the   world   of   monitors ,   this   is   a   great   buy .   i   consider   the   pan   tilt   option   a   necessity   and   wish   other   monitors   would   offer   it   at   a   decent   price   without   all   the   other   fancy   stuff   that   i   don   t   need .
awesome   swing   my   parents   got   this   swing   for   our   daughter   and   it   s   great !   it   plugs   in   the   wall   so   no   need   for   batteries   which   is   nice .   it   has   so   many   different   settings   and   options   which   is   also   nice !   i   like   the   fact   it   has   mirror   for   her   to   look   up   at   and   how   the   little   toys   circulate .   great   swing !
kid   love   is ,   but   has   a   funky   smell   i   don   t   like   my   18   mo   old   daughter   loves   the   chair ,   does   not   try   to   stand   up   in   it   like   she   did   in   the   regular   chair   and   actually   takes   it   out   to   the   deck   when   she   wants   to   sit   outside .   however ,   it   definitely   has   a   funky   smell   like   moldy   fungus   on   the   underside   that   i   only   smell   when   it   is   wet .   i   have   to   call   the   manufacturer   and   see   what   i   can   do   about   it .
you   won   t   regret   it !   i   have   had   this   pillow   for   months   now ,   so   i   feel   i   can   give   an   informed   review .   it   took   about   a   week   to   get   used   to   sleeping   with   it   and   to   break   in   the   part   where   my   head   goes ,   but   since   then   i   have   been   more   than   happy   with   it   in   fact ,   i   had   my   baby   over   a   month   ago   and   i   still   use   it   and   find   it   incredibly   comfortable .   the   best   part   while   i   was   pregnant   was   that   i   slept   more   soundly   with   the   pillow   so   i   didn   t   wake   up   to   go   to   the   bathroom   as   many   times   during   the   night ,   so   i   actually   felt   well   rested   in   the   morning .   the   best   part   now   that   the   baby   is   born   is   that   i   can   fold   it   in   half   in   the   middle   of   the   night   when   the   baby   wakes   up   and   it   becomes   a   backrest   for   nursing   very   comfortable   and   much   better   than   just   leaning   against   a   regular   pillow   because   it   has   arms   for   more   support .   one   thing   though   the   jersey   knit   cover   is   very   comfortable   and   fits   the   pillow   perfectly ,   but   the   regular   cotton   cover   is   not   soft   at   all   and   it   doesn   t   fit   properly   around   that   curved   area   at   the   top   so   it   ends   up   digging   into   your   neck   shoulder   area .   stick   with   the   jersey   cover .
great !   i   love   these   spouts ,   i   used   them   for   my   first   daughter   and   was   trying   to   find   replacements   for   the   cups   for   my   second   daughter   that   just   started   using   sippy   cups .   i   am   glad   i   found   them   on   amazon !
perfect   with   twins   and   two   kids   14   mos   apart   i   have   had   my   share   of   double   strollers .   this   is   a   great   stroller   for   the   mall   or   going   on   walks .   turns   on   a   dime .   exactly   what   i   was   looking   for .   best   thing   about   it   is   it   fits   through   a   doorway !
perfect   for   az   sun ,   stands   up   to   jogging   i   got   this   sunshade   for   my   double   jogging   stroller   because   my   youngest   hates   getting   the   sun   in   her   eyes ,   but   won   t   keep   sunglasses   or   a   hat   on .   yes ,   it   is   basically   just   a   large   piece   of   fabric   that   you   tie   onto   your   existing   sunshade ,   but   it   really   works   great .   my   existing   sunshade   is   flat ,   so   the   flexible   fabric   of   the   protect   a   bub   kind   of   comes   down   a   bit   to   protect   in   the   morning   or   the   afternoon   when   the   sun   is   not   straight   up .   i   wonder   why   a   jogging   stroller   doesn   t   have   a   better   sunshade   it   only   gets   used   outside !   go   figure   i   have   done   both   a   long   run   and   a   sprint   workout   and   there   is   no   sign   of   this   thing   even   loosening   up .   better   yet ,   no   crying   from   the   wee   one   about   the   sun   being   in   her   eyes .   definitely   a   good   investment .
decent ,   but   overly   priced .   we   have   had   this   product   for   about   two   weeks   now   and   is   doing   a   great   job .   i   do   not   think   it   should   have   cost   50 ,   because   the   material   is   not   the   best   if   you   have   a   very   determined   child ,   which   i   do   not   have   thankfully .   we   bought   the   product   because   my   daughter   suddenly   decided   to   try   to   climb   out   of   the   crib ,   and   is   no   where   near   being   ready   for   a   toddler   bed .   she   is   2   yrs   old   next   month .   she   actually   likes   the   tent   effect   so   has   little   interest   in   trying   to   climb   out   now ,   though   i   occasionally   see   her   trying   to   when   i   go   to   check   up   on   her .   we   have   a   thick   foam   mattress   so   can   bend   it   a   little   to   change   the   sheets   so   we   do   not   have   a   problem   changing   the   sheets .
they   work   i   have   several   types   of   wetbags .   i   have   to   admit ,   these   are   the   ones   i   use   as   back   up .   if   i   need   a   wetbag ,   and   all   the   others   are   in   the   wash   or   dirty ,   i   ll   go   to   these .   they   do   work .   they   keep   the   mess   inside .   br   br   the   pros   to   these   are   the   price !   they   keep   the   mess   inside   and   your   diaper   bag   clean .   the   drawstring   does   close   tight   and   keep   odors   moisture   inside .   br   br   the   cons   unlike   other   wetbags   these   bags   are   single   layered   there   s   no   outer   fabric   covering .   when   i   ve   got   a   wet   diaper   in   one ,   it   feels   damp   to   the   touch .   it   s   not   actually   damp   i   ve   tested   to   see   if   it   was   leaking   ,   but   it   s   not   a   pleasant   feeling   when   digging   through   my   diaper   bag .   the   drawstring   gets   really   hard   to   pull   tight .   i   really   have   to   fight   it   at   times   to   close   completely .   zippers   are   so   much   easier .   br   br   all   in   all   they   re   good   for   my   use   as   a   back   up   bag .   i   m   not   sure   i   d   use   on   a   regular   basis   though .
baby   seems   to   settle   down   but   not   like   a   car .   the   fisher   price   cruisin   motion   soother   is   a   great   idea ,   it   has   a   wheel   that   turns   inside   the   unit   to   mimic   the   turning   wheels   of   a   car ,   also   offers   music   and   hanging   toys   overhead .   baby   does   quiet   down   after   she   s   in   it   for   a   while   br   but   not   the   same   as   in   a   real   car .   the   idea   does   work   so   don   t   get   me   wrong ,   for   the   price   i   think   it   offers   enough   help   to   sooth   a   crying   baby   who   doesn   t   want   to   sleep ,   it   s   also   just   a   place   to   entertain .
chicco   key   fit   30   we   all   love   this   car   seat   our   daughter   most   of   all .   she   goes   in   with   a   smile   and   falls   asleep   within   minutes ,   meaning   she   is   really   comfortable   in   it .   installation   of   the   base   is   very   easy ,   so   there   is   less   risk   of   installing   it   wrong .   it   is   lighter   than   other   car   seats   i   researched ,   hence   easier   to   carry .   i   do   not   recommend   getting   the   travel   system   sold   with   the   cortina   stroller .   the   stroller   will   not   fit   in   a   small   car ,   is   cheaply   made   and   very   overpriced .   chicco   does   have   a   smaller   stroller   alternative   that   will   act   as   a   travel   system   the   trevi   but   the   quality   of   the   cortina   has   made   me   want   to   stay   away   from   chicco   strollers .   this   car   seat   however   is   top   notch   and   i   m   very   pleased   with   it .   i   highly   recommend   it .
satisfied   this   was   a   gift   to   me .   it   washed   nicely   following   the   instructions .   looks   as   good   as   the   picture   and   matches   perfectly .   fit   standard   changing   pad   i   got   from   walmart .   very   satisfied ,   would   def   reccomend   this .
my   favorite   cover   we   have   been   cloth   diapering   for   a   little   over   a   month   and   so   far   this   is   my   favorite   cover .   love   the   gussets   at   the   legs   and   the   fits   works   really   well   on   our   5   1   2   month   old .   we   use   mainly   fitted   kissaluvs   with   it   and   it   s   not   too   bulky .   plus   the   print   is   super   cute .
love   this   item !   i   bought   this   product   admittedly   from   a   different   website   because   i   found   it   cheaper   .   i   got   it   in   the   green   color   it   is   adorable .   a   lot   of   reviewers   said   it   was   big   but   it   was   actually   smaller   than   i   had   pictured   it .   i   have   an   18   month   old   a   4   year   old   my   4   year   old   is   skinny   i   do   think   that   it   s   barely   big   enough   for   2   kids .   my   kids   have   not   tried   to   sit   back   in   it   like   lots   of   other   reviewers   stated   so   falling   out   hasn   t   been   an   issue .   i   did   get   the   easel   it   s   on   one   side .   they   love   playing   with   it   when   they   aren   t   using   the   learning   tower   to   help   me   in   the   kitchen .   the   easel   has   a   chalk   board   on   one   side   a   dry   erase   board   on   the   other   side ,   so   you   can   flip   it   whenever   you   want .   both   sides   are   magnetic   as   well   it   comes   with   a   large   magnetic   bar   to   hold   a   piece   of   paper   for   coloring ,   drawing ,   etc .   all   in   all ,   i   am   very   happy   with   this .   i   ve   wanted   one   for   a   while   waited   so   long   because   of   the   price .   but ,   it   s   very   sturdy   i   believe   the   price   is   well   worth   it .   i   m   considering   buying   another   easel   so   they   can   each   have   their   own   as   well .
just   as   described ,   cute   skirt .   the   skirt   is   really   cute   in   person ,   and   a   great   deal   for   the   price .   the   hot   pink   is   definitely   a   bright   pink   color   not   quite   as   muted   as   the   picture   which   is   what   we   were   hoping   for .
keeps   them   dry !   i   bought   this   for   our   recent   trips   to   florida   and   disney .   it   fits   easily   in   the   basket   in   the   stroller   and   can   quickly   be   pulled   out   and   installed   over   top   of   the   stroller .   this   is   especially   important   during   sudden   downpours .   it   s   easy   enough   to   get   on   that   it   s   actually   worth   throwing   it   on   when   you   are   going   inside   or   parking   your   stroller   for   a   while   even   if   you   think   it   s   only   for   a   short   time   .   you   never   know   when   those   popup   showers   will   hit .   it   keeps   everything   underneath   bone   dry .
graco   highchair   this   was   the   perfect   model   for   me   as   a   grandmother   who   has   a   6   month   grandson   that   visits   regularly .   i   have   a   bit   of   a   problem   with   the   harness   button .   it   isn   t   easy   to   release   it .   also   when   preparing   for   storage   the   button   to   release   the   foot   stand   doesn   t   work   or   is   difficult .
a   godsend   of   all   of   the   things   we   ve   bought   for   our   baby ,   this   is   the   item   i   appreciate   the   most .   this   fantastic   chair   is   super   lightweight   and   portable .   when   our   daughter   was   only   a   month   old ,   we   d   put   the   chair   in   the   kitchen   so   she   could   be   with   us   while   we   cooked   and   ate .   we   move   it   all   over   the   house .   she   is   now   5   months   old   and   she   still   loves   the   chair   and   the   toys   that   come   with   it   and   easily   attach   detach .   this   is   the   best   i   have   ever   spent   on   anything   in   my   life .
great   product   this   car   seat   really   lives   up   to   its   hype .   it   is   very   easy   to   use   and   my   daughter   loves .   thanks   amazon ! ! !
simple ,   functional ...   just   what   we   were   looking   for .   we   purchased   this   car   seat   for   our   daughter   and   it   has   worked   out   perfectly .   we   have   the   latch   hooks   in   our   car ,   so   installation   is   a   breeze .   the   only   thing   i   would   change   about   it   is   the   overall   size .   it   simply   does   not   fit   anywhere   but   in   the   center   of   the   back   seat .   i   know   that   s   the   safest   place   in   most   cars ,   but ,   our   bmw   3   series   just   doesn   t   have   the   room   to   put   her   anywhere   else ,   even   though   i   m   sure   it   s   just   as   safe .   the   stroller   itself   is   bulky ,   as   all   the   rest   of   the   reviews   have   said ,   but   we   haven   t   had   an   issue   with   it .   it   still   fits   in   our   trunk ,   so   that   s   all   we   care   about .
wonderful   play   gym   i   bought   this   play   gym   for   my   3   month   old   daughter .   she   loves   to   kick   so   much   i   thought   she   would   enjoy   the   piano .   she   fell   in   love   with   the   mirror   and   the   piano   feature .   she   moves   around   so   much   on   it   that   she   move   out   of   the   view   of   the   mirror   and   then   become   frustrated   because   she   can   no   longer   see   herself .   i   would   definitely   recommend   this   play   gym .   it   has   a   lot   of   features   to   keep   your   little   one   entertained   and   bright   colors   to   excite   them .   my   daughter   also   loves   to   have   tummy   time   on   the   mat   too .
another   great   product   from   recaro !   we   bought   this   seat   for   our   3   year   old   daughter   and   passed   on   her   proride   carseat   to   our   1   year   old   daughter .   we   love   both   carseats !   i   really   love   the   new   way   to   adjust   the   height   of   the   shoulder   straps   i   just   wish   you   could   do   it   without   taking   the   seat   out   of   the   car .   that   being   said ,   we   rated   it   4   out   of   5   stars   because   it   is   not   so   easy   to   install   the   seat   into   a   car .   the   latch   system   is   pretty   simple   to   use   but   it   is   still   not   the   easiest   thing   to   do   especially   when   trying   to   get   the   seat   really   snug .
easiest   installation   ever ! !   i   researched   and   researched   which   car   seat   to   buy   for   about   a   month .   after   not   being   able   to   find   a   store   that   carried   this   car   seat   in   my   area   so   i   could   go   play   with   it   i   found   all   the   other   reviews   to   be   my   insight   to   this   car   seats   pro   s   and   con   s .   i   went   with   the   highest   rated   car   seat   on   the   nhtsa   website .   the   instructions   for   the   installation   was   super   easy   to   understand   and   follow .   installation   was   just   as   easy   using   the   latch   system   .   the   car   seat   will   not   budge   and   the   rubber   base   really   helps   with   that   stability .   my   daughter   is   16lbs   and   very   small   for   her   age   and   it   fits   her   very   comfortably   and   she   has   not   shown   me   otherwise .   she   is   still   facing   backwards .   the   only   con   i   have   on   this   car   seat   is   the   sides   that   would   protect   her   head   in   a   car   crash   are   much   like   horse   blinders .   my   daughter   still   doesnt   seem   bothered   by   it .   i   could   see   a   child   being   bothered   by   it   if   they   were   used   to   seeing   out   on   the   sides   or   they   just   needed   that   stimulation .   i   love   that   it   clicks   once   the   chest   straps   are   tight   enough .   i   find   it   reassuring .   the   height   of   the   headrest   is   also   very   easily   adjusted .   it   is   easy   to   strip   off   the   covering   in   case   you   need   to   wash   it .   its   all   around   the   best   car   seat   for   me .   i   drive   a   toyota   highlander   and   the   back   seat   it   slanted   a   bit .   i   did   have   to   roll   up   a   towel   to   even   it   out   for   the   level   requirements .
perfect   for   children   s   safety   received   this   item   last   week .   easy   to   install .   used   them   on   our   new   bar   counter   top .   in   the   2   weeks   that   we   lived   in   the   house ,   we   had   1   accident   and   3   near   misses   with   our   children   running   around   in   the   house .   this   has   made   the   corners   very   soft ,   just   incase   they   get   too   close   again .   the   color   is   a   little   lighter   that   what   i   had   thought   it   would   be ,   but   it   still   blends   in   with   our   counter   tops .
disappointed   well   my   husband   is   huge   cowboys   fan ,   so   for   our   grandson   these   looked   so   cool ,   and   we   have   orderd   the   baby   bottles   for   him   and   loved   them ,   any   way   back   to   the   sippy   cups ,   they   suck .   my   grandson   turned   red   trying   to   suck   on   them   and   then   throw   them ,   my   husband   tried   to   get   juice   through   them , and   could   not   get   a   drop ,   so   yes   they   are   spill   proof ,   but   also   drinkable   proof   too .   look   cool   but   kinda   useless .
not   waterproof   i   am   really   disappointed   with   this   wet   bag .   the   bag   doesn   t   keep   the   moisture   in .   i   put   a   soiled   diaper   in   the   bag ,   zipped   it   up   and   placed   it   in   my   diaper   bag .   i   later   returned   to   find   that   my   clean   diapers   were   damp   from   placing   the   bag   on   top   of   them .   i   have   to   place   a   plastic   bag   around   the   outside   so   nothing   else   will   get   wet .   had   i   known   this   about   the   bag   i   would   not   have   purchased .
cute !   my   daughter   loves   chewing   on   these .   my   fear   however   is   that   the   regular   elastic   holding   the   beads   could   snap   so   i   m   constantly   checking   how   it   s   holding   up   before   letting   her   play   chew   on   it .
love   our   boba !   i   highly   recommend   the   boba   2g !   as   an   experienced   babywearer   stretch   and   woven   wraps   i   have   to   say   that   the   boba   is   up   there   at   the   top   of   my   favourite   carriers   list .   we   re   on   a   tight   budget   so   price   was   definitely   a   deciding   factor   but   if   you   re   considering   a   soft   structured   carrier ,   don   t   let   the   lower   price   of   the   2g   fool   you   into   thinking   that   it   s   not   as   good   as   a   beco   or   ergo .   my   19lb ,   14   month   old   rides   comfortably   on   my   back   or   front   and   i   can   wear   him   for   extended   periods   of   time   without   getting   a   back   ache .
totally   impressed   this   gate   is   amazing .   i   have   3   of   them   set   up   in   my   home .   they   are   a   little   more   difficult   to   install   than   the   usual   baby   gate ,   but   once   it   s   done ,   they   are   wonderful .   i   had   other   pressure   gates   that   wore   the   wood   down   on   the   door   casing   so   i   had   to   keep   readjusting   so   it   would   be   tight   enough ,   and   then   it   would   wear   the   casing   down   further .   with   these   gates ,   the   presure   holds   the   gate   in   place ,   but   the   swinging   part   of   gate   never   touches   the   wood   casing .   what   a   brilliant   idea !   i   would   recommend   this   gate   to   anyone ,   not   only   for   children ,   but   pets   too .
leaks   when   wet   didnt   really   serve   the   purpose   .   i   had   to   keep   checking   on   it   every   time   my   baby   was   on   it .
light   but   sturdy   i   use   this   stroller   for   my   2   year   old ,   and   she   has   plenty   of   room   to   sit   comfortable   or   to   lie   back   and   nap .   theres   a   small   puffy   pillow   by   her   head   built   into   the   seat .   the   basket   underneath   is   big ,   and   the   handles   are   taller   so   theres   no   hunching   while   pushing .
sleep   all   thru   the   night ! ! ! !   this   is   a   must   have !   my   baby   is   restless   and   this   baby   swaddler   was   a   life   saver !   my   baby   actually   wants   to   be   swaddled ,   it   makes   her   feel   all   cozy   like   she   was   in   the   womb .   when   she   is   feeling   a   little   stressed   out ,   i   just   wrap   her   in   this   and   she   calms   right   down   and   falls   asleep .   one   recommendation   is   to   make   sure   the   velcro   is   covered   before   washing   as   it   make   snag   other   fabrics .   also ,   i   didn   t   know   this   before ,   but   the   little   slot   in   the   booty   are   is   for   a   car   seat   or   swing   buckle ,   so   your   little   one   can   be   snug   as   a   bug   but   still   safe   in   their   seat .   definitely   recommend   this .
love   this   thing .   ladies ,   i   love   this   thing .   debated   buying   it   for   a   month   or   two   since   there   was   little   customer   feedback   on   the   product   then   ,   and   finally   broke   down   and   got   it .   so   glad   i   did .   br   br   i   wish   they   would   have   had   this   pillow   available   a   few   years   back   when   i   had   my   first   son .   br   br   makes   breastfeeding   in   public   much   more   comfortable   and   relaxing   for   both   me   and   my   baby ,   esp   since   i   have   huge   ta   tas   and   it   s   hard   to   just   pop   him   on   and   off ...   br   br   the   one   small   flaw   would   have   to   be   the   clasp   on   the   shoulder   strap .   i   see   why   they   had   to   design   it   that   way ,   it   s   just   a   little   difficult   to   undo   while   you   re   holding   an   infant .   other   than   that ,   it   s   amazing .   br   br   a   must   have   for   moms   who   are   out   and   about   a   lot ! ! !
so   far ,   so   great !   i   switched   to   cloth   diapers   a   few   months   ago   due   to   my   daughter   suffering   from   frequent   rashes .   we   were   trying   to   rid   her   of   a   nasty   yeast   rash   while   using   cloth .   so ,   i   decided   to   try   these   liners   to   1 .   keep   her   skin   dry   and   2 .   protect   cloth   from   barrier   cream !   i   am   happy   to   report   these   liners   keep   her   very   dry   in   terms   of   a   barrier   between   prefold   diapers   that   are   absorbent ,   but   wet   feeling .   this   is   the   perfect   solution !   i   am   very   thankful   for   this   product   and   will   continue   to   use   them .   not   to   mention ,   they   do   a   great   job   protecting   cloth   from   poo   they   catch   the   poo   and   keep   the   cloth   diaper   cleaner .   great   product !
quality   item   very   satisfied   with   this   item .   bright ,   colorful   easy   to   apply .   my   son   loves   it   adds   color   to   my   walls   without   paint .
safety   hazard   although   the   design   of   these   is   to   wind   the   cord   shorter ,   when   a   window   is   open   and   blinds   are   drawn   the   cord   does   get   longer .   i   left   a   room   for   30   seconds   and   came   back   to   see   that   my   son   had   pulled   the   cord   down   and   had   it   wrapped   around   his   neck .   terrifying .   although   these   do   pop   open   easily ,   they   most   definitely   did   not   pop   open   from   the   pressure   of   a   child   s   neck   which   i   find   to   be   a   serious   design   flaw .   from   a   company   named   safety   1st   back   to   the   drawing   board   on   these !
stroller   i   love   it   it   comes   as   shown   in   picture   it   is   easy   to   assemble   as   i   did   it   myself   i   took   it   out   and   it   didn   t   fall   apart   on   me   the   packaging   was   good   ups   in   the   stroller   box   no   rips   in   box   and   it   came   early   than   was   given   will   order   from   seller   again
nice   concept   needs   work !   i   love   this   concept !   my   son   is   able   to   climb   up   to   the   toilet   safely   and   independently .   however   when   he   climbs   up   the   seat   often   moves   back   and   leaves   a   gap   infront .   when   this   happens   his   urine   shoots   out   the   gap   down   the   front   of   the   toilet   and   all   over   the   floor .   this   product   needs   some   adjustment   to   make   it   more   efficient .
great   picnic   blanket   we   had   been   using   a   standard   blanket   for   picnics   but   if   the   ground   was   damp   or   full   of   debris   then   we   were   sure   to   have   problems .   this   blanket   is   very   nice .   fold   and   stores   easily .   its   large   size   accommodates   the   average   family   and   it   wipes   clean .
perfect   first   book !   this   is   the   perfect   first   book !   i   purchased   this   for   my   9   month   old   granddaughter   for   christmas   with   the   hope   that   her   interest   in   books   would   begin   early .   she   s   very   attracted   to   the   vibrant   colors   and   picks   it   up   often   to   look   through   it .   after   reading   the   book ,   we   go   back   through   it   and   i   name   all   the   colors   and   make   up   more   stories   about   each   of   the   very   cute   characters   and   other   illustrations .
good   for   baby   food   i   do   love   these   for   freezing   baby   food   after   we   make   it .   just   be   careful   to   not   fill   them   too   full   or   they   will   expand   and   the   lid   will   pop   off .   the   lids   don   t   screw   down   too   awfully   tight ,   but   they   do   stack   great   and   store   great !
fine   by   me   had   no   problems   with   installation .   perhaps   20   mins .   software   is   as   advertised .   no   bells   and   whistles ,   just   a   monitor   for   ios   that   works .   going   to   get   a   2nd   one .   br   br   bought   a   2nd   one .   again   no   problems   whatsoever .   i   can   toggle   between   the   cameras   with   the   software   by   two   finger   swiping .   ez .
helpful   product   this   kit   was   very   helpful .   i   was   very   relieved   not   to   have   to   drill   into   my   railing   post .   this   product   is   very   solid .   i   did   not   use   the   1   x2   wood   as   my   child   gate   came   with   one   that   was   the   same   color   of   my   railing .   my   only   request   for   this   product   would   be   that   i   wish   it   came   in   different   colors ,   possibly   made   out   of   wood .   now   my   railing   and   child   gate   match   but   i   have   these   white   blocks   that   stick   out   like   a   sore   thumb .   over   all ,   i   am   satisfied   with   this   kit .
motorola   monitor   i   bought   this   not   for   a   baby   but   for   a   way   to   keep   a   watchful   eye   on   an   elderly   parent .   it   has   been   the   perfect   way   to   give   her   some   space   and   not   intrude   all   the   time .   but   yet   make   me   feel   better   i   can   see   and   hear   how   she   is   doing .   i   can   hear   her   clearly   and   she   can   hear   me .   for   her   she   still   has   her   privacy   as   you   can   turn   off   the   visual   feed .   our   house   is   cut   up   in   levels .   and   this   is   the   perfect   way   to   not   have   to   run   up   and   down   steps .   this   was   the   best   thing   i   could   have   gotten   for   our   situation .   no   interference   from   phones ,   computers   or   cell   phones .   picture   is   clear   both   in   daylight   and   with   night   vision .
really   nice   moitor !   it   is   just   right   for   my   needs   to   keep   an   ear   on   the   kids .   lasts   good   and   battery   works   great ! !   it   is   clear   and   the   volume   switch   is   good .
good   fit   these   seem   to   fit   my   newborn   son   6   lbs   4   oz   and   19   inches   long   better   than   the   newborn   diapers ,   even   though   he   isn   t   a   preemie .   the   backs   go   up   a   little   higher   than   the   regular   newborns   but   it   doesn   t   seem   to   get   in   his   way   so   that   s   okay .   swaddlers   in   general   are   some   of   the   best   diapers   i   ve   used .
have   used   this   brand   for   every   child   i   love   the   avent   product   line .   since   i   last   used   them ,   they   have   definitely   improved .   with   the   new   rings   that   hold   the   nipple   in   place ,   i   don   t   have   any   issues   with   the   bottles   leaking .   this   was   a   very   nice   surprise   and   a   change   that   i   don   t   mind   completing   an   extra   step   for .   as   usual ,   they   hold   up   great   and   limit   the   fussiness .   the   pacifier   covers   are   lifesavers   since   i   hate   putting   them   into   the   diaper   bag   without   protection .   with   the   cover ,   i   no   longer   have   to   put   the   pacifiers   into   a   ziplock   bag   to   keep   them   clean .
great   gift   this   was   a   great   toy   for   my   two   granddaughters .   it   s   just   the   right   size   for   their   little   hands   and   grabs   their   attention   with   the   flashing   lights   and   variety   of   music .   the   price   was   very   reasonable .
transfer   stickers   once   i   got   these   transferred   to   the   wall   they   look   beautiful   but   they   can   be   a   little   temperamental   getting   them   on   .   i   would   buy   them   again   and   recommend   them   as   a   beautiful   addition   to   walls .
earthlust   baby   bottle   received   on   time   and   in   good   state .   my   baby   will   by   born   in   june ,   so   i   haven   t   used   it   yet  
highly   disappointed   glowing   globes   were   nice ,   but   do   not   rotate .   the   only   thing   that   rotates   is   not   a   focal   point   of   the   unit ,   and   is   tiny .   music   adjustment   is   3   levels   of   volume   off ,   super   quiet   and   quiet ,   neither   of   which   is   suitable   if   you   use   white   noise   machines   as   it   s   not   loud   enough .   the   projector   is   a   farce .   i   thought   i   got   a   good   deal ,   but   an   old   school ,   mechanical   wind   up   beats   the   pants   off   this   thing .   assembly   is   easy   and   construction   seems   sturdy   enough .   in   the   end   for   such   an   impressive   looking   feature   set   on   paper ,   this   mobile   is   quite   a   dull   immobile .   br   br   would   not   buy   again .
elastic   gives   out ...   the   color   is   great ,   the   material   is   super   soft   washes   well .   .   however ,   the   elastic   gives   out   making   the   sheet   useless !   i   would   not   recommend   that   anyone   buy   this .   loose   bedding   in   a   crib   is   very   dangerous ,   carters   needs   to   change   the   elastic   used   in   making   these   sheets .
i   would   rate   this   transaction   a   zero   if   i   could .   this   was   a   poorly   handled   transaction   from   jj   cole .   they   pre   advertised   this   bag   for   pre   ordering ,   which   i   did .   then   weeks   later ,   it   was   delayed .   well ,   babies   don   t   get   delayed ,   so   my   friend   was   patiently   waiting   for   the   bag   i   told   her   i   would   buy   as   a   baby   gift .   delay   after   delay   after   delay ,   i   finally   got   an   e   mail   saying   it   was   sent .   i   didn   t   even   have   an   option   to   cancel   the   order .   now ,   as   the   baby   is   six   months   old ,   it   is   nice   that   the   bag   finally   arrived .   my   friend   had   to   use   one   of   those   re   usable   green   grocery   sacks .   just   pitiful .   and ,   the   bag   seems   much   smaller   in   person   than   it   appears   as   advertised .
exactly   what   is   to   be   expected !   as   a   young   adult   i   found   i   ve   acquired   many   stuffed   animals   but   had   no   where   to   put   them   short   of   storage .   i   ordered   one   of   these   and   it   was   here   almost   immediately .   not   only   that   but   it   holds   far   more   than   i   was   expecting .   even   left   with   a   little   slack   it   doesn   t   hang   too   low .   i   m   even   thinking   about   buying   one   for   my   2   year   old   nephew .   i   m   100   satisfied   with   this   product   and   the   seller .   will   buy   from   again !
great   stroller   i   feel   the   need   to   write   a   review   here   because   the   one   star   from   the   other   review   has   to   do   with   amazon   s   price   not   the   great   stroller .   small ,   easy   and   well   priced   yes ,   cheaper   at   babies   r   us ...   when   can   you   say   that   !   i   give   it   five   stars   for   what   it   is   although   i   will   be   getting   the   uppababy   g   luxe   so   my   baby   can   take   naps   better   in   it !
great   purchase !   we   bought   3   covers   and   originally   i   planned   to   just   use   them   for   my   21   month   old   for   a   few   months   before   we   potty   train .   but   i   gave   them   a   try   on   our   2   month   old   baby   boy   and   they   also   work   well   for   him !   i   m   really   pleased .   i   also   bought   the   thirsties   hemp   cotton   inserts   to   use   with   this   cover   and   i   m   glad   for   that   purchase   too .   the   thirsties   bumgenius   combination   absorbs   a   lot   of   the   wetness   so   i   m   not   changing   diapers   every   half   an   hour .
nice   item   this   collections   storage   box   easily   fits   in   my   pantry   for   storing   plastic   spoons ,   forks ,   napkins   etc .   love   the   color .   looks   very   pretty .   could   be   used   as   storage   under   a   sink   or   even   to   store   magazines .   pretty   enough   to   have   in   your   living   room .   very   pleased   with   purchase .
silly   cute   great   idea   for   a   pirate   baby   or   for   someone   who   wants   to   inject   a   bit   of   humor   into   the   traditional   pacifier .   not   inexpensive ,   but   fun   for   a   shower   gift .
he   adores   it   our   son   has   had   one   of   these   since   6   months ,   and   now   at   12   months   is   more   attached   to   it   than   ever .   we   now   own   3 !   they   re   adorable   and   practical .
good   to   use   at   night   i   bought   this   pacifier   because   we   have   already   lost   4   of   the   regular   ones   when   my   baby   was   only   2   months   old .   so   i   decide   to   buy   it   and   use   it   at   night ,   because   it   was   really   easy   to   find   when   you   are   so   sleepy .   really   good   purchase ,   i   still   have   it   and   my   son   is   6   months   old ,   now   is   not   only   a   pacifier   but   also   a   toy   for   him .
awesome ! ! !   my   husband   and   i   love   this   bink   link ! !   it   looks   really   cool   and   it   s   so   unique .   my   son   loves   it   as   well   and   is   constantly   playing   with   the   beads .   the   length   is   nice ,   it   s   not   too   short   or   too   long ,   and   the   clip   is   very   durable .   we   use   this   as   my   son   s   going   out   bink   link   and   we   have   gotten   tons   of   comments   on   it ! ! !
love   em !   my   babe   loves   these   pacifiers   anyway ...   but   one   day   my   husband   says ,   someone   should   invent   glow   in   the   dark   pacifiers   presto !   amazon   finds   it !
adorable !   i   bought   this   because   it   looked   so   cute   online   and   when   we   received   it ,   it   looked   even   cuter   in   person !   i   love   it   so   much   and   can   t   wait   for   our   daughter   to   arrive   in   may   so   she   can   give   it   a   try .   the   quality   is   impressive   and   much   better   than   most   other   pacifiers   i   have   seen .   plus   you   have   to   admit   that   it   is   so   much   cuter   than   anything   you   can   buy   at   walmart ... which   is   all   we   have   around   here .   i   know   no   other   mothers   here   will   have   this   pacifier   which   keeps   pacifiers   from   getting   mixed   up   with   other   babies .   i   recommend   it   and   other   pacifiers   made   by   personalized   pacifiers !   also ,   if   you   go   to   their   website ,   you   can   special   order   one   with   your   babies   name   on   it .  
better   ones   out   there   these   pacifier   attachers   are   ok ... but   there   are   better   ones   out   there .   my   son   never   used   a   pacifier   so   we   have   these   to   help   keep   his   toys   attached   to   the   car   seat ,   high   chair   or   stroller .   the   end   that   grabs   the   toy   pacifier   works   great   good   length   ,   but   the   clip   end   is   very   large .   it   is   fairly   easy   to   operate   so   my   son   is   able   to   take   it   off   already   by   himself   10   months   old   .   i   can   t   imagine   we   will   be   able   to   use   them   for   very   long .
my   baby   s   favorite   pacifiers   i   have   a   few   pairs   of   these   and   they   work   great .   i   don   t   just   use   them   for   nighttime ...   i   use   them   all   day   long .   the   good   thing   is   that   avent   pacifiers   can   be   found   anywhere ...   so   just   in   case   you   lose   it   you   can   pick   up   another   quickly .   br   br   the   only   thing   i   didn   t   care   for   is   that   you   have   no   control   on   what   color   is   sent   to   you .   the   description   states   clearly   that   colors   are   random   packaged .   luckily   for   me   i   received   the   blue   set   for   my   son .
wubbanub   love !   my   3   month   old   prefers   to   suck   on   her   fist   than   a   pacifier   probably   because   they   fall   out   so   easily   and   she   doesn   t   have   the   motor   skills   to   put   them   back   in ,   yet .   but   with   the   wubbanub   she   is   able   to   maneuver   it   with   her   arm   fist   so   that   if   the   paci   part   comes   out   she   can   push   it   back   up   towards   her   mouth .   we   got   this   yesterday   and   she   took   to   it   immediately !   she   seems   to   love   grasping   at   it   while   she   is   sucking   and   she   is   sucking   at   it   like   a   champ .   finally   we   re   able   to   soothe   her   so   easily .   plus   it   s   darn   cute ,   too !
very   cute   for   baby   i   ordered   this   for   my   son ,   who   is   due   via   c   section   on   the   15th ,   with   buying   something   in   mind   that   would   be   both   soothing   and   a   good   thing   for   my   baby   as   he   gets   older .   its   a   little   smaller   then   i   thought   it   would   be   and   really   the   only   bummer   for   me   is   that   you   don   t   have   the   option   of   switching   out   the   pacifier ,   but   these   don   t   take   away   from   the   quality   and   the   usefulness   of   the   wubbie !   br   br   the   soothie   pacifier   is   the   same   that   my   mom ,   a   l   d   nurse   .   uses   at   her   and   most   other   hospitals .   i   m   confident   that   we   will   get   plenty   of   use   of   out   this !
son   didn   t   like   this   paci   i   ve   used   another   brand   and   this   one   doesn   t   stay   in   baby   s   mouth ,   it   goes   flying   out   of   his   lips   all   too   often   and   the   base   is   just   not   shaped   to   baby   s   face .   he   prefers   the   other   brand   much   better .

lifesaver   ...   prefect   for   breastfed   babies !   i   was   hesitant   to   give   my   newborn   a   pacifier   at   all ,   but   around   4   weeks ,   she   became   insistant   that   she   have   something   to   suck   on   as   she   fell   asleep .   i   was   nursing   her   to   sleep ,   but   it   came   to   point   that   after   i   d   try   to   slip   away   she   d   immediately   wake   up   rooting   for   something   to   suck .   br   br   i   bought   several   asin   b004iohn8q   the   first   years   2   pack   gumdrop   infant   pacifier ,   pink   purple   soothies   ,   but   she   was   never   happy   with   them .   when   i   tried   to   slip   the   pacifier   in   place   of   my   breast   after   she   was   asleep ,   she   d   immediately   stir   fuss .   br   br   i   bought   the   natursutten   pacifier   because   i   loved   that   it   s   all   natural ,   bpa   pvc   phthalates   free !   i   was   skeptical   that   my   little   girl   would   take   any   brand ,   but   this   one   has   worked   wonders .   the   pacifier   is   large   enough   that   it   rests   against   her   nose   just   like   my   breast .   i   m   able   to   slip   away   after   she   s   done   nursing   slip   in   this   pacifier   without   a   problem .   br   br   i   should   note   that   my   little   girl   has   had   trouble   figuring   out   how   to   suck   a   pacifier   but   this   one   she   took   to   very   quickly .   we   are   both   very   happy !
looks   nothing   like   the   picture   the   reason   i   bought   the   wubbanub   is   because   of   how   much   my   daughter   loved   them .   the   wubbanub   itself   is   amazing .   i   am   very   let   down   with   the   description   by   picture .   the   main   giraffe   picture   is   not   what   you   will   receive .   it   is   completely   different   and   not   even   half   as   cute .   it   might   be   the   pregnancy   hormones ,   but   i   am   pretty   disappointed   with   it  
works   great   we   have   this   case   attached   to   the   diaper   bag ,   and   then   just   put   a   pacifier   in   it   as   we   leave   the   house .   we   use   the   soothie   pacifiers   and   they   fit   in   fine ,   sometime   a   little   crammed ,   but   it   works .   plus ,   it   s   very   easy   to   clean ,   and   dries   out   quickly .   we   re   on   our   second   one ,   first   one   broke   after   a   year   or   so .   tried   a   different   case   after ,   but   didn   t   like   it   nearly   as   well .   only   could   find   this   replacement   one   on   amazon .
not   a   fan   seems   like   everyone   has   one   of   these   so   i   got   one   for   my   son   at   4   months .   he   would   never   keep   it   centered   in   his   mouth   and   would   often   let   it   slide   out   to   the   corners   of   his   mouth .   it   didn   t   seem   to   fit   well   at   all .   after   a   week   or   two ,   i   went   back   to   the   nuk   paci   and   that   is   what   he   prefers .   even   though   he   gets   binky   marks   from   it ,   at   least   it   seems   more   comfortable   and   he   keeps   it   in .
love   these   pacifiers !   we   had   these   for   our   little   guy   and   loved   them !   we   had   a   pack   of   green   blue   and   the   colours   were   great   and   always   seemed   to   match   his   outfit   also   we   loved   the   clear   part ,   i   really   don   t   like   some   of   the   other   soothers   that   make   it   look   like   the   baby   has   a   huge   thing   hanging   out   of   his   mouth .   these   are   nice   and   discreet   and   lasted   us   0   6mths .   then   once   he   started   crawling   we   lost   them   and   since   then   have   lost   more   than   15 ...   will   buy   more   for   the   next   little   guy !
hilarious ,   useful   baby   gift !   this   is   a   really   funny ,   yet   still   practical   gift   for   parents .   i   bought   it   as   a   gift   for   my   sister .   love   it !
he   loves   these !   the   0   3   month   soothies   are   the   only   pacifier   our   little   connoisseur   will   use .   br   br   i   love   that   they   are   a   simple   design ,   no   chance   for   water   or   moisture   to   get   caught   inside   the   nipple   in   the   dishwasher .   i   regularly   run   these   through   with   our   dishes   and   they   come   out   perfect .   br   br   the   only   caveat   is   that   they   aren   t   compatible   with   most   of   the   paci   clips   you   can   find   commercially ,   i   had   to   come   online   to   find   a   paci   grip   with   a   rope   attachment   on   it .   br   br   i   wish   they   made   them   in   more   colors !   getting   tired   of   the   green   ones   everywhere   in   my   house   would   love   orange   maybe  
great   for   any   fan !   if   you   love   your   team   as   much   as   i   love   the   cubs ,   then   you   will   get   this   for   your   baby .   so   they   can   grow   up   loving   the   same   team   you   do !
very   cheap !   breakable !   this   item   came   it   was   really   cheezy   and   cheap .   the   handle   for   the   top   might   just   break   right   off .   not   worth   5.00   when   i   can   pay   2   for   a   really   good   one .   also   the   zebra   design   is   very   light   grey ..   you   can   hardly   see   it .
just   ok   just   in   case   you   think   they   are ,   these   bags   are   not   zipper   bags .   they   are   pull   strings .   they   seem   like   they   will   work   but   they   are   poorly   made .   the   insides   of   them   are   already   coming   apart   and   they   ve   never   been   used   yet .
baby   loves   it ,   but   not   optimal   quality   my   daughter   has   had   the   dog   version   of   this   for   a   while .   she   loves   it ,   but   she   is   now   obsessed   with   cats .   i   ordered   this   one   for   her   crib .   she   loves   it ,   but   within   a   week   or   so ,   the   cat   s   nose   has   come   unstitched .   not   the   quality   i   was   expecting .   i   didn   t   think   i   would   have   to   be   sewing   it   so   soon .
well   made ,   but   had   some   issues   this   pacifier   is   nicely   made   and   easy   to   clean ,   being   all   one   piece   of   rubber ,   but   my   son   prefers   teh   nuk   brand   pacifiers .   br   br   we   were   given   this   brand   at   teh   hospital ,   so   we   assumed   it   was   a   great   pacifier   to   use ,   but   my   son   just   never   latched   on   to   it .   i   believe   the   shape   of   the   nipple ,   and   the   thickness   of   the   rubber   make   it   too   hard   for   him   to   grip   with   his   lips .   br   br   also ,   i   wasnt   really   a   fan   of   the   part   you   are   supposed   to   grab   it   from .   the   little   tab   just   isn   t   easy   or   comfortable   to   hold ,   especially   when   trying   to   wiggle   it   in   an   unhappy   baby   s   mouth .
love   the   colors !   so   happy   with   this   wabanub !   the   colors   are   great   and   it   s   so   soft .   baby   hasn   t   come   yet ,   but   that   didn   t   stop   me   from   playing   with   it   on   my   38   week   belly   and   describing   it   to   the   baby .   my   husband   thought   i   was   crazy ,   but   i   was   seriously   excited   about   how   cute   this   turned   out   to   be !
very   cute   i   love   this   pacifier .   only   reason   i   didn   t   give   it   5   stars   is   because   i   was   expecting   better   packaging   for   something   that   is   new .   if   it   were   in   more   secure   packaging   5   stars   would   of   been   given .   the   pacifier   is   of   great   quality   and   will   be   the   perfect   accent   to   most   of   my   daughters   outfits .
not   worth   the   money   i   thought   my   daughter   would   love   this   and   it   would   be   great   for   night   time .   i   don   t   think   she   has   used   it   once ,   she   want   s   nothing   to   do   with   it .   it   would   be   better   if   you   could   change   the   pacifier   out   on   it .
great   i   love   these   it   allows   us   to   easily   clean   off   pacifiers   and   teethers !   smells   really   good   too !   they   are   great   because   what   is   not   always   available .
great   everything !   this   product   was   well   priced ,   shipped   extremely   fast   and   i   would   definitely   recommend   it   to   anyone .   i   can   t   wait   to   see   it   in   action !
zebra   rocks !   we   got   the   monkey   loved   him   so   much   we   just   had   to   add   the   zebra   to   the   mix !   zaire   the   zebra   is   very   soft ,   rocks   a   mohawk ,   contrasting   colors   are   very   stimulating   and   she   is   the   perfect   size   shape   for   a   young   baby   to   grab   my   little   girl   is   just   12   weeks   old   and   the   paci   seems   too   hard   in   density   for   her   to   suck   but   she   loves   to   chew   on   it !
best   pacifiers   ever !   my   son   loves   these .   one   of   my   cannot   live   without   baby   items   for   sure .   they   are   round ,   like   a   real   nipple ,   instead   of   flat ,   and   you   can   put   your   finger   inside   the   nipple ,   so   they   really   feel   like   they   are   sucking   on   something .
baby   loves   them   baby   loves   them   and   mom   does   to .   they   wash   well   in   the   dishwasher .   they   also   stand   up   to   the   baby   chowing   on   them
too   cute   i   did   get   the   product   i   ordered   so   i   can   only   assume   the   people   that   didn   t   ordered   from   a   different   vender   or   got   confused   and   ordered   the   wrong   product .   that   being   said ,   this   thing   is   sold   as   a   novelty   and   for   the   reason   i   took   that   into   consideration   during   my   review .   this   thing   is   too   cute ,   the   nipple   is   too   large   for   a   new   born   but   should   be   usable   after   about   6   9   months .   there   is   no   ring   or   ledge   for   removal   from   a   baby   s   mouth   or   to   attach   a   pacy   clip   to .   this   shouldn   t   be   a   big   deal   because   this   should   probably   only   be   used   under   close   supervision   due   to   the   nipple   size ,   weight   and   materials   used .   let   s   face   it ,   though   it   can   be   used   by   a   child   it   doesn   t   look   like   usability   was   the   main   goal   when   making   this .   laughter   was .   it   s   built   well   and   will   work .   if   your   baby   doesn   t   like   the   nipple   on   the   pacy   try   pulling   the   face   off   of   this   pacy   can   gluing   it   onto   another   one .
the   cutest   thing   i   recieved   the   item   fast   and   as   decribed , my   daughter   loves   it , since   she   was   born   shes   been   all   about   monkeys   and   this   was   perfect   for   her .   thanks   so   much   for   a   great   service   and   a   perfect   toy .
lol   everyone   who   sees   my   2   yr   old   daughter   with   this   thinks   it   s   cute   and   funny .   my   daughter   even   looks   in   the   mirror   and   laughs .   she   loves   it   n   so   do   i ,   perfect   fit   for   her .   the   pacifier   is   not   heavy   at   all .
this   dragon   is   so   cute !   i   love   the   way   this   little   dragon   looks ,   and   it   s   always   easy   to   find   the   baby   s   pacifier .   however ,   i   do   not   feel   that   it   helps   our   little   guy   keep   the   pacifier   in   his   mouth   at   all .   he   s   only   2   months   old   and   was   a   preemie ,   so   he   has   difficulty   holding   onto   a   paci   regardless .   the   soothie   and   gumdrop   pacifiers   are   the   only   ones   recommended   by   lactation   professionals   for   nursing   babies ,   so   i   feel   like   if   you   have   to   use   one   of   the   soothies ,   why   not   have   a   cute   one   to   wash   the   dragon ,   i   ve   just   used   a   damp   cloth   with   some   dish   detergent   and   let   him   air   dry .   it   has   worn   just   fine   cleaning   him   with   this   method .   just   a   reminder ,   the   soothie   is   stitched   to   the   dragon ,   so   you   cannot   change   out   the   pacifier ,   unless   you   feel   comfortable   sewing   and   are   crafty .   i   feel   like   for   the   money   the   dragon   costs ,   i   d   be   too   afraid   to   botch   the   job !   overall ,   i   think   it   s   an   adorable   novelty ,   but   not   incredibly   useful .   we   just   appreciate   it   for   being   cute   and   the   baby   looks   sweet   with   the   little   dragon   laying   on   his   chest ,   it   looks   like   they   re   kissing .
0   6month   pacifiers   my   daughter   loves   these   pacifiers   and   it   s   the   only   kind   she   ll   take .   my   son   used   to   love   avent   pacifiers   too .   however ,   i   m   alittle   disappointed   i   couldn   t   choose   what   design   i   wanted .   i   really   wanted   the   cat   and   lamb   ones   since   we   have   cats   and   her   nursery   is   lamb   themed   but   we   got   the   cow   and   rabbit   ones .   therefore ,   i   only   gave   these   4   stars .
ok   but   not   for   us !   i   bought   this   by   reading   the   reviews   and   also   read   about   it   in   a   baby   magazine   that   it   s   suppose   to   be   very   natural   and   good   but   when   we   got   it   i   gave   it   my   sin   who   is   6   months   he   hated   it   maybe   the   nipple   shape   but   he   s   so   use   to   playtex   binkey   and   also   it   s   very   light   weight   it   keeps   calling   of   from   his   mouth   and   he   got   angry   when   i   gave   him   this   i   just   have   it   under   his   pillow   in   his   crib   he   hardly   uses   it   i   love   nuk   pacifiers   more   this   is   ok   and   a   bit   pricey   since   my   kid   next   uses   it   i   was   a   waste   of   9   ps   it   catches   a   lot   of   lint
best   for   breastfed   babes   this   pacifier   isn   t   an   orthodontic   pacifier ,   but   that   is   the   biggest   positive   in   my   opinion .   a   newborn   doesn   t   need   an   orthodontic   pacifier ,   a   newborn   needs   what   is   going   to   be   the   most   comforting ,   and   the   soothie   is   the   most   nipple   like   pacifier   there   is .   if   you   are   a   breastfeeding   mother ,   and   you   decide   to   use   a   pacifier ,   please   be   sure   to   use   the   soothie .   the   soothie   will   definitely   help   you   avoid   any   nipple   confusion   that   might   occur   from   using   an   orthodontic   or   other   odd   shaped   pacifier .   i   love   the   soothie ,   and   my   son   used   one   until   we   gave   up   pacifiers   all   together .   i   plan   to   use   a   soothie   with   my   daughter   expected   in   a   couple   months   ,   and   i   know   i   will   not   be   disappointed .
wubbanub   mothers   and   babies   love   them   there   are   many   animals   to   choose   from .   enough   to   match   any   baby   s   decor   no   matter   what
cuuuutttteeee !   i   bought   this   as   a   little   treat   for   my   daughter ,   who   is   due   in   june ,   i   m   sure   she   will   love   it .   this   item   is   just   as   cute   in   person   as   on   the   web .   at   first   i   thought   it   was   smaller   than   anticipated ,   but   that   has   more   to   do   with   me   skipping   over   the   measurement   description   than   any   real   issue .   br   my   husband   is   excited   too ,   who   doesn   t   love   dragons  
great   design !   our   brian   loves   this   pacifier !   he   holds   on   to   it   for   dear   life ,   and   just   loves   the   little   monkey .   this   is   one   clever   design ,   and   it   s   the   second   one   we   ve   purchased   in   this   series .   i   guarantee   we   ll   be   back   for   more ,   because   the   baby   just   loves   it   so   much .
another   great   wunnanub   have   4   month   old   twins   and   wubbanub   s   are   all   our   babies   have   ever   had .   we   currently   have   8   different   ones .   4   for   our   daughter   and   4   for   our   son ! ! ! !   i   m   sure   we   will   buy   more .   these   are   great ! ! ! !
so   awesome   i   purchased   this   as   a   christmas   gift   and   it   made   the   entire   day !   we   all   couldn   t   stop   laughing   when   the   baby   put   it   in   his   mouth !   definitely   makes   for   great   pictures   on   facebook   and   chuckles ! ! !
love   these ...   and   so   does   my   son !   we   got   our   soothie   2   pack   today ,   while   my   son   was   napping .   i   gave   him   one   as   he   was   getting   ready   to   head   down   for   his   next   nap .   it   took   a   little   work   to   get   him   to   hang   onto   it ,   as   he   s   been   used   to   more   traditionally   shaped   pacifiers   he   s   11   weeks   old   ,   but   he   caught   on   fairly   fast ,   and   the   next   time   he   went   to   nurse   i   noticed   that   he   was   taking   a   deeper   latch   already !   i   had   some   supply   problems   early   on ,   so   anything   that   encourages   good   latching   and   better   milk   transfer   is   okay   by   me .   i   ve   noticed   some   reviews   criticizing   this   pacifier   for   being   a   potential   choking   hazard .   let   me   say   that   there   is   a   degree   of   personal   responsibility   here .   these   are   not   the   hard   plastic   pacifiers   most   people   are   used   to ...   they   are   medical   grade   silicone ,   made   for   newborns .   the   whole   thing   is   softer ,   more   flexible ,   and   yes ,   that   means   that   you   have   to   watch   your   baby   to   make   sure   he   can   t   fit   the   whole   thing   into   his   mouth ,   because   babies   try   that .   on   the   wrapper   it   says   not   to   leave   your   baby   alone   with   a   pacifier   any   pacifier   ,   and   i   imagine   that   it   s   for   precisely   this   reason .   if   your   child   can   fit   the   whole   soothie   into   his   her   mouth ,   it   s   too   small   and   you   need   to   buy   a   binky   that   is   appropriately   sized   for   your   child .   as   for   the   suckerfish   look ...   i   think   it   s   hilariously   cute .   update   2   19   12   still   loving   the   soothie ,   still   refusing   any   and   all   other   binkies .   longer   review   on   my   blog   ...  
unpractical   the   giraffe   it   s   attache   to   the   pacifier ,   so   every   single   time   that   you   want   it   to   wash   and   sterilize   the   pacifier   which   must   be   a   lot   if   you   are   a   clean   person   you   re   a   gonna   have   a   wet   giraffe ,   even   when   you   clean   the   pacifier   carefully ...   super   unpractical
baby   loves   dino   my   little   girl   loves   this   toy ,   and   she   doesn   t   even   really   go   for   pacifiers   usually .   i   love   how   dino   is   easily   grasped   and   she   hasn   t   lost   him   yet   she   s   7   months   old   now   !   she   likes   to   chew   suck   on   the   pacifier   itself ,   the   sides   of   the   pacifier ,   and   dino   s   nose ,   hands   and   feet .   as   for   cleaning ,   the   tag   says   not   to   machine   wash   or   submerse ,   but   i   usually   just   use   a   little   soap   and   suds   him   up   by   hand ,   let   him   dry   overnight .   dino   seems   no   worse   for   the   wear .
great   product   if   my   daughter   took   pacifiers   this   pacifier   simulates   like   advertised   and   everything .   and   its   the   closest   looking   nipple   to   me ,   as   i   strictly   breastfeed .   ive   tried   several   pacifiers   for   her   but   she   just   wont   have   it .   but   to   a   breastfed   baby   who   likes   pacifiers   but   is   picky ,   this   would   be   great   i   think .
no   my   favorite   i   personally   wouldn   t   purchase   these   again .   they   are   very   cute ,   but   not   as   practical   as   some   of   the   other   kinds   other   avent   kinds   included   .   my   little   girl   likes   to   turn   the   bink   around   in   her   mouth ,   but   with   this   kind   only   one   side   is   up .   they   are   also   more   bulky   and   she   s   only   10   months   old   and   still   seem   too   big   for   me .   br   br   overall   love   the   avent   brand   though .   i   own   binks ,   bottles ,   and   sippy   cups .
my   son   loves   this !   these   are   so   well   made   and   my   son   loves   it .   the   only   problem   is   that   they   are   like   crack   for   your   kids .   my   son   will   not   use   any   other   pacifier   now   that   he   has   wubbanub .   if   it   goes   missing   its   an   all   apb   to   find   it   or   he   won   t   go   to   sleep .   so   he   has   one   and   we   have   2   on   reserve .
love   it   this   produst   met   my   expectations .   it   was   used   for   a   gift   for   my   friends   babyshower   and   she   loved   it .   the   sparkles   are   so   cute   i   would   recommend   this .   and   will   be   buying   this   again   for   another   babyshower .
love   it ! ! !   my   daughter   loves   her   monk   monk   ! !   he   goes   everywhere   with   us !   it   really   helps   that   she   can   hold   onto   it   and   play   with   the   stuffed   animal   while   she   s   pacify   ing .   it   is   also   more   convenient   for   me   to   find   monk   monk   in   her   diaper   bag ,   all   the   other   pacifiers   fall   to   the   bottom   and   i   constantly   have   to   dig   to   find   them .   you   should   definitely   get   one !
great   for   small   babies   these   pacifiers   are   great ,   especially   for   little   babies .   our   son   didn   t   quite   have   the   ability   to   keep   a   pacifier   in   his   mouth   for   any   real   length   of   time   until   he   was   several   months   old .   if   you   put   this   pacifier   in   his   mouth   with   the   animal   on   his   stomach ,   the   pacifier   won   t   fall   out   if   baby   loses   suction   for   a   second .   it   keeps   me   from   putting   the   pacifier   back   in   his   mouth   every   few   seconds   and   has   taught   him   how   to   keep   the   pacifier   in   his   mouth .   we   tried   pacifiers   without   a   stuffed   animal   attached ,   but   they   fell   out   of   his   mouth   almost   immediately   when   he   was   just   a   few   months   old .   we   also   tried   pacimals   when   he   was   small ,   but   the   angle   is   all   wrong   for   a   newborn .
the   best   pacifier   this   is   the   best   pacifier   on   the   market .   this   is   the   type   that   they   gave   us   in   the   hospital   and   my   daughter   won   t   use   anything   else .   we   had   other   one   s   around   but   she   always   grabs   this   one .   it   s   nice   also   that   it   comes   in   other   colors   other   than   green .   we   really   love   them .
like   the   bull   he   was   smaller   than   i   expected   but   he   will   still   work   for   his   purpose   and   still   is   something   for   the   little   one   to   hang   on   to .
baby   likes   it   but   they   fall   out   really   easily   i   got   these   because   my   baby   just   would   not   take   the   flat   teat   style   ones   that   are   so   common   nowadays .   i   live   in   singapore   and   it   took   a   while   for   the   package   to   reach   me   and   in   the   interim   managed   to   find   a   more   traditional   style   pacifier   from   pidgeon   but   with   an   olive   shaped   teat .   it   s   possible   i   would   think   more   highly   of   the   soothie   if   i   had   not   tried   the   pigeon   pacifier   first .   my   baby   will   take   the   soothie   but   does   not   prefer   it   over   the   pigeon   one .   the   problem   with   the   soothie   is   that   it   falls   out   of   his   mouth   really   easy .   if   he   lets   up   sucking   for   a   moment   it   falls   out   of   his   mouth .   if   it   happens   to   roll   out   of   his   cot   which   seems   to   happen   more   frequently   than   a   regular   pacifier   it   always   lands   teat   side   down   regular   pacifiers   are   more   likely   to   land   teat   side   up   .   additionally   there   is   no   cover   for   the   soothie   and   it   is   more   difficult   to   teather   to   a   stroller   or   car   seat   so   it   is   not   a   great   pacifier   to   travel   with .   in   short   i   will   use   the   soothies   as   back   ups   as   baby   will   take   them   but   will   not   be   buying   more   as   a   regular   pacifier   with   an   olive   shaped   teat   is   better

cutest   paci !   i   ordered   some   pacifiers   from   personalized   pacifiers   online   and   they   are   the   only   ones   my   daughter   will   take   now .   we   needed   a   few   extras   to   have   in   the   diaper   bag ,   car   and   bed   so   we   ordered   this   one   and   a   couple   others .   i   love   this   paci ,   we   get   so   many   compliments   on   it   that   i   m   going   to   order   another   one   as   a   back   up .   we   ve   even   sterilized   it   and   the   zebra   print   didn   t   fade   or   wash   off   at   all !

best   pacifier   my   14   months   old   baby   boy   loves   mam   latex   pacifiers ,   when   i   wanted   to   buy   new   ones   i   came   across   these ,   and   were   glad   i   did   he   absolutely   loves   them ,   there   very   easy   to   clean   water   doesn   t   get   trapped   in   .   br   then   two   weeks   later   he   bit   through   them   i   bought   4   ,   the   other   latex   ones   survived   8   months   with   no   damage .   br   maybe   they   are   just   too   thin   i   don   t   know   but   what   a   waste   of   money !
our   baby   never   drops   these   we   were   running   low   on   pacifiers ,   so   decided   to   try   out   a   new   style .   our   daughter   is   4   months   old ,   and   she   is   hooked   on   these .   unlike   the   other   ones   we   ve   used   soothies   ,   she   never   spits   this   one   out ,   even   when   we   pick   her   up   or   carry   her .   it   also   seems   that   the   design   gives   her   more   freedom   to   breathe   than   other   pacifiers .   whatever   it   is ,   she   loves   these !
cute   and   comfortable   this   pacifier   lasts   for   very   long ,   has   great   sweet   designs   that   varies   a   lot ,   and   has   the   air   circulation   holes   in   middle   which   we   appreciate ..   my   son   literaly   throws   any   different   pacifier   i   try   to   give   im   at   me ..  
giraffe   wubanub   why   didn   t   i   think   of   this   my   daughter   loves   her   giraffe .   we   have   the   duck   and   the   puppy   dog   and   decided   to   get   her   the   giraffe   since   it   was   so   cute .   the   duck   and   giraffe   are   nice   and   thin   and   light ,   making   it   easier   for   her   to   hold   and   not   fall   out   of   her   mouth   because   of   the   weight .   the   puppy   is   really   bulky   and   heavy   and   we   had   a   hard   time   keeping   up   with   it .   she   loves   to   play   with   the   ears   of   the   giraffe   as   well .   it   s   great   becuase   the   pacifers   alone   are   rubber   and   bounce   when   they   hit   the   ground .   attached   to   the   stuffed   animal ,   we   haven   t   had   to   get   down   on   our   hands   and   knees   looking   for   it .   it   s   great !
great   gag   gift   i   gave   this   as   a   gift   to   a   friend   who   is   expecting   a   new   baby .   as   self   proclaimed   rednecks ,   they   loved   it ,   and   the   pacifier   was   a   big   hit   at   her   baby   shower .   i   don   t   know   how   good   it   is   for   use   as   an   everyday   pacifier ,   but   for   photo   ops   and   family   parties ,   i   m   sure   it   will   be   great   and   get   a   lot   of   laughs .   if   you   want   to   make   someone   smile ,   then   go   ahead   and   purchase !
wubbanub   it   works   great   our   daughter   uses   it   all   the   time .   it   was   recommended   by   a   friend   of   ours   so   we   tried   it   and   its   a   good   thing   we   did   its   pretty   cool .
love   these   love   these   pacifiers ,   after   my   friends   seen   them   they   all   wanted   them   too .   i   like   that   they   dont   go   the   whole   way   up   to   the   babies   nose   like   the   ones   from   the   hospital ,   and   thier   much   softer .   as   for   the   vanilla   scent   it   wears   off   quickly .
cute !   we   waiting   for   our   baby   to   be   born   in   april .   cant   wait   for   her   to   try   this   pacifier .   its   cute   looking   especially   it   says   daddys   girl  
battery   life   as   with   almost   all   of   the   other   reviews ,   which   i   basically   ignored ,   the   battery   life   does   not   last .   we   bought   this   to   take   on   an   international   trip   so   that   we   would   not   be   constantly   worrying   about   dirty   pacifiers   on   the   plane   and   in   the   airport .   we   did   not   even   make   it   from   the   states   to   europe   without   the   batteries   dying .   and   we   put   fresh   batteries   the   day   we   left .   better   to   buy   pacifier   wipes .
cool   i   love   these !   im   so   glad   i   got   the   blue   ones   too .   it   said   color   may   vary   and   i   was   worried   i   would   end   up   with   a   girl   color .   i   have   other   pacifiers   i   received   as   gifts   but   so   far   i   think   these   are   the   best .   its   so   cool   they   glow   in   the   dark .
newborn   would   not   take   it   was   very   happy   to   purchase   an   all   natural   pacifier ,   however   my   daughter   who   is   ebf   and   loves   to   suck   would   not   take   it   after   multiple   attempts   throughout   her   first   month .   i   think   it   has   to   do   with   the   nipple   size   ...   i   don   t   see   how   it   could   replicate   a   mothers   nipple   which   touches   the   roof   of   babies   mouth .   this   nipple   just   seems   too   small   for   my   baby   to   suck   the   same   way   she   would   as   if   she   was   breastfeeding .   really   sad   this   product   didn   t   work   out   because   i   was   excited   to   try   it .   i   would   suggest   new   moms   give   it   a   try   though ,   because   if   you   re   going   to   introduce   a   pacifier ,   you   might   as   well   make   sure   it   s   natural !
my   daughter   loves   it !   since   her   birth   my   daughter   only   takes   a   soothie   binkie .   i   had   gotten   her   a   clip   for   her   binkie ,   but   i   wanted   something   better   than   that .   i   asked   my   friend   in   my   breastfeeding   support   group   where   she   got   hers   and   she   told   me   the   website   on   the   binkie .   i   came   to   amazon . com   upon   learning   the   name   of   them   and   i   found   a   ton   more   than   the   duck   and   red   puppy .   i   let   my   oldest   daughter   pick   out   my   youngest   daughters   wubbanub   and   she   found   this .   i   love   how   soft   the   elephant   is .   i   was   also   very   happy   that   for   the   first   time   in   her   two   months   of   being   on   earth   she   decided   she   didn   t   need   the   vanilla   scent   of   her   soothies   from   the   hospital .   we   will   now   be   ordering   her   the   red   dragon ,   as   that   was   the   one   my   husband   wanted   to   get   her .   i   only   gave   it   a   4   out   of   5   stars   because   of   the   way   it   has   to   be   cleaned ,   and   the   binkies   are   not   interchangeable   if   the   soothie   gets   worn   down .   at   about   13   20   dollars   a   pop ,   i   would   think   they   would   find   a   safe   way   to   make   the   binkies   interchangeable .
poor   quality   we   used   this   for   about   1   month ... it   would   not   stay   snapped   to   our   diaper   bag   so   we   had   to   store   it   inside   the   bag .   then   the   zipper   broke !   so   now   i   am   going   to   buy   a   different   brand   to   replace   it .   not   happy   with   the   quality .   could   barely   fit   2   nuk   pacifiers   in   it .
amazing !   i   love   this   pacifier   compared   to   the   other   version   which   i   love   to .   i   love   this   one   because   when   my   daughter   sleeps   with   it   in   her   mouth   when   she   s   on   her   stomach   it   is   flat   but   when   i   want   to   attach   it   to   a   cord   so   it   doesn   t   end   up   everywhere   when   we   are   out   it   also   has   that   capability !   i   couldn   t   say   anything   more   that   would   make   this   item   more   perfect !   great   job   nuk ! !
great   buy !   the   sound   it   makes   resemble   more   a   truck   passing   by   than   in   uterus   sound   but   the   battery   lasts   for   ever   and   my   little   man   seems   to   enjoy   it   anyway !

soothie   pacifier   these   are   awesome !   i   used   the   blue   green   ones   with   my   son   just   ordered   the   pink   purple   set   for   my   daughter   that   is   due   in   a   few   months

didn   t   work   for   us   i   ve   heard   a   few   people   swear   by   these   things ,   so   obviously   they   work   well   for   lots   of   kids .   my   baby   though   would   gag   whenever   she   got   the   nipple   into   her   mouth .   not   really   sure   why ...   but   she   never   had   soothies   in   the   hospital   or   anything   and   prefers   the   avent   pacifiers   with   the   wider ,   flatter   nipple .   also ,   like   many   others   have   noted ,   it   would   have   been   nice   if   it   could   be   sterilized .   i   held   the   monkey   over   a   pot   of   boiling   water ,   being   careful   not   to   get   the   nose   of   the   monkey   too   wet   while   the   pacifier   boiled .   not   sure   how   well   it   worked ,   but   better   than   nothing !   the   monkey   could   ve   been   a   bit   heavier   too ,   as   it   often   fell   off   of   my   baby .   she   s   4   months ,   so   this   would   work   way   better   for   a   kid   still   being   swaddled .  
works   with   gumdrop   pacifiers !   i   was   hesitant   to   buy   this   at   first   because   we   only   use   the   gumdrop   pacifiers   and   i   didn   t   see   how   i   could   attach   those   to   the   bear .   it   took   some   effort   but   i   was   able   to   do   it   see   the   pictures   i   uploaded   in   the   product   images   .   br   br   the   directions   i   got   with   the   bear   state   that   it   can   be   tossed   in   the   washing   machine   pacifier   and   all   but   i   have   not   done   that .   it   s   a   personal   preference ,   just   not   sure   how   safe   it   is   to   get   laundry   detergent   on   a   pacifier ,   even   if   it   s   rinsed .   so   i   wash   the   pacifier   by   hand   with   hot   water   and   replace   it   when   necessary .   br   br   when   i   first   bought   this   my   baby   then   8   months   did   not   like   this   bear   because   it   was   a   bit   heavy   and   it   kept   pulling   the   pacifier   out   of   her   mouth .   within   a   few   days ,   though ,   she   really   got   used   to   it .   before   buying   this ,   i   was   going   nuts   in   the   dark   trying   to   locate   the   pacifier   in   her   crib ,   and   the   fact   that   she   has   designs   on   her   crib   sheets   didn   t   help   matters   because   it   was   easier   to   lose   among   them !   i   purchased   this   bear   to   solve   my   problem ,   and   it   solved   my   baby   s   problem ,   too   when   she   starts   crying   at   night   she   locates   the   bear   easy   enough   to   do ,   even   half   asleep   ,   puts   the   pacifier   in   her   mouth   and   falls   back   asleep   in   no   time .   this   bear   is   a   lifesaver !   br   br   edit   dec   2013   i   recently   had   to   replace   this   for   my   almost   2   year   old   as   she   broke   the   loop .   the   original   one   i   bought   came   in   a   drawstring   bag   with   the   green   pacifier   pictured   as   well   as   a   clear   plastic   flat   pacifier   that   looked   like   a   teether .   now   i   spent   more   money   originally   bought   for   around   11 ,   this   time   bought   for   15   and   the   pacifier   pictured   and   the   teether   pacifier   no   longer   comes   with   it .   they   really   cheaped   out   and   raised   the   price .   i   m   disappointed .   still   a   great   product   but   not   as   pictured !   i   d   give   this   4   stars   now .
cute ! !   i   loved   it   my   niece   looked   so   cute   im   gonna   end   up   buying   more   as   soon   as   i   start   having   my   own   kids   they   look   funny   and   its   a   unique   pacifier ..
absolute   rubbish !   i   bought   this   thing   because   of   all   of   the   reviews   here   and   because   we   were   struggling   with   our   son   s   pacifiers .   he   would   drop   every   single   one   and   the   one   he   liked   he   kept   in   for   only   a   few   minutes .   bottom   line ,   we   realized   he   didn   t   want   it .   that   s   why   he   d   drop   it .   we   took   it   away   at   six   weeks   and   that   was   the   best   thing   we   ever   did .   we   all   slept ,   he   was   happy ,   helped   with   the   breast   feeding   and   made   our   lives   much   easier .   this   pacifier   kept   falling   all   over   the   place ,   he   d   cry   some   more .   then   i   d   try   to   give   it   when   he   was   on   his   side   and   still   fell   off .   no   matter   where   my   son   was   this   wubbanub   didn   t   stay .   furthermore ,   it   was   too   small   and   he   had   a   hard   time   sucking   keeping   it   in .   augh   how   frustrating .   someone   said   oh   noooo   he   needs   to   have   his   sucking   needs   met .   well ,   he   found   his   hands   and   consequently   his   thumb .   not   sure   if   that   is   great   either   but   i   think   it   is   the   natural   way .   yes ,   it   maybe   challenging   to   weaning   of   off   the   thumb ,   but   we   thought   the   paci   would   be   hard   and   it   wasn   t   it .   who   knows !   bottom   line   do   not   waste   your   money   on   this   pacifier   it   doesn   t   comes   close   to   what   they   advertise .
great   quality .   fun   .   i   bought   this   pacifier   for   my   nephew   in   brazil .   my   brother   in   law   is   a   joker   and   i   thought   this   pacifier   would   bring   lots   of   fun .   it   s   a   great   quality   material   and   come   with   instructions   to   sanitize   before   using   it ,   which   i   think   is   very   important .
cool   but   baby   doeesn   t   like   i   love   the   glow   in   the   dark   feature   but   unfortunately   my   7   month   old   baby   does   not   like   the   6   months   nipple   shape   which   is   very   different   from   the   2   months   shape .   i   found   some   mam   glow   in   the   dark   pacifiers   in   the   2   month   version   at   a   local   store   and   she   likes   those .   i   can   finally   find   her   paci   in   the   middle   of   the   night   when   they   otherwise   get   lost   in   the   dark .   when   she   is   crying   in   the   dark   instead   of   feeling   all   around   the   crib   searching   for   them   it   sure   is   handy   to   have   the   soft   glow   to   help   out .   for   those   reviews   that   say   they   don   t   glow   in   the   dark ,   you   actually   need   to   charge   them   up   first   by   exposing   them   to   bright   light   for   a   few   seconds   and   then   they   are   good   for   the   night .
good   pacifiers   it   all   started   at   the   hospital   where   they   gave   us   a   soothie   pacifier .   yes ,   i   know   the   american   academy   of   pediatrics   does   not   recommend   introducing   a   pacifier   until   much   later ,   but   i   requested   it .   anyhow ,   i   only   had   a   vague   idea   about   the   different   shapes   pacifiers   came   in .   my   first   reaction   when   i   saw   the   soothie   was   what   a   weird   shape   this   pacifier   has !   especially   the   part   where   you   re   supposed   to   hold   it .   of   course   the   looks   didn   t   matter   much   to   our   baby .   she   liked   it .   we   tried   the   nuk   orthodontic   pacifier   and   very   soon   it   was   quite   obvious   that   our   daughter   would   only   take   the   soothie   pacifier   so   i   bought   some   more   soothies   and   our   little   girl   likes   them   very   much .   we   ve   used   them   now   for   two   months   and   have   not   run   into   any   issues .
great ,   i   think !   i   really   wish   i   would   ve   tried   these   pacifiers   right   away .   my   daughter   will   only   take   the   nuk   pacifiers .   we   ve   tried   4   other   types   of   pacifiers   and   she   spits   them   out   right   away .   i   really   like   that   these   have   large   air   holes   on   the   side .   give   them   a   try   but   i   d   recommend   early   on .
so   much   easier   to   find   in   the   dark   pacifiers   are   so   easy   to   lose   in   the   nursery   at   night   and   these   have   helped   us   a   lot   to   locate   them   quickly ,   even   if   it   s   dull   glow   after   a   while .   with   others   i   m   constantly   feeling   around   in   the   dark   or   feeling   around   under   the   crib   with   the   mam   glow   in   the   dark   ones   they   usually   retain   enough   glow   for   my   husband   and   i   to   find   them   easily ,   and   now   my   daughter   finds   them   on   her   own   which   means   less   middle   of   the   night   crying   sessions   for   us .   what   more   can   you   ask   for   i   give   them   a   little   extra   charge   by   holding   them   up   to   the   light   for   a   minute ,   which   my   daughter   for   some   reason   finds   hysterically   funny .   other   reviewers   are   correct   in   saying   the   charge   won   t   last   throughout   the   whole   night ,   but   for   us   it   seems   to   be   enough   most   of   the   time .
only   gumdrop   my   daughter   will   take !   ok ,   i   have   waited   quite   some   time   to   write   this   review   but   these   are   the   only   binky   s   my   little   girl   will   take .   it   was   really   bad   when   i   was   traveling   because   i   had   lots   of   extras   which   i   ended   up   losing   .   so ,   i   stopped   on   emergency   to   a   local   store   and   picked   up   the   first   years   comparable   binkys ....   no ,   no ,   no .   she   would   not   take   them .   i   ve   even   tried   several   other   times   since   and   refuses   them .   they   look   a   little   and   feel   different .   anyhow ,   thank   goodness   i   was   traveling   to   my   friend   s   house   who   is   a   nurse   in   labor   and   delivery   and   brought   me   some   to   take   with   me   until   i   could   order   these !   if   your   baby   takes   these   home   from   hospital   and   prefers   them ...   and   is   picky   haha   these   are   the   exact   ones !
love   wubanub   tried   this   one   out   first   before   buying   multiples   for   our   son .   he   loves   it .   so   we   bought   the   giraffe   and   the   puppy   too !
same   as   in   the   hospital   i   have   the   avent   pacifier   with   cap   but   it   slips   all   the   time   when   it   is   in   her   mouth ,   so   i   decided   to   try   this .   same   as   the   one   from   the   hospital .   it   holds   in   the   mouth ,   it   s   just   stiff   a   bit .   could   be   better   if   it   has   a   cap   for   sanitary   purposes .   it   was   just   okay .
not   the   same   as   the   first   years   brand   my   son   looooves   the   soothie   pacifiers .   these ,   however   are   not   the   same   as   the   first   years   brand .   his   one   from   the   hospital   is   still   intact   months   later ,   but   the   advent   ones   cracked   in   only   a   couple   weeks !   i   heard   a   squealing   noise   while   he   was   sucking ,   so   i   took   it   out   of   his   mouth   and   there   were   little   cracks   all   the   way   around   the   nipple   part .   i   pulled   on   it   and   it   started   to   tear .   i   m   so   glad   he   didn   t   choke   on   this !   i   will   not   be   buying   this   brand   again .   save   yourself   some   money   and   the   get   the   real   one   at   toysrus   for   4 .
worth   every   penny ! !   i   first   bought   my   son   the   brown   dog   wubbanub ,   which   he   really   liked ,   so   i   bought   him   this   dino   and   the   lion .   not   only   is   this   dino   wicked   cute ,   my   6   month   old   has   shown   a   preference   to   this   one   over   the   other   two .   yeah   i   wish   there   was   a   way   to   change   out   the   pacifier   part   because   it   s   sewn   in   just   like   every   other   wubbanub   out   there   but   its   very   easy   to   clean ,   i   just   toss   it   in   with   the   clothes   every   time   i   do   a   load   of   my   sons   laundry .   this   was   worth   every   penny   i   spent   on   it !
my   baby   s   favorite   pacifier !   although   a   much   lighter   pink   color   than   pictured ,   the   product   is   great .   really   helps   to   keep   pacifier   in   place   except   when   baby   pulls   on   the   horse !   and   it   makes   it   harder   to   loose   pacifier .   my   only   complaint   is   that   the   thread   for   the   horse   s   nostrils   was   way   to   long   and   hazardous   for   little   fingers ,   so   i   cut   it   out .
adorable   but   paci   is   0   3month   size   my   baby   loves   the   soothie   pacifier   i   love   how   it   holds   the   paci   in   place   even   if   baby   e   lets   go ...   but ,   just   an   fyi   the   paci   is   size   0   3months .   i   just   bought   the   0   6month   size   sewed   it   in .
the   only   ones   my   baby   will   use ! ! ! !   my   third   daughter   would   not   take   a   regular   pacifier !   i   tried   them   all .   then   my   friend   told   me   about   the   vanilla   scented   gubdrop   pacifiers   and   i   tried   them   out .   my   baby   loves   them .   they   are   sort   of   hard   to   find .   you   can   get   them   on   amazon   or   straight   from   the   manufacturer   in   bulk .   i   just   got   mine   from   amazon   its   easier   .   the   review   that   said   they   are   pricey   is   crazy .   i   think   these   ones   are   less   expensive   that   the   traditional   pacifier   you   can   get   at   target ,   and   those   ones   dont   smell   like   vanilla .   the   only   down   side   is   that   they   do   smell   like   vanilla   and   your   dog   may   want   to   eat   it .   mine   doesn   t   but   he   was   interested   at   first .   its   just   a   thought .   great   pacifier !
best   thing   ever !   my   baby   loves   his   paci   and   the   animal   attached   makes   it   so   easy   for   him   to   find   it !   we   will   definitely   buy   another   one   for   our   next   child   ren   .
cute   idea   i   haven   t   seen   these   in   person   yet ,   but   my   son   and   daughter   in   law   both   like   them .   she   even   confirmed   that   the   actual   pacifer   is   the   same   kind   given   to   their   twins   in   the   hospital .   they   appear   to   make   the   pacifer   both   easier   to   stay   put   and   easier   to   find .
excellent   camera ,   great   range   this   product   does   what   it   is   purposed   for .   we   have   been   using   it   for   about   8   months   now   and   haven   t   had   any   problems   with   it .   we   can   easily   see   what   s   going   on   from   a   couple   of   rooms   away   and   in   some   instances   from   over   90   feet .   the   battery   life   isn   t   the   best ,   so   we   have   to   charge   it   everyday   that   s   not   a   big   deal .   also ,   the   microphone   picks   up   sound   amazing   well .   the   camera   rotates ,   is   extremely   easy   to   mount   to   a   wall   and   has   a   1   click   zoom   feature   that   works   nicely .
pure   fun   for   music   lovers   pros   simple   and   fun ,   unique ,   cheap ,   works   as   a   portable   speaker   for   an   mp3   player   cons   not   incredibly   high   quality ,   i   can   see   the   novelty   wearing   off   after   a   while   i   got   this   as   a   gift   for   my   brother   who   loves   music   and   plays   piano   and   a   few   other   instruments .   it   was   great   watching   him   go   from   confusion   to   delight   as   he   figured   out   what   this   thing   was .   a   few   minutes   later   he   was   playing   phantom   of   the   opera   on   it ,   experimenting   with   sliding   the   stylo   vs .   lifting   it ,   laughing   and   saying   it   was   the   best   thing   ever .   even   if   he   gets   tired   of   it   after   a   few   days ,   it   was   worth   20 .
easy   to   use   and   looks   good   i   love   this   stroller .   you   can   change   the   canopy   to   a   different   color   which   is   really   nice .   i   don   t   have   to   by   a   new   stroller   every   time   i   want   to   get   a   different   look .   the   360   degree   spin   feature   is   perfect .   it   makes   strolling   so   much   easier .   i   don   t   have   to   pull   my   baby   out   every   time   i   want   to   see   him .   the   bassinet   is   really   nice   since   you   can   t   use   most   strollers   until   6   months .   you   get   more   use   out   of   this   stroller .   the   look   is   very   pretty .   it   seems   a   little   heavier   but   to   me   it   makes   it   feel   like   it   is   more   durable   than   some   of   the   cheap   other   strollers   out   there .
difficult !   in   theory ,   this   is   a   great   idea .   i   m   not   sure   if   i   got   a   bum   dispenser ,   but   there   is   no   way   to   get   the   bags   out   other   than   cranking   the   bottom   then   pulling   a   few   inches   and   repeating   several   times .   neither   my   husband   nor   i   have   been   able   to   pull   the   bags   out   at   all   without   using   this   method ,   which   always   takes   two   hands .   i   am   better   off   forgetting   about   the   dispenser   and   simply   using   the   rolls   by   themselves .   i   gave   it   2   stars   because   the   bags   have   been   great ,   once   out   of   the   dispenser .   they   have   a   pleasant   odor ,   not   too   strong ,   but   just   enough   to   mask   the   diaper   smell   and   allow   us   to   dispose   of   them   in   the   trash   instead   of   running   outside   to   the   bin   every   diaper   change .   we   are   almost   done   with   the   roll   that   came   with   the   dispenser   and   so   far   no   problems   with   bag   construction .   my   advice   is   to   forget   the   dispenser   and   just   get   the   refill   rolls .   the   roll   is   compact   and   fits   in   a   small   pocket   of   your   diaper   bag ... at   least   better   than   grocery   bags   stuffed   at   the   bottom .
mommy   and   baby   are   happy   with   purchase   we   purchased   this   mobile   on   amazon   after   reading   the   reviews .   i   agree   with   what   some   have   said   as   far   as   the   mobile   keeping   our   little   man   entertained .   he   last   about   twenty   minutes   in   his   crib   with   the   mobile   running .   it   clearly   has   his   full   attention   when   it   s   on   for   him ,   but   then   after   about   twenty   minutes   he   starts   to   cry   signaling   he   is   done   with   it .   keep   in   mind   that   we   just   received   the   mobile   a   few   days   agao ,   but   as   of   now   it   doesn   t   soothe   him   enough   to   be   a   tool   to   help   with   falling   asleep .   overall   good   purchase   and   i   would   recommend   it   to   others .
only   if   it   came   in   another   color   this   is   a   great   item ,   better   than   bjorn   and   looks   better   than   ergobaby .   the   only   problem   is   the   color .. black   or   brown ... i   live   in   southern   california   where   it   is   always   hot .   sometimes   too   hot   to   wear   the   carrier .
we   love   it !   my   wife   bought   this   over   a   year   ago   and   we   have   traveled   many   places   with   it .   it   is   very   easy   to   set   up   and   take   down .   it   s   light   and   easy   to   tote ,   pack   and   travel   with .   our   baby   girl   sleeps   well   in   it .   my   wife   and   i   both   recommend   this   if   you   are   looking   for   a   travel   crib .   we   ve   even   taken   it   to   my   mom   s   house   just   for   our   daughter   to   have   some   place   to   nap .   br   br   the   bottom   line   is   i   can   t   even   think   of   anything   to   complain   about   when   it   comes   to   this   product .
wonderful   carrier !   this   wrap   has   saved   my   life !   as   a   first   time   mom   it   was   difficult   for   me   to   go   shopping ,   do   household   chores   etc   with   a   baby   in   tow .   after   discovering   the   moby   i   am   able   to   travel   by   new   york   city   bus   and   train   with   a   decent   sized   stroller .   sometimes   it   is   so   difficult   to   close   and   open   strollers   while   ensuring   the   baby   s   safety ,   with   the   moby   i   just   put   it   on   under   my   jacket   before   leaving   the   house .   when   i   get   to   the   bus   stop   or   train   station   i   just   place   baby   in   moby   and   ta   dah   my   both   hands   are   free   and   baby   is   safe ! !   get   the   moby ! !
refill   bags   for   diaper   pail   the   refills   are   great .   strong   and   durable .   each   one   holds   up   to   about   25   diapers   depending   on   the   size .   my   only   issue   is   the   price   for   these .   you   only   get   about   10   per   box .   anyone   who   has   a   baby   or   has   had   a   baby   knows   how   many   diapers   a   baby   goes   through   per   day   so   the   refills   can   go   pretty   quick .   i   suppose   you   could   reuse   them ,   but   i   do   enjoy   being   able   to   snap   the   top   ring   closed   and   toss   since   the   smell   can   get   pretty   bad .
giggles   santa   brought   my   grandbaby   a   bumbo   seat   to   nannan   s   house   and   we   love   it .   i   can   set   her   on   the   large   island   in   my   kitchen   while   i   cook .   i   am   still   within   arm   reach   from   her .   the   tray   is   a   great   play   station .
attractive   and   works   great   i   hesitated   to   buy   these   bumpers   after   reading   the   reviews   here ,   but   i   m   glad   that   i   took   a   chance   and   bought   them !   some   of   the   reviews   made   it   sound   like   the   bumpers   would   collapse   at   the   slightest   touch   and   then   remain   collapsed   and   have   to   be   adjusted   frequently ,   but   i   haven   t   found   this   to   be   the   case .   as   long   as   the   bumpers   are   put   on   correctly   i . e .   tightly ,   with   the   panels   overlapping   as   per   the   instructions   this   is   not   a   problem   at   all .   i   am   delighted   at   how   these   bumpers   look   and   work .   br   br   as   for   the   look ,   my   son   s   room   features   chocolate   brown ,   light   blue   and   some   yellow ,   and   these   bumpers   look   great   with   the   velour   chocolate   brown   sheet   in   his   crib   they   re   a   really   nice   shade   of   light   blue .   br   br   as   for   the   function ,   make   sure   the   edge   of   the   bumper   is   just   below   the   top   of   mattress   this   will   help   keep   the   bumpers   in   place ,   as   well   as   prevent   little   hands   and   feet   from   getting   under   the   bumper .   you   should   also   make   sure   to   install   these   tightly   when   you   velcro   them   around   the   crib   rails   this   will   allow   the   bumpers   to   spring   back   into   position   quickly   after   little   legs   and   arms   push   down   on   them .   br   br   i   like   that   my   baby   can   see   through   the   bumper   a   little   and   look   around   his   room   as   he   likes   when   he   wakes   up   in   the   morning .   now   that   he   s   standing ,   of   course ,   he   usually   looks   over   the   bumper   instead   of   through   it ,   but   at   least   i   know   he   can   stand   there   safely ,   unable   to   use   the   bumpers   to   try   to   climb   out .   br   br   the   only   thing   i   don   t   like   about   this   product   is   that   changing   the   sheets   tends   to   pull   it   out   of   place ,   as   the   mattress   fits   very   tightly   in   the   crib   and   rubs   against   the   railing   coming   out   and   when   it   s   being   put   back   in .   but   this   is   a   problem   i   would   have   with   any   bumper   given   how   tightly   the   mattress   fits   into   the   crib .   overall ,   i   love   these   bumpers !
octotunes   i   bought   this   for   my   5   month   old   as   a   christmas   present   after   reading   all   the   great   reviews   about   it .   she   is   not   that   interested   in   this   toy   right   now .   she   has   other   toys   that   have   the   touch   feel   sound   concept   similar   to   this   one   and   likes   them   but   doesn   t   seem   to   like   this   one .   maybe   she   will   with   time ...
love   our   new   seat !   this   seat   is   great .   it   adjusts   easily ,   transports   easily ,   and   its   easy   to   clean .   the   great   thing   is   that   i   know   it   will   work   well   for   a   long   time   and   i   could   probably   even   save   for   my   own   grandkids .
cool   idea ,   but   hate   the   pacifier   i   thought   this   little   invention   would   solve   our   nightly   issue   of   fussiness   b   c   of   a   lost   pacifier .   perhaps   if   the   soothie   pacifiers   weren   t   so   huge ,   my   baby   girl   could   keep   it   in   her   mouth .   the   wubbanub   would   have   worked   perfectly   if   the   design   of   the   pacifier   was   different .   i   ll   try   again   when   she   finds   her   hands   ,   maybe   she   will   be   able   to   place   it   into   her   own   mouth   then .   if   not ,   it   was   just   another   gimmick   i   fell   for .
perfect   stroller !   i   did   a   lot   of   research   and   this   stroller   was   exactly   what   i   was   looking   for .   it   s   extremely   light   and   rides   super   smooth .   the   turning   radius   is   great   as   well .   i   love   being   able   to   access   the   basket   from   the   front   and   back .   i   also   love   the   child   s   tray   can   be   opened   on   either   the   left   or   right   side .   my   daughter   loves   being   in   it .   another   positive   is   the   way   it   closes .   it   actually   closes   yet   remains   standing   so   it   s   very   easy   to   pick   up   and   put   it   in   my   car .   my   other   maclaren   umbrella   stroller   wold   crash   to   the   ground   when   i   tried   closing   it .   my   only   negative   would   be   that   i   can   t   seem   to   get   my   daughter   to   sit   up   as   much   as   i   like .   since   the   adjustment   for   the   relining   seat   is   a   strap ,   it   won   t   allow   me   to   pull   it   tight   enough   to   have   her   sit   up   straight .   that   makes   it   difficult   for   her   to   get   her   drink   or   snacks   in   the   tray .   i   also   have   a   bob   duallie   which   i   love   but   it   s   very   bulky   and   heavy .   this   stroller   is   perfect   for   quick   trips   to   the   store .   i   also   purchased   the   asin   b005pk1g76   diono   buggy   buddy   stroller   organizer ,   black   and   it   works   perfectly .   great   for   holding   extra   drinks ,   cell   phone ,   keys ,   etc .   don   t   hesitate   to   buy   this   stroller !   highly   recommend !   and   as   always   the   shopping   experience   with   amazon   was   amazing !
it   s   ok   it   needs   measurements ,   but   once   you   get   used   to   it ,   you   won   t   feel   the   need   to   measure   the   milk   anymore .   our   daughter   accepted   it   immediately .

great   locks   for   keeping   out   little   hands !   i   fist   saw   these   locks   at   my   son   s   daycare .   they   are   amazing   and   i   love   that   they   don   t   require   screws ,   which   would   mess   up   my   cabinets .   these   are   really   easy   to   install   and   my   21   month   old   son   can   pull   to   his   heart   s   delight   and   they   don   t   come   open .   my   husband ,   however ,   has   managed   to   pull   it   open   and   broke   one   of   the   locks ,   but   he   had   to   pull   pretty   hard   to   do   it .   you   definitely   need   extra   keys   because   there   is   nothing   more   frustrating   than   searching   for   a   key   to   open   your   locks ,   hence   the   broken   one   by   my   husband .   my   only   problem   with   these   is   that   they   don   t   work   well   on   drawers ,   as   the   drawers   have   a   lip   on   them   and   they   can   t   be   installed .   they   work   wonderfully   for   cabinets   though .   i   highly   recommend   them !   i   think   that   they   would   also   work   well   for   a   cabinet ,   such   as   a   medicine   cabinet ,   that   you   don   t   want   babysitters   and   other   people   to   get   in   to .   for   that   kind   of   use ,   i   would   definitely   use   the   screws   to   install .
mostly   great   trainer   there   is   much   to   like   about   this   trainer .   the   sizing   seems   accurate ,   it   holds   a   whole   pee   and   a   poop   hate   to   say   it   while   many   other   trainers   do   not .   plus ,   with   the   side   open   snaps ,   changing   said   poop   is   less   disgusting .   but   with   all   that   said ,   there   are   a   few   tiny   complaints .   because   of   it   s   built   in   absorbency ,   it   takes   forever   to   air   dry .   i   ve   always   preferred   to   air   dry   my   pul   lined   items ,   but   i   gave   up   on   the   trainer   and   tossed   it   in   the   dryer .   also ,   for   some   reason ,   maybe   the   angle   of   the   side   snaps ,   this   is   very   hard   for   my   son   to   pull   up   on   his   own .   now   that   he   s   really   getting   the   hang   of   pottying ,   this   has   become   more   of   an   issue .   do   i   recommend   it   sure .   but   just   consider   all   the   points   about   a   trainer   with   built   in   absorbency .
very   cool ! !   we   bought   this   for   our   1   year   old   son ,   and   he   loves   it !   it   s   pretty   big ,   so   prob   not   a   good   idea   for   smaller   homes   apartments .   if   you   have   the   room ,   your   kid   will   love   it .   it   really   gives   them   a   sense   of   their   own   space ,   and   freedom   to   play   however   they   want .   not   very   tall ,   tho .   really   only   for   early   toddlers ,   as   it   comes   apart   pretty   easily .
so   cute   i   loved   this .   it   s   so   cute .   my   2   year   old   wears   it   for   painting .   easily   washable   and   adjustable   for   size .
if   you   re   breastfeeding ,   and   terrified   of   bottles ...   get   these !   i   have   two   kids ,   a   daughter   who   s   10 ,   and   a   son   who   is   now   almost   6   weeks   old .   as   much   as   i   wanted   to   breastfeed   my   daughter ,   it   just   didn   t   work   out ,   and   i   think   the   bottles   she   was   given   early   on   were   a   huge   part   of   the   problem .   bottles   require   only   sucking   no   compression   and   make   the   baby   a   lazy   eater   .   breastfeeding   requires   a   lot   of   work   sucking   the   nipple   to   the   back   of   the   mouth ,   waiting   for   let   down ,   compression ,   sucking ,   etc .   and   if   a   baby   has   used   a   bottle ,   they   can   often   times   get   frustrated   trying   to   go   back   to   the   breast .   for   this   reason ,   i   waited   until   my   son   was   4   weeks ,   before   introducing   any   bottles .   even   though   i   d   given   him   time   to   get   a   good   latch ,   establish   good   breastfeeding ,   etc .   i   was   honestly   still   pretty   scared   of   bottles .   i   know   it   s   rare ,   but   there   are   times   that   one   bottle   ruins   baby   s   breastfeeding ,   and   that   was   my   worst   nightmare .   i   mean ,   the   first   week   of   breastfeeding   is   no   party ,   and   i   was   finally   to   the   enjoyable   part .   after   tons   and   tons   of   research ,   i   purchased   these   bottles ,   and   to   my   surprise   no   issues .   first   of   all ,   he   took   this   bottle   right   away ,   as   if   he   couldn   t   even   tell   the   difference   between   this   and   his   normal   food   source   .   he   sucked   it   down ,   ate   the   whole   thing   which   was   only   2   ounces   since   we   were   testing   them   and   was   still   hungry .   i   offered   him   my   breast ,   and   he   took   it   instantly .   no   weird   latch   issues ,   nothing   off   perfect .   we   ve   since   given   him   several   bottles   over   the   last   couple   weeks ,   and   everything   has   gone   just   as   well .   so   glad   we   decided   on   these   bottles .   i   can   t   say   what   would   wouldn   t   have   happened   if   we   d   gone   with   another   brand ,   but   i   do   know   that   there   is   nothing   more   i   could   have   hoped   for   with   these .   i   also   know   that   my   niece   tried   several   bottles   on   her   ebf   daughter ,   before   trying   these ,   which   are   the   first   ones   she   took !   i   see   other   reviewers   complaining   of   the   extra   part   since   there   are   essentially   2   parts   to   the   nipple   but   that   is   such   a   non   issue ,   really .   it   isabsolutely   worth   one   more   part   to   be   able   to   use   these   fantastic   bottles !
love   it !   i   have   been   using   this   stroller   for   6   months   now   and   totally   love   it .   i   am   recommending   it   to   everyone   i   can .
cute   little   dog   cute   my   son   enjoys   it ,   but   the   sounds   and   music   can   get   pretty   annoying .   but   it   doess   entertain   my   son
plastic   board   on   the   seat   padding   poses   a   danger   there   is   a   hard   plastic   board   on   the   back   of   the   seat   padding   which   is   not   safe   for   children   who   like   to   rest   their   heads   on   it .   my   baby   had   a   cut   on   the   back   of   her   head   when   she   turned   from   one   direction   to   another .   the   plastic   board   is   sharp   enough   to   cut   the   skin   as   the   fabric   of   the   seat   padding   is   thin .
could   use   better   quality   control   the   first   bag   i   took   out   of   the   box   leaked .   i   ve   since   been   testing   each   bag   before   use .   used   four   more ,   one   of   which   also   leaked .   will   not   be   buying   more   of   these   after   i   finish   the   box   that   was   purchased .
keep   them   warm   sleep   sack   was   large   enough   to   last   through   a   year   s   worth   of   growth   and   keep   my   grandchild   warm   through   a   minnesota   winter .   high   quality   fleece   and   just   as   pictured .
outstanding   monitors   in   every   respect   i   previously   had   a   non   digital   monitor   and   it   was   driving   me   crazy   because   there   was   always   static   coming   through   it   and   i   was   always   trying   to   move   it   to   a   different   location   to   decrease   the   static .   i   lost   a   lot   of   hours   of   sleep   to   that   thing .   br   br   so   i   was   looking   for   something   digital   and   this   is   just   perfect .   this   monitor   has   several   things   i   love   br   br   1 .   there   is   never   any   static   whatsoever .   all   you   hear   is   the   noises   that   are   actually   happening .   br   br   2 .   it   isn   t   set   too   sensitive ,   like   most   monitors   are .   in   fact   there   is   a   noise   gate ,   so   if   the   room   is   below   a   certain   threshold ,   no   noise   comes   through .   you   don   t   hear   breathing   and   eyes   blinking ,   but   you   do   hear   any   cry   perfectly   and   even   any   thump .   we   turn   on   very   quiet   music   for   my   older   child   to   listen   to   and   typically   we   do   not   hear   it   at   all   through   the   monitor .   that   s   a   feature ,   not   a   bug .   anyone   who   thinks   this   is   not   sensitive   enough   must   be   a   first   parent   and   wants   to   torture   themselves   with   every   little   noise .   but   it   does   hear   any   little   cry   from   across   the   room ,   even   ones   that   are   not   very   intense .   i   would   say   the   sensitivity   is   perfect .   br   br   3 .   it   is   sooooooo   convenient   to   have   two   parent   units .   one   stays   permanently   next   to   my   bed   and   the   other   is   out   in   the   livingroom .   you   can   turn   the   volume   up   or   down   as   makes   sense .   also   there   s   a   visual   indicator   of   how   loud   the   noises   are .   works   very   nicely   in   fact   it   is   more   sensitive   than   the   audio ,   so   you   can   see   noises   that   you   can   t   don   t   want   to   hear .   br   br   4 .   these   units   also   feature   a   vibrate   warning   if   a   noise   at   a   certain   level   occurs .   my   wife   loved   it   but   i   am   a   light   sleeper   and   found   that   feature   too   jarring ,   so   we   don   t   use   it .   br   br   5 .   the   parent   units   warn   you   if   they   don   t   have   a   signal   e . g . ,   if   the   baby   unit   got   unplugged   or   something   .   br   br   i   hear   people   complain   about   the   battery   life   in   these .   i   can   t   comment   because   i   don   t   use   the   batteries   at   all .   who   does   you   just   leave   it   plugged   in   in   the   relevant   location   and   you   always   know   what   s   going   on .   there   may   be   varying   opinions   on   the   right   way   to   use   these ,   but   i   can   detect   no   reason   to   use   a   battery   at   all .   if   you   are   carrying   it   around   with   you   to   get   the   mail   or   something ,   you   might   be   a   little   too   paranoid .   br   br   these   monitors   have   been   a   life   saver .   they   perfectly   address   all   my   concerns   about   monitors ,   sound   great   when   they   need   to ,   and   don   t   bother   me   the   rest   of   the   time .   i   would   definitely   buy   them   again   and   recommend   them   to   others .   they   have   helped   me   sleep   soundly   and   also   confidently .   that   sleep   is   completely   golden   for   the   sleep   deprived   parent . going   on .   there   may   be   varying   opinions   on   the   right   way   to   use   these ,   but   i   can   detect   no   reason   to   use   a   battery   at   all .   if   you   are   carrying   it   around   with   you   to   get   the   mail   or   something ,   you   might   be   a   little   too   paranoid .   these   monitors   have   been   a   life   saver .   they   perfectly   address   all   my   concerns   about   monitors ,   sound   great   when   they   need   to ,   and   don   t   bother   me   the   rest   of   the   time .   i   would   definitely   buy   them   again   and   recommend   them   to   others .   they   have   helped   me   sleep   soundly   and   also   confidently .   that   sleep   is   completely   golden   for   the   sleep   deprived   parent .
very   small ,   but   i   guess   it   works   i   am   throwing   my   sister   s   baby   shower   and   i   purchased   these   thinking   that   they   would   be   perfect   for   the   don   t   say   baby   game .   these   pins   are   teeny   tiny .   like   the   length   of   half   of   my   pinky   finger .   i   guess   i   figured   they   would   be   a   bit   bigger ,   based   on   how   you   play   the   game ...
i   cannot   believe   this   actually   works   i   have   to   admit ,   i   was   a   skeptic .   my   two   year   old   who   thinks   he   is   5   or   6   could   care   less   about   the   time   out   chair ,   or   the   naughty   stey   thank   you   jo   fine   ...   but   for   some   crazy   reason   the   fact   this   was   portable   and   i   d   be   consistent   and   whip   it   out   when   needed   anywhere   we   were ...   worked !   so   much   so   that   after   his   melt   downs   he   d   announce   hge   was   finished   he   stayed   on   this   mat   100   of   the   time   and   yes ,   i   am   shocked   lol   and   he   would   fold   it   and   give   o   me   to   put   back   in   my   bag .   for   some   reason   when   i   bought   it   i   thought   it   came   with   all   you   see   so   want   to   be   clear   it   is   just   the   mat   and   the   little   blue   bag   it   comes   in .   i   believe   the   other   pieces   are   probably   sep .   i   think   that   this   is   great   as   far   as   portability .   if   you   have   a   toddler   that   needs   to   understand   the   two   min   time   out   rule   who   thinks   it   doesnt   apply   when   not   at   home   this   will   be   a   helpful   tool   for   you !   but   this   doenst   do   the   trick   alone !   your   patience   and   consistency   in   using   it .   it   took   two   tries   and   it   was   set   in   stone   for   us .   every   child   is   different   but   i   am   sure   that   in   knowing   this   is   in   your   bag   they   will   be   less   tempted   to   continue   misbehaving   as   they   see   teh   blue   sack   come   out   of   your   purse !   and   yes ,   it   is   small   enough   for   a   purse !   also   very   easy   to   clean !
love   it !   i   bought   this   for   my   baby   and   it   is   a   perfect   mat   for   playtime .   it   is   colorful   with   great   textures .   also   shipped   very   quickly !

graco   sarah   i   spent   a   long   time   researching   cribs   as   i   do   with   most   big   purchase   items   ,   and   this   crib   is   phenomenal   for   the   money !   i   put   it   together ,   9   months   pregnant ,   with   my   10   year   old   daughter .   it   went   together   flawlessly ,   we   had   no   missing   or   extra   parts ,   and   everything   went   as   it   should .   i   ve   put   together   quite   a   bit   of   furniture ,   and   the   ease   of   this   assembly   was   great !   we   didn   t   have   a   hard   time   at   all   with   the   instructions ,   and   all   in   all ,   are   very   happy   with   this   purchase .   the   crib   is   very   sturdy ,   and   the   color   looks   rich   and   expensive .   would   buy   again ,   every   time   highly   recommend !
awesome   except ...   i   bough   this   stroller   because   it   had   such   rave   reviews .   i   never   tested   it   prior   to   buying   so   after   making   my   purchase   on   amazon   i   got   too   excited   to   wait   and   went   to   my   local   baby   store   to   play   around   with   it .   the   push   on   this   stroller   is   awesome   and   the   quality   is   amazing   but   my   daughter   who   is   4   a   rather   short   4   year   old   could   not   sit   comfortably   with   the   sun   shade   collapsed   it   came   behind   her   head   and   pushed   her   head   forward .   when   it   was   extended   she   sat   comfortable   but   had   less   than   an   inch   to   the   top .   i   had   read   some   reviews   that   said   it   was   not   great   for   bigger   kids   but   my   daughter   is   not   very   tall   so   i   thought   she   would   be   fine .   luckily   amazon   has   an   amazing   return   policy   and   was   so   helpful .   other   than   the   head   room   issue   i   loved   this   stroller .
it   does   exactly   what   i   want   it   to   do ,   it   just   doesn   t   hold   enough   the   poor   thermos   foogo   phases   leak   proof   stainless   steel   straw   bottle ,   10   ounce   is   being   deprived   of   a   fifth   star   basically   because   i   am   a   grown   up   who   wanted   something   designed   for   kids .   the   colors   were   prettier ,   ok   i   like   the   design   it   works   great ,   it   s   just   that   if   i   want   it   to   hold   water   to   hydrate   me ,   it   s   too   small   if   i   want   it   for   flavor ,   well .   at   least   it   s   good   portion   control !
looks   like   great   art   for   a   pirate   this   is   much   better   than   the   stick   and   peel   decals   that   you   can   place   anywhere .   this   goes   on   the   wall   just   as   you   see   if   you   want   it   that   way   .   it   was   in   about   25   pieces ,   but   the   nice   thing   that   i   wasn   t   expecting   is   inside   their   is   a   diagram   on   how   to   hang   it ,   and   the   pieces   are   numbered .   it   made   putting   the   dotting   lines   up   easy .   it   took   a   little   more   time   but   looks   amazing .   i   have   it   in   the   kids   bathroom ,   and   it   really   makes   the   little   bathroom   come   alive   like   a   pirate   map .   the   best   part   is   the   kids   love   it !
love   i   am   so   pleased   with   this   product !   i   ordered   this   so   that   i   could   see   my   baby   girl   while   she   is   sleeping   in   my   bed ,   we   co   sleep   and   i   am   usually   not   ready   to   go   to   bed   when   she   does ,   so   naturally   leaving   her   alone   on   our   bed   was   a   concern .   i   set   this   up   in   less   than   5   minutes .   the   picture   with   night   vision   is   super   clear   and   the   sound   sensitivity   is   great .   i   love   that   the   monitor   hand   held   is   rechargeable   i   hate   buying   batteries .   the   price   was   well   worth   it   and   the   quality   is   more   than   what   i   expected .
disappointed   i   loved   that   this   mattress   adds   padding   to   my   daughters   play   yard   as   we   use   it   as   a   bassinet .   however ,   i   was   very   concerned   about   the   smell   i   aired   this   mattress   out   for   a   few   weeks   before   she   arrived   and   i   could   still   get   a   hint   of   the   awful   smell   when   i   changed   the   sheets .   i   had   to   replace   this   item .   i   would   think   an   item   made   for   babies   would   be   made   of   better   quality .
i   wish   my   son   liked   pacifiers ...   i   tried   this   pacifier   after   reading   the   reviews   and   my   son   liked   it   better   than   the   tommie   tippie   ones   i   got   from   my   shower .   my   life   would   be   much   easier   if   he   liked   them .   but   the   one   thing   that   i   loved   is   that   thy   came   in   individually   wrapped   sterilized   bag   so   i   could   start   using   them   right   away !
new   baby   grandson   got   this   for   my   new   baby   grandson   keaton .   he   will   be   born   on   1   16   12   and   i   gave   it   to   his   parents   for   christmas .   they   were   so   excited   and   i   know   he   will   love   his   little   monkey   paci .
a   must   have ! ! !   even   if   you   use   a   lot   still   lasts   long   time !   these   have   been   a   must   have   in   my   house   since   my   daughter   was   born .   i   love   them   bc   they   can   be   used   in   so   many   ways ... i   use   for   pacifiers ,   bottles ,   toys ,   basically   anything   that   drops   or   needs   a   quick   clean .   also ,   no   need   to   get   the   travel   pack   bc   you   can   put   them   in   a   sealed   baggy   or   i   use   a   really   small   plastic   container   that   snaps   and   seals   shut .   they   don   t   dry   out   either !   my   daughter   stopped   using   a   pacifier   at   about   3   1   2   months   she   s   5   months   now   but   i   still   use   them   all   the   time   for   the   above   mentioned .   must   have ! ! ! !   it   s   also   a   great   shower   gift   bc   that   s   how   i   got   hooked !
love   these   we   got   these   at   the   hospital   and   they   are   the   only   ones   my   son   will   use .   he   can   even   put   them   into   his   mouth   all   by   himself .
awesome !   i   love   these .   my   son   i   m   sure   will   too .   they   seem   to   be   made   very   durable   for   babies .   i   can   t   wait   for   my   son   to   be   here   in   a   couple   weeks   to   try   them   out .
the   only   pacifiers   my   kids   will   use !   these   are   the   easies   to   clean   and   best   shaped   pacifiers   out   there .   both   of   my   girls   only   took   these   pacifiers   and   i   trusted   them   and   the   product .   you   can   t   go   wrong   with   these !
finally   he   accepted   one   my   son   would   t   take   any   pacifier   before   giving   him   this   one .   an   added   plus ,   u   can   insert   ur   finger   to   harden   it   if   he   needs   extra   soothing   for   teething .   very   hygenic   too   as   water   won   t   come   in   to   his   mouth   from   any   hidden   place   after   sterilizing .   i   love   it
it   has   been   opened   before   i   got   it   it   has   been   opened   before   i   got   it , and   i   am   very   disspointed   by   this   thing . so   i   hope   it   won   t   happen   again .
love   this   pacifier !   this   is   the   best   pacifier   that   i   have   ever   seen ! !   i   used   to   nanny   and   wish   that   i   had   seen   this   then .   after   having   my   own   child   and   getting   this   as   a   shower   gift ,   i   will   use   them   for   every   child .   when   my   son   was   first   born ,   the   frog   helped   the   pacifier   stay   in   his   mouth .   as   he   has   grown ,   it   has   been   great   to   help   him   find   the   pacifier   easily   when   it   comes   out   of   his   mouth   and   he   loves   holding   it   in   his   hands .   i   see   him   grab   at   the   feet   of   the   frog   when   he   is   really   tired   and   it   is   soothing   for   him .   i   have   a   small   blankie   that   it   attached   to   it   we   call   it   wonder   frog   and   it   has   been   great   for   him   to   self   soothe   and   hold   on   to .   i   highly   recommend   this   product ,   especially   for   babies   that   are   very   aware   of   and   use   their   hands .
she   loves   them !   i   don   t   really   know   what   it   is   but   my   little   one   will   only   take   these   pacifiers .   i   tried   pretty   much   every   brand   of   pacis   out   there   and   the   only   ones   she   ll   take   are   the   ones   shaped   like   the   soothies .   i   love   the   fact   that   they   are   soft   so   if   she   rolls   over   them   they   won   t   hurt   her .   at   first   i   was   worried   cuz   i   thought   the   round   shape   covering   her   nose   would   be   a   problem ,   but   now   i   see   it   doesn   t   block   her   nose   at   all   and   she   seems   very   comfortable   sucking   on   them .   i   think   these   are   just   great .
perfect   this   is   the   same   brand   used   by   the   hospital   where   our   children   were   born .   perfect .   this   is   exactly   what   we   wanted   in   lovely   feminine   colors
priced   just   right   just   what   i   was   looking   for   good   quality   and   priced   right .   shipped   very   fast   too .   great   to   put   in   with   other   sports   stuff
the   pacifier   to   have ...   in   true   breastfeeding   fashion ,   we   waited   until   our   son   was   four   weeks   old   before   offering   any   pacifiers   to   make   sure   we   had   good   attachment   and   technique   down   don   t   really   believe   in   nipple   confusion ,   but   it   helps   everyone   involved   not   to   be   stuffing   a   newborn   s   mouth   with   a   pacifier   from   day   one   .   one   we   passed   that   magic   milestone   of   four   weeks ,   we   opened   our   new   wubbanub   and   a   fast   appreciation   was   had   babies   love   to   suckle !   it   calms   them   and   allows   them   to   gather   themselves   in   the   middle   of   a   meltdown .   it   is   great   to   carry   them   through   to   the   next   feeding   when   they   get   older   if   you   are   trying   to   sleep   train .   my   son   falls   asleep   within   minutes   when   i   put   him   down   in   his   crib ,   awake   with   the   wubbanub   he   always   spits   it   out   after   he   is   asleep ,   but   no   need   to   restuff   his   mouth .   the   little   monkey   legs   and   arms   lay   on   the   chest   and   help   the   pacifier   stay   put .   he   also   loves   to   grab   it   with   his   hands   and   arms   in   a   big   hug .   our   other   pacifiers   have   laid   useless   in   the   diaper   bag   ever   since   we   started   using   this   one   would   not   have   bought   any   other   if   i   had   know   the   power   of   the   wubba !
not   solid   colors   i   know   it   says   colors   and   designs   may   vary ,   but   i   assumed   since   solid   colors   are   pictured   i   was   going   to   get   solid   pacifiers ...
perfect   baby   loves   the   pacifier   and   does   not   reject   it   at   all .   seems   to   fit   beautiful   face   perfectly   great   company   and   good   choice   in   pacifiers
easy   to   findwe   we   love   it !   makes   paci   easy   to   find .   my   1   month   old   wraps   his   arm   around   it   while   he   sucks .   helps   keep   it   in   his   mouth .
yankee   pacifiers .   my   son   in   law   is   a   yankee   fan   otherwise   i   would   have   purchased   orioles .   of   course   after   14   years   of   losing   mabey   yankees   was   a   better   choice .
our   favorite   pacifier   we   love   how   simple   the   avent   soothie   pacifier   is ,   perfect   for   newborns   and   infants .   these   are   bpa   free   and   are   the   1   hospital   recommended .   typically   the   hospital   has   them   there   in   the   green   color   and   since   we   are   having   a   girl   this   time ,   i   am   bringing   the   pink   purple   one   from   home  
cute   bulkier   looking   than   what   i   was   expecting .   it   kind   of   protrudes   out   of   my   daughter   s   mouth .   it   served   it   s   purpose   for   that   one   day   and   a   few   others   since   she   likes   pacifiers .   it   is   very   cute   and   got   great   reactions .
dino   wubbanu   like   this   item   but   i   didn   t   know   that   the   pacifier   is   attched   and   couldn   t   be   taken   off .   would   love   to   buy   another   one   that   i   can   take   the   pacifier   off   for   cleaning .
dream   on   me   playard   mattress   good   mattress   for   the   money .   we   bought   this   mattress   for   the   occasional   use   of   our   chico   playard ,   when   we   are   traveling .   this   mattress   certainly   made   our   baby   more   comfy   than   without   it .   it   s   a   little   softer   than   her   crib   mattress   because   its   not   of   the   same   quality ,   which   was   expected .   i   would   not   recommend   the   mattress   for   everyday   use   but   certainly   works   well   for   occasional   use   since   i   believe   babies   need   more   back   support   or   firmer   mattress .   i   would   not   recommend   that   a   baby   sleep   on   this   mattress   if   they   cannot   lift   their   head   easily   and   rollover   on   their   own .   my   baby   was   over   8   months   when   we   bought   this   so   that   is   not   a   concern   any   longer .
poorly   made   none   available .
such   a   sweet   blanket !   this   blanket   is   very   soft ,   warm   and   beautiful !   its   a   great   accessory   for   any   beautiful   baby   i   got   this   as   a   gift   to   my   niece   and   her   mom   loves   it
faith   s   favorite   my   5   month   old   niece   faith   received   this   from   me   for   christmas .   it   is   soft   as   butter ,   and   intrigues   our   new   little   addition   to   the   family .   she   appears   to   love   it   as   much   as   her   older   sister   and   brother   loved   their   own   taggies   when   they   were   little .   it   has   been   reported   that   she   also   perceives   it   to   be   a   good   pacifier   as   well .
best   diaper   covers   i   ve   tried   when   i   decided   to   use   cloth   diapers ,   i   bought   a   variety   of   different   brands   and   types   to   try .   these   are   my   favorite .   i   like   that   there   is   only   two   sizes   and   that   they   are   easily   washable   and   dry   fast ,   so   you   need   less   covers   to   go   through   the   day   as   compared   to   pocket   diaper   covers   which   get   wet   together   with   the   cloth   insert   i   only   need   three !   i   use   them   with   bummis   cloth   diaper   inserts   and   bumkins   flushable   liners .   there   is   also   a   version   of   this   diaper   cover   that   has   snaps ,   but   i   find   them   a   bit   cumbersome   to   use .
mutsy   it   gives   good   versatility   to   mutsy   transporter   to   use   it   for   transportation   of   a   newborn   by   mutsy   transporter   chasis   without   neccessity   to   take   the   baby   out   of   the   child   seat .   i   did   not   give   full   five   star   value   because   it   is   quite   difficult   to   release   the   child   seat   from   adapters .   at   least   i   have   not   found   a   trick   to   do   it   easily   yet   and   i   have   to   struggle   with   the   stroller   for   a   while .
why   all   the   drama   both   versions   of   these   liners   work   great !   there   are   dozens   of   dramatic   reviews   on   different   versions   of   the   diaper   dekor   refill   and   system .   people   are   apparently   very   passionate   about   diaper   pails .   br   br   i   have   tried   the   biodegradable   and   non   biodegradable   versions   of   the   refills .   i   have   not   noticed   any   difference   in   smell   quality   between   them .   i   also   use   biodegradable   diapers ,   so   it   makes   sense   to   keep   everything   eco   friendly   when   i   can   and   i   like   that   diaper   dekor   gives   you   the   option   of   choosing   from   green   or   regular   liners .   br   br   highlights   br   br   1   simple ,   straightforward   re   fill   design .   the   plastic   is   one   long   roll   which   you   tie   off   as   you   use   it .   super   easy   and   will   save   you   money   in   the   long   run .   br   br   2   no   stink .   i   have   used   the   diaper   dekor   system   and   the   regular   and   biodegradable   refills   for   2   years   now   and   i   have   never   had   a   problem   with   stink .   no   diaper   pail   will   smell   fresh   if   its   kept   full   for   days   on   end   and   never   cleaned   out .   i   empty   the   pail   every   4   5   days   you   just   tie   it   off ,   so   you   re   not   wasting   liners   ,   and   i   also   run   a   sanitizing   wipe   along   the   inside   and   the   top .   that   keeps   it   fresh   and   sanitary .   br   br   3   price   because   of   the   tie   it   off   system ,   you   end   up   only   using   as   much   of   the   refill   roll   as   you   need .   want   to   empty   the   pail   after   a   particularly   smelly   diaper   fine   tie   off   after   a   couple   inches .   leaving   it   full   for   many   days   no   problem   tie   off   a   few   few   feet .   its   a   much   less   expensive   system .   br   br   biodegradable   or   regular   both   work .
baby   swing   swing   works   well .   music   is   adjustable   so   that   music   or   nature   sounds   can   be   soft   enough   to   soothe   baby .   rocking   is   gentle .   however ,   there   is   a   slight   rubbing   noise .   would   definitely   recommend .
excellent   quality !   bought   for   my   10   year   old   grandson   for   christmas .   i   was   impressed   by   the   quality   in   the   package   upon   arrival .   it   was   his   favorite   gift   on   christmas   morning .   he   started   using   without   instructions   and   keep   busy   for   hours .   the   items   are   top   quality   wood   and   store   together   in   the   big   box .   it   just   would   be   nice   to   have   a   way   to   keep   the   box   closed   for   storage   when   not   performing .
sophie   we   love   sophie   the   giraffe .   my   six   month   old   can   t   get   enough   of   her   great   teether   and   easy   for   her   to   grasp .   would   definitely   recommend   this   to   anyone   with   kiddos .
terrible   playard   i   am   extremly   dissappointed   with   this   product .   the   bassinet   is   not   sturdy ,   it   falls   in   and   hugs   baby   somewhat .   the   mattress   pad   is   awful   and   thin .   we   have   now   placed   the   baby   in   the   bottom   and   there   is   a   bar   that   you   can   feel   through   the   padding .   i   have   called   evenflo   and   they   are   not   concerned   about   about   helping   me .   they   documented   my   concerns   and   told   me   sorry   you   don   t   like   your   product .   wow ,   will   never   buy   a   product   from   them   if   they   do   not   care   about   trying   to   help   a   customer   with   a   not   so   great   product .
nice   a   nice   set ,   the   blanket   is   soft   and   thicker   then   some   of   the   others   in   different   sets .   i   have   returned   several   stay   away   from   trend   lab ,   cheap   thin   scratchy   material   .   it   looks   a   bit   girly   in   the   picture   my   husband   was   not   thrilled   when   i   showed   him   what   i   ordered   ,   however   once   it   arrived   and   we   placed   in   the   crib   it   doesn   t   look   girly   at   all .   i   think   it   was   because   it   was   pictured   in   a   white   crib ,   we   have   a   dark   wood   crib .   i   was   looking   for   a   set   with   out   a   theme .   i   dislike   giant   animals   or   dinos   all   over   the   babys   room .   i   think   it   looks   expensive   and   very   neutral .   the   ties   on   the   bumpers   could   be   longer .   the   material   could   be   even   more   soft   but   i   feel   that   this   is   the   best   quality   that   i   have   found   for   under   200 .
it   is   perfect   for   my   son .   i   have   a   7   month   old ,   he   has   been   teething   since   3   months   old   but   just   started   cutting   a   tooth   this   week .   he   started   refusing   a   pacifier   since   2   months   old   so   i   was   a   little   weary   about   purchasing   this   but   gave   it   a   go .   he   absolutely   loves   it .   he   is   chewing   on   it   while   on   my   lap   as   i   type   this   review .   the   tooth   that   is   coming   in   has   been   hurting   him   very   badly   as   you   can   imagine   so   he   s   been   real   angry   the   last   few   days .   this   teether   is   perfect   for   him   though ,   it   fits   just   right   in   his   mouth   and   his   hand .   i   supervise   when   he   chews   on   anything   but   i   don   t   see   this   coming   apart .   if   you   re   worried   then   supervise   your   child   while   he   has   it .   oh   and   i   didn   t   buy   this   online   i   bought   it   from   toys   r   us .   not   to   mention   it   is   bpa   free ,   100   silicone ,   and   can   be   frozen .   the   package   actually   states   to   use   under   adult   supervision ,   to   replace   every   month   or   two ,   and   to   inspect   it   before   each   use   and   dispose   of   immediately   if   damaged .   for   those   trying   to   decide   whether   to   buy   or   not   and   haven   t   read   the   1   star   reviews   but   just   see   that   there   are   20   one   star   reviews   most   of   the   one   star   reviews   are   either   because   their   child   doesn   t   like   it   or   it   is   too   big   for   their   childs   mouth .   as   with   anything ,   every   child   is   going   to   have   a   different   opinion .   my   picky   little   boy   who   hates   pacifiers   loves   it   and   there   are   also   other   picky   little   babies   who   hate   pacifiers   who   also   hate   this   teether .
great   product   and   great   customer   service !   we   ordered   this   swing   after   the   one   that   we   used   with   our   first   3   children   broke !   we   have   loved   it !   the   first   time   we   received   this   package   the   swing   seemed   to   be   defective .   however ,   we   contacted   amazon   and   within   48   hours   had   a   new   one   at   our   door   that   has   worked   perfectly !   it   was   easy   to   assemble ,   the   material   is   extremely   soft ,   seems   very   comfortable   for   baby ,   and   baby   loves   looking   at   herself   in   the   mirror !
it   s   the   only   one   my   baby   will   take ,   and   it   helps !   i   ve   tried   several   teethers   for   my   a   4   month   old ,   she   s   ignored   every   single   one   of   them   and   continued   to   be   very   uncomfortable   at   times .   then   i   noticed   tiny   bite   marks   on   her   little   hands !   i   found   this   theether ,   thanks   to   all   amazon   reviewers .   this   one   is   just   the   right   shape ,   size ,   thickness   and   texture   she   can   hold   it   and   turn   it   the   way   she   wants   nicely .   she   still   puts   her   fists   into   her   mouth ,   but   no   bite   marks   any   more   she   uses   her   avent   teether   for   when   she   needs   to   bite   real   hard .   the   actual   colour   is   a   bit   warmer   than   the   one   in   the   picture .   cute ,   safe   and   it   really   works !
perfect   amount   of   light   this   lamp   looks   great   in   my   sons   room   and   matches   the   rock   n   roll   collection   perfectly !   it   also   give   off   just   the   right   amount   of   light .   it   s   not   glaringly   bright   like   the   ceiling   fan   light   but   it   s   still   bright   enough   to   read   him   books .   the   light   is   a   nice   soft   light .   coming   with   its   own   light   bulb   is   a   nice   plus   too .
it   s   ok   wanted   the   newton   s   cradle   for   my   grandchildren .   for   adult   use   it   is   fine   but   small   too   delicate   for   children ,   it   tangles   very   easily .
my   baby   loves   it ....   our   little   fellow   has   enjoyed   this   toy   greatly ....   he   especially   likes   the   mirror   super   fun   for   making   faces   at ,   crooning   to ,   and   mouthing   and   the   clicking ,   moveable   triangle   teethers .   he   uses   this   to   this   day   to   chew   as   his   teeth   slowly   emerge .
ruined   after   first   wash   i   bought   this   for   our   new   graco   element   playard   after   reading   many   positive   reviews   on   amazon .   in   anticipation   of   our   baby   s   arrival ,   i   washed   it   so   that   we   d   be   all   set .   also ,   a   pre   wash   is   recommended   on   the   packaging   .   but   after   following   the   manufacturer   s   washing   instructions   cold   wash ,   tumble   dry   low   ,   the   vinyl   melted   and   gathered   in   one   big   spot   on   the   back .   so   now   there   are   a   bunch   of   holes ,   and   the   pad   isn   t   going   to   stretch   enough   to   even   fit   the   mattress .   very   disappointing .   what   a   waste   of   money !   also ,   as   a   side   note ,   when   i   tested   the   sizing   on   the   pack   n   play   mattress   before   washing   ,   it   was   too   big .   i   figured   it   d   be   fine   once   i   put   a   lot   of   effort   into   making   sure   to   pull   and   smooth   any   extra   material   to   the   underside   of   the   mattress .   and   after   i   put   a   sheet   over   top   to   help   hold   everything   in   place .   for   reference ,   this   is   the   playard   we   have   graco   element   pack   n   play   playard   with   bassinet  
best   nasal   aspirator   i   have   found   this   nasal   aspirator   better   than   even   the   hosptial   blue   one .   i   have   found   the   suction   is   excellent .   i   have   used   it   for   the   past   5.5   years   with   my   3   children .   the   two   piece   aspirators   don   t   give   enough   suction .   this   one   squeezes   well .   i   haven   t   found   thickness   in   mine   a   problem   it   is   actually   softer   than   the   hospital   version ,   and   that   s   why   i   feel   it   s   better .   the   bonus   is   the   cute   factor ,   which   all   my   children   love .   they   are   tempted ,   though ,   to   chew   on   the   trunk !
well   worth   the   size   good   price   for   under   6   each .   also   like   that   one   side   is   waterproof   and   the   other   side   is   fabric   cotton   i   think   .   and   the   size   is   spot   on   not   too   small   and   not   overly   large   as   to   be   cumbersome .   folds   well   so   you   can   put   it   in   your   diaper   bag .   haven   t   needed   to   wash   it   yet .
broke   in   less   than   3   months   of   use   i   loved   this   wipe   warmer   at   first ... it   has   a   nice   light .   it   warmed   up   wipes   within   2   hours .   the   wipes   were   a   nice   temperature .   but   all   of   the   sudden ,   ours   stopped   working .   i   bought   a   replacement   moisture   pad   not   sure   of   the   actual   name   that   goes   in   the   bottom   of   the   warmer   and   still ,   no   luck .   what   good   is   a   35   dollar   wiper   for   2   1   2   months  
big   boy   seat   we   havent   had   it   long   but   he   loves   sitting   in   the   chair   and   looks   very   comfortable .   it   was   a   little   difficult   to   install   but   that   is   history   now .
a   nice   addition   to   soften   any   standard   sized   pack   and   play   mattress   although   this   isn   t   as   thick   as   i   thought   it   would   be ,   in   conjunction   with   the   quilted   sheet   we   purchased   for   our   pack   and   play ,   it   really   makes   a   nicely   padded   mattress   for   the   baby .   with   our   older   child ,   we   could   not   get   her   to   sleep   in   the   pack   and   play ,   and   i   truly   believe   most   of   it   had   to   do   with   the   hard ,   thin   mattress   that   comes   with   the   playyard .   i   do   not   think   that   this   by   itself   with   a   simple ,   unpadded   fitted   sheet   on   top   is   enough   to   compensate   for   the   lack   of   padding   in   the   stock   mattress .   do   yourself   a   favor   and   order   a   carter   s   fitted   quilted   velour   sheet   or   something   similar .   our   playyard   measures   26   inches   by   almost   39   inches   and   these   fit   very   well ,   leaving   no   gaps ,   even   in   the   bassinette   function   of   our   pack   and   play .   we   have   yet   to   try   this   with   our   baby   as   our   baby   is   not   due   for   a   few   weeks   yet ,   but   i   am   very   encouraged   and   hopeful   that   this   will   be   much   more   comfortable   than   the   stock   mattress   alone   with   a   fitted   sheet .   i   will   update   later .
charming   bought   this   as   a   x   mas   gift   for   granddaughter . age   7 .   seems   to   be   made   well ,   i   really   wish   it   plugged   in   so   it   could   be   used   as   a   night   light .   it   s   really   cute .   she   loves   finding   the   constellations .   good   item .   thanks   amazon   for   great   service ,   as   always !
so   adorable !   this   is   adorable !   it   was   easy   to   put   together ,   had   great   instructions !   not   a   bouncer   bouncer   though   as   i   wished   it   would   be ,   but   does   have   a   slight   bounce   to   it .   the   toys   on   it   are   very   entertaining   for   baby .   amazons   shipping   was   amazingly   fast   overall   happy   with   my   purchase !
do   not   but   it   ! ! ! !   cuts   wifi   voice   activation   doesn   t   work   so   cheap   i   did   buy   bc   100   not   even   worh   40   levana   501   the   best   after   trying   4   monitor   whit   in   2   week
worked   great   for   my   nephew ,   i   wish   it   worked   well   for   our   baby !   excellent   quality   and   safe   organic   rubber   material   and   most   babies   love   them   that   actually   take   a   pacifier .   our   child   won   t   take   any   pacifier   however .   if   our   child   would   use   pacifiers   these   would   be   our   first   option .
good   in   theory   only   although   very   cute ,   does   not   really   help   in   keeping   the   pacifier   in   place .   if   the   animal   ours   is   the   monkey   were   weighted   a   little   more   i   presume   this   is   a   safety   feature   it   would   possibly   work   better .   if   the   baby   is   lying   flat   on   his   back   it   does   assist   a   little ,   if   reclined   at   all   in   swing   or   car   seat   which   is   where   you   really   need   it ,   we   have   not   found   it   to   be   any   better   in   keeping   the   pacifier   from   falling   out   as   frequently .
love   these   pacis   these   little   pacifiers   are   great !   they   are   made   of   the   same   material   i   believe   it   s   the   same   brand   too   as   the   soothies   the   hospital   gives   out   but   they   don   t   cover   the   whole   face .   the   design   makes   it   look   like   my   baby   is   smiling   and   it   s   adorable .   these   let   my   baby   breathe   and   enjoy   her   paci .
baby   loves   this   one !   so   we   ve   tried   almost   all   of   the   popular   brands .   she   loves   the   mam   design !   almost   seems   effortless   for   her   to   suckle .   the   shape   of   the   nipple   seems   to   make   the   most   sense .   as   the   baby   learns   to   start   rolling   over   and   crawling ,   the   pacifier   design   became   so   much   more   important   to   us .   this   on   actually   displaces   the   impact   when   she   face   plants   while   learning   to   crawl ... you   ll   see .   great   to   have   the   removal   strap   option   that   clamps   the   pacifier   to   her   clothes .   these   are   overall ,   easy   to   clean   and   we   found   that   at   least   in   our   baby   s   case ,   we   know   when   to   replace   them ... when   the   graphic   starts   to   wear   off ,   its   time .
note   cannot   use   this   with   other   pacifiers   animal   is   attached   cute   idea ,   but   i   didn   t   realize   when   i   bought   this   that   the   pacifier   is   actually   sewn   to   the   stuffed   animal .   i   purchased   it   thinking   i   could   attach   my   own   pacifiers   to   this   stuffed   animal ,   but   instead   it   came   with   its   own   pacifier   actually   sewn   to   it .   thankfully   it   came   with   the   same   pacifier   i   use   asin   b0045i6iao   philips   2   pack   avent   soothie   pacifier ,   green ,   0   3   months   however ,   i   like   to   boil   pacifiers   before   initial   use   can   t   do   that   here   and   was   hoping   to   be   able   to   use   the   stuffed   animal   for   different   nuk   pacifiers   as   they   wear   down ,   etc .   had   i   know   that   it   wasn   t   a   pacifier   holder ,   but   rather   an   all   in   one   deal ,   i   wouldn   t   have   purchased   this   product .   bummer !
best .   invention .   ever !   a   must   have   for   moms !   i   thought   they   were   just   adorable   when   i   started   buying   wubbanubs   as   gifts   for   friends .   now   that   i   am   a   mom   myself   i   can   see   how   genius   these   are ! ! ! !   since   binky   s   alwaysssss   fall   out ,   these   animals   sit   on   their   chest   and   prop   up   the   pacifier !   so   if   he   yawns   it   won   t   fall   out .   it   is   also   easy   to   find   and   he   likes   to   hold   on   to   it   and   seems   to   cuddle   with   it .   they   are   just   darling   and   we   love   them .   we   just   buy   more   as   they   get   worn   out   from   our   wear   and   tear .   highly   recommended   and   definitely   worth   every   penny ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
nuk   pacifiers   are   the   best   these   are   great   pacifiers .   my   baby   prefers   the   shape   of   the   nuk   pacifiers   over   other   brands   the   exterior   is   curved   down   below   the   nose   and   the   orthodontic   shape   of   the   silicone   pacifier .   plus ,   the   sports   theme   is   very   cute .   i   did   buy   these   at   a   local   retail   store   so   i   could   choose   a   package   that   include   a   baseball   football   pacifer .
didn   t   end   up   working   out   okay ,   so   on   the   cute   factor   scale   these   things   are   a   clear   5   stars .   the   little   lamb   and   it   is   little   is   precious   and   you   can   t   help   but   say   awww   when   you   first   see   it .   it   s   a   great   concept ,   and   any   parent   that   has   played   the   retrieve   the   binky   game   is   hoping   it   will   work .   so   far   for   us   it   s   been   about   50   successful .   the   little   lamb   s   feet   are   slightly   weighted ,   so   if   our   daughter   is   lying   still   in   her   rumble   chair   and   you   get   the   binky   in   her   mouth   and   the   lamb   spread   out   right   it   does   work .   the   problem   is   at   11   weeks   she   s   not   exactly   lying   still   all   that   often   but   she   doesn   t   have   the   hand   control   to   hold   on   to   the   lamb .   she   still   has   the   whole   arms   swinging   wildly   startle   reflex   going ,   so   more   often   than   not   she   knocks   the   lamb ,   which   pops   the   binky   out   of   her   mouth ,   defeating   the   whole   purpose .   she   can   t   control   her   hands   enough   yet   to   then   get   it   back   in .   br   br   on   the   upside ,   it   does   prevent   the   binky   from   rolling   off   onto   the   floor   and   it   makes   it   much   easier   to   find   and   put   back   in   her   mouth .   i   can   see   the   potential   for   this   product   and   hope   when   she   gets   older   and   can   actually   hold   on   to   the   lamb   it   will   work .   i   m   giving   it   a   3   star   rating   for   now   for   cuteness   and   potential   and   hope   to   upgrade   to   a   4   or   5   star   rating   in   the   future .   br   br   update   a   year   later   and   i   m   afraid   this   little   lamb   never   really   worked   out   for   us .   by   the   time   my   daughter   had   enough   hand   control   to   no   knock   the   lamb   out   she   was   keeping   a   binky   in   her   mouth   more   readily   and   she   would   grab   this   little   guy   to   examine   and   again ,   pull   the   binky   out   of   her   mouth .   we   ended   up   using   binky   leashes ,   which   were   perfect   for   our   needs .   she   recently   rediscovered   this   little   guy ,   and   while   she   s   too   big   to   need   him ,   she   did   enjoy   popping   the   binky   in   and   out   of   her   mouth   a   few   times   holding   the   lamb ,   but   then   became   angry   that   the   lamb   wouldn   t   give   up   his   prize .   at   this   point ,   this   guy   is   holding   on   to   one   star   from   us   for   sheer   cuteness   and   one   for   what   could   be   a   great   idea   for   another   child ,   but   i   m   afraid   he   never   quite   worked   out   for   us .   we   have   friends   who   swear   by   him   however ,   so   it   may   work   for   your   child .   br   br   as   a   note   it   would   be   nice   if   there   was   some   way   to   attach   and   detach   the   binky .   if   she   had   used   this   frequently   i   could   see   it   getting   dirty   and   needing   to   be   washed ,   which   would   be   tricky   without   getting   laundry   detergent   on   the   binky .   on   the   reverse   side ,   you   would   want   to   wash   the   binky   with   dish   soap   but   not   the   lamb .   the   only   decent   solution   is   to   handwash ,   and   what   busy   parent   has   time   for   that   plus   at   my   daughter   s   current   age   i   could   see   her   loving   to   carry   this   little   guy   around   if   she   could   get   the   binky   out   of   his   mouth   and   it   would   have   been   nice   to   have   given   the   toy   a   second   life .  
dallas   cowboy   pacifiers   adorable .   arrived   promptly .   the   parents   were   very   satisfied   with   them .   the   baby   girl   took   to   them   right   away .   she   cries   if   she   drops   it .   i   have   to   laugh   out   loud .   parents   are   avid   cowboy   fans .
wish   they   weren   t   clear   at   first   i   thought   a   clear   pacifier   was   so   fabulous .   no   annoying   bright   colors   in   any   baby   pictures !   but   finding   a   dropped   pacifier   on   the   floor   is   a   real   pain   because ...   they   re   clear .   they   re   definitely   my   sons   favorite   pacifier   but   they   are   also   the   kind   you   ll   want   to   strap   to   your   baby   so   you   don   t   spend   time   looking   on   the   floor   for   a   dropped   paci .
the   best   pacifier   works   great   for   breastfeeding   mothers .   has   a   nice   cutout   for   the   nose   for   small   babies ,   great   for   premies   to   use .   they   re   soft ,   not   hard   plastic ,   and   helps   our   baby   sleep   through   the   night .   highly   highly   recommend ! !   only   downside   is   that   it   s   hard   to   find   these   outside   of   amazon ,   though   they   are   starting   to   sell   a   variation   of   it   under   the   first   years   brand .
love   em   was   a   little   big   when   my   grandbabies   were   newborns   but   they   quickly   grew   into   them
i   love   this   little   critter ! !   this   is   the   most   adorable   little   creature !   my   baby   is   actually   a   nuk   fan ,   but   she   will   take   the   soothie   from   time   to   time ,   especially   when   her   sweet   lamb   is   attached !   it   has   been   a   great   way   to   help   her   keep   the   pacifier   in   her   mouth ,   and   she   loves   to   hold   the   lamb   while   it   s   on   her   chest .   i   m   just   so   disappointed   that   the   lamb   is   currently   unavailable .   i   ve   searched   several   times   for   it   for   recently   born   babies ,   but   no   luck .   we   haven   t   had   any   issues   with   the   pacifier   falling   off ,   or   the   lamb   getting   dirty .   i   think   it   would   hold   up   to   a   good   washing ,   though .
so   smart ! ! !   i   love   that   the   nose   is   cutout   for   infants ! !   soooo   smart ! ! !   we   always   thought   the   ones   from   the   hospital   looked   like   they   were   blocking   an   infants   nose !
fun ,   but   heavy   these   are   cute   and   good   quality ,   but   quite   heavy .   they   work   for   my   9   month   old   and   may   be   too   heavy   for   a   younger   baby .
paci   meets   lovey   our   daughter   loves   her   wubbanub .   i   purchased   this   when   she   was   only   a   few   weeks   old   and   she   used   it   regularly   for   a   couple   of   months .   it   sat   nicely   on   her   chest ,   especially   when   she   was   in   her   car   seat .   i   love   that   the   pacifier   is   attached   to   the   little   cuddly   elephant   because   it   makes   it   so   much   easier   to   find   in   the   car ,   at   night ,   in   her   crib ,   etc .   our   daughter   also   loves   to   hold   on   to   it .   even   if   she   wasn   t   able   to   get   the   paci   part   back   in   her   mouth   she   would   often   chomp   on   the   legs   or   another   part   to   keep   herself   happy .   the   reason   why   i   gave   this   4   stars   instead   of   5   is   because   i   wish   you   could   switch   out   the   type   of   pacifier .   our   daughter   no   longer   prefers   soothie   pacis   but   we   still   give   this   to   her   to   play   with .
great   baby   present   we   bought   a   few   of   these   for   our   newborn   and   liked   it   so   much   that   we   bought   this   one   for   a   friend   s   new   baby
great   teether   like   other   reviewer ,   my   son   is   not   really   into   using   a   pacifier .   instead   he   uses   this   mostly   as   a   teether ,   occasionally   sucking .   he   flips   it   around   using   the   loop   and   the   edges   to   teeth .   i   feel   better   knowing   what   it   is   made   of   and   not   finding   out   later   on   that   it   has   a   plastic   product   that   only   later   was   seen   to   cause   problems .   so   far   it   has   lasted   through   two   teeth   with   no   wear   and   tear .
same   as   hospital   brand   and   no   nipple   confusion   we   received   a   pacifier   at   the   hospital   that   our   son   loved   and   didn   t   seem   to   cause   nipple   confusion .   these   seem   to   the   same   brand   and   we   bought   quite   a   few   of   them .   our   son   at   6   months   still   loves   them   and   now   likes   to   chew   on   the   sides .   they   are   a   good   size   and   the   baby   can   handle   and   hold   them   well .   one   thing   to   note   when   they   fall   they   are   like   super   balls   and   settle   in   the   toughest   area   to   reach .   it   becomes   a   bit   of   a   game   where   did   the   pacifier   go   the   packaging   says   0   to   6   months   and   we   are   now   looking   for   a   replacement .   i   am   not   sure   we   really   need   one   though .
ugh   everyone   seems   to   love   these .   i   received   four   or   five   of   them   from   the   hospital   and   they   were   all   vanilla   scented   . but   they   will   not   stay   in   my   sons   mouths   i   have   to   fall   asleep   with   my   hand   holding   it   in   his   mouth ! ! !   bc   he   will   wake   up   if   it   out ,   its   so   heavy   and   odd .   i   have   a   wub   anub   but   realistically   is   everyone   going   to   buy   on   to   use   these   nope   ....   also   my   son   is   7   weeks   and   he   will   grab   onto   the   little   tab   that   sitcks   out   and   rip   it   out   of   his   mouth   and   then   scream   when   its   gone ,   major   design   flaw ..   obv   its   so   you   can   pull   it   out   but   jezz   it   makes   my   life   harder .   and   when   you   drop   them   they   fly   all   over   the   friggen   place   like   a   possessed   bouncy   ball   from   hell   who   has   it   out   to   make   your   life   and   your   screaming   babies   life   hell   while   you   are   searching   for   it .   only   to   find   it   ten   minutes   later   15   ft   across   the   room   in   the   opposite   direction .   im   still   searching   for   the   perfect   pacy   for   my   baby
no   more   lost   binky !   cute   yes ,   but   i   really   bought   this   for   me ,   it   helps   me   keep   track   of   the   binky   pacifier   .   the   colors   are   bright   and   our   3   month   old   is   able   to   grab   it   and   pull   the   bink   to   his   mouth   all   on   his   own .   i   like   that   it   is   super   lightweight   and   there   are   no   beads   for   a   possible   choking   hazard   if   a   seam   opened   up .   the   wubbanub   won   t   get   lost   in   a   seat   crevice   or   hit   the   floor   and   roll   under   a   sofa   and   it   is   easily   seen   even   at   night .   we   spot   clean   the   dragon   as   needed   and   wash   the   soothie   on   a   regular   basis   and   have   had   no   issues   with   pilling   or   fading .   no   regrets   on   this   purchase .   16.95   and   free   shipping .
my   son   is   a   pacifier   addict   these   are   the   only   pacifiers   either   of   my   sons   would   use ,   they   are   great ! i   would   buy   them   again   again
love   it !   i   found   one   in   a   local   store   they   are   very   difficult   to   find ,   and   my   son   hasn   t   lost   a   binkie   since !   i   clip   it   to   his   shoulder ,   and   he   s   able   to   find   it   easily .   no   issues   with   him   rolling   over   on   it ,   since   its   always   out   of   the   way .   cute ,   and   perfect   for   keeping   binkie   close   at   hand .
life   saver   this   is   a   healthy   way   to   keep   baby   happy ,   stress   free   and   have   some   freedom   to   get   tasks   done   with   a   happy   baby !   a   great   tool   for   any   parents   lucky   enough   to   have   a   baby   who   love   them !
great   product   this   is   a   great   product .   it   comes   with   a   cover   which   is   very   convenient   because   you   can   close   the   it   and   it   doesn   t   get   dirty .   it   s   also   good   quality ,   my   newborn   loved   it .   make   sure   this   is   the   first   pacifier   you   give   your   baby   because   they   tend   to   like   the   first   one   they   got   and   don   t   always   adapt   to   new   pacifiers   later .
fabulos   must   have   for   little   ones ...   great   quality   and   love   the   pattern .   easy   to   find   in   a   bag   or   purse .   we   have   several   diff   patterns .
the   only   pacifier   the   baby   takes ...   happens   to   be   the   safest !   this   natural   rubber   pacifier   is   the   only   one   our   baby   took   from   day   one ,   our   little   one   loved   this   paci .   br   br   its   healthy ,   natural   rubber   which   means   less   worries   given   how   much   direct   exposure   babies   have   to   pacifiers .   no   nasty   chemicals ,   no   scary   ingredients .   br   br   the   only   negative   is   the   cost   they   are   super   expensive   and   they   tend   to   bounce   when   dropped ,   which   makes   them   a   little   hard   to   find .
good   stuff .   it   s   a   nice   little   rubber   soother ...   easy   to   clean .   don   t   have   to   worry   about   petroleum   chemicals ,   which   is   nice .   not   sure   what   else   to   say .   my   only   complaint   is   that   the   age   recommendation   is   difficult   to   find   on   the   packaging ,   if   not   impossible   to   find .   i   believe   i   ordered   one   that   was   for   3   9   months ,   but   when   i   received   it ,   i   couldn   t   find   this   information   on   the   packaging ,   and   felt   that   the   pacifier   was   on   the   larger   side .
baby   hates   it   i   have   no   complain   about   the   product ... but   the   baby   just   do   not   like   it ... she   takes   any   pacifier   bu   not   this   one ...   donno   why ..
expensive   but   worth   it .   these   are   the   only   pacifiers   we   trust   with   our   baby .   while   the   cost   is   questionable ... the   ingredients   to   make   the   pacifiers   are   top   notch   and   are   devoid   of   dangerous   chemicals   such   as   bpa   .   they   last   on   average   about   2   months   for   us .
terrific   monitor   when   working   but   failed   after   only   8   months   of   use   we   really   loved   this   monitor   which   i   believe   has   been   discontinued   and   a   newer   model   has   rolled   out   and   we   used   it   with   our   baby   every   day   evening .   we   alternated   between   battery   usage   and   ac   usage ,   and   we   never   dropped   or   damaged   the   unit .   we   thought   the   sound   quality   was   decent ,   and   the   picture   quality   was   pretty   good ,   and   we   were   really   happy   with   this   product   as   a   gift .... until   it   stopped   working   after   only   8   months   of   use .   the   adapter   jack   just   stopped   recognizing   the   ac   adapter   so   we   couldn   t   plug   it   in   to   use   nor   recharge   the   batteries .   so   we   had   to   resort   to   using   regular   batteries   and   boy   does   that   monitor   eat   up   regular   batteries   we   had   to   replace   every   1   2   days   .   br   br   anyway ,   3   stars   for   the   unit   failing   so   soon   no   wonder   the   warranty   is   only   a   year   ... but   5   stars   for   customer   service .   summer   infant   s   customer   service   team   was   very   responsive ,   very   considerate   and   extremely   quick   to   address   the   issue .   we   just   made   the   warranty   period   thank   goodness   ,   but   summer   infant   did   not   hassle   us   at   all .   george   first   tried   to   help   us   troubleshoot   and   then   when   we   isolated   the   issue   to   the   adapter   jack ,   george   was   super   quick   and   efficient   at   helping   us   get   a   replacement .   i   really   have   to   give   it   to   george   and   summer   infant   for   good   customer   service .   sorry   to   the   other   reviewers   who   did   not   have   a   good   experience   .   because   this   unit   has   been   discontinued ,   summer   infant   quickly   sent   out   a   replacement   we   got   it   about   a   week   after   we   sent   our   defective   unit   in   ,   and   the   replacement   is   the   newer   best   view   monitor   and   camera ,   which   is   a   marked   improvement   over   the   old   version .   hopefully   the   product   issues   with   the   older   model   have   been   worked   out .   so   far ,   so   good !
amazing   this   toy   is   amazing .   i   ve   never   seen   a   hand   boiler   before .   i   bought   this   for   my   10   year   old   daughter .   i   think   i   ll   play   with   it   more   than   she   will !   it   s   very   educational   if   you   look   into   how   it   works .   love   it .
if   only   it   washed   the   bottles   by   itself   this   brush   works   great !   i   replace   these   brushes   about   once   every   2   or   3   months   and   they   do   the   job .   i   wish   they   came   in   multipacks   but   as   it   is ,   i   buy   several   at   once .   works   in   bottles   with   narrower   mouths   dr .   browns ,   not   wide   mouth   .
poo   poo   potty   this   is   the   absolutely   most   horrible   potty !   the   seat   absorbs   all   liquid ,   and   makes   the   seat   smell   like   old   urine !   i   can   not   get   the   smell   out   either .   i   always   wipe   down   the   seat   with   a   damp   cloth   when   my   son   is   done   with   it ,   but   that   doesn   t   help .   i   have   emailed   safety   1st   and   all   they   want   to   do   is   send   me   a   new   seat .   for   what   its   just   going   to   get   smelly   again .   they   only   thing   this   potty   is   good   for   is   the   step   stool .   horrible ! ! !   do   not   buy   this   potty ! ! !
malden   noah   s   ark   metal   photo   frame   purchased   to   go   with   a   noah   s   ark   nursery .   can   t   wait   to   put   a   photo   of   our   2   boys   in   it   together .   very   nice   piece .   sturdily   made .   heavy   it   is   metal   ,   but   a   great   buy .   definitely   adds   to   the   room .
best   bottles   by   far   these   nipples   were   cheaper   on   amazon   than   anywhere   else .   great   being   able   to   change   nipple   size   without   having   to   rebuy   the   entire   bottle .
great   product   i   first   bought   this   product   2   years   ago   when   my   daughter   turned   2 ,   she   s   now   4   and   we   still   use   it   every   day   on   our   home   table   top .   her   twin   brothers   have   now   turned   2   and   i   bought   two   more   of   them   to   use   for   their   place   setting   as   well .   i   like   it   because   it   keeps   plastic   plates   and   bowls   from   sliding   around   and   possibly   falling   on   the   floor .   my   daughter   s   mat   is   over   2   years   old   and   is   strain   and   rip   free .   only   thing   i   don   t   like   about   the   mat   is   the   suction   cups   because   it   makes   it   hard   to   put   an   open   cup   right   on   the   mat   without   having   a   spill .   overall ,   i   really   like   the   mat   and   we   use   it   every   day   and   it   gets   washed   every   day   and   still   works   great .
very   well   made   and   sturdy   looks   nice   too .   i   recently   purchased   this   gate   and   installed   it   in   just   a   couple   of   minutes .   i   don   t   have   kids .   i   have   a   dog   and   a   bird .   dog   wanted   to   go   in   bird   s   room   and   tear   up   newspaper   and   scavange   around ,   dragging   stuff   around   the   house   making   a   mess .   that   had   to   stop .   so   i   got   this   gate   to   put   in   the   doorway   of   the   bird   s   room .   the   very   cool   thing ,   to   me   anyway   easily   entertained   ,   was   that   i   could   install   it   in   the   door   frame   and   it   didn   t   interrupt   use   of   the   door   so   i   could   still   close   his   door   at   night   and   keep   it   open   during   the   day ,   leaving   the   baby   gate   there   to   block   the   dog   from   entering .   br   br   the   gate   is   powder   coated   metal   and   is   very   sturdy   and   well   made .   it   feels   secure   and   strong   where   i   put   it .   the   gate   opens   pretty   easily .   at   first   i   had   to   get   the   feeling   of   it   push   in   button   and   lift   a   little   bit   to   get   it   to   clear   the   locked   area   and   it   was   a   cinch   after   that .   br   br   i   love   that   you   can   push   it   all   the   way   open   in   either   direction   and   have   it   stay   open   when   you   want   it   that   way .   or ,   just   open   it   enough   to   go   through   it   and   let   it   fall   closed .   since   it   can   open   out   into   either   direction ,   that   makes   it   more   versatile   because   you   can   install   it   with   the   latch   on   either   side ,   thereby   allowing   you   to   have   it   open   to   the   left   or   right .   br   br   i   like   it   so   much   that   i   just   ordered   another   one   for   my   stairwell .   i   don   t   want   the   dog   going   upstairs   into   my   office   when   i   m   not   there   and   i   ve   just   been   blocking   the   entrance   at   the   top   of   the   stairs   with   a   sheet   of   styrofoam   at   night .   looks   tacky .   i   can   put   this   down   near   the   foot   of   the   stairs   and   it   will   look   much   better ,   plus   i   can   just   leave   it   swung   open   during   the   day .   br   br   i   cannot   think   of   anything   i   do   not   like   about   this   gate .   the   learning   curve   in   getting   it   up   right   was   very   small .   i   also   like   that   you   don   t   have   to   put   screws   or   nails   in   the   walls   if   you   don   t   want .   the   tension   mount   works   very   well .   it   also   comes   with   2   expansion   panels .   i   didn   t   use   those   with   my   first   one ,   but   will   be   using   them   for   my   stairwell .   br   br   this   is   noteworthy   the   gate   has   all   straight   lines ,   unlike   the   main   picture   they   have   here   on   the   website   currently .   the   one   with   the   curved   outer   bars   is   not   the   one   that   i   received .   mine   does   say   model   4910 ,   just   like   in   the   description .   but   i   felt   it   was   noteworthy   to   advise   that   this   model   has   all   straight   bars .   see   the   variety   of   pictures   they   provided   and   some   of   them   do   reflect   that .   see   pictures   i   have   loaded   here   showing   one   gate   without   extensions   and   the   other   using   both   extensions .   for   my   stairwell .   this   is   noteworthy   the   gate   has   all   straight   lines ,   unlike   the   main   picture   they   have   here   on   the   website   currently .   the   one   with   the   curved   outer   bars   is   not   the   one   that   i   received .   mine   does   say   model   4910 ,   just   like   in   the   description .   but   i   felt   it   was   noteworthy   to   advise   that   this   model   has   all   straight   bars .   see   the   variety   of   pictures   they   provided   and   some   of   them   do   reflect   that .   see   pictures   i   have   loaded   here   showing   one   gate   without   extensions   and   the   other   using   both   extensions .  
changing   pad   seems   comfortable   my   infant   loves   this   changing   pad .   she   finds   it   to   be   more   comfortable   than   her   moses   basket !   we   are   not   using   a   cover   though   and   there   is   already   a   little   hole ,   maybe   from   her   scratching   it .   i   am   happy   with   it   though   and   would   recommend   it .
my   son   loves   them   it   s   a   great   idea   to   use   as   a   self   soother   instead   of   a   pacifier .   sometimes   my   son   can   t   find   the   pacifier   in   the   dark   room   so   he   plays   with   his   silkie .   also   love   that   you   get   two   so   he   always   has   one   when   the   other   is   in   the   wash .
tx   mommy   this   wrap   is   amazing !   i   have   two   of   them   so   i   can   keep   one   in   the   car   and   one   in   the   house .   i   have   been   stopped   numerous   times   by   strangers   who   asked   where   to   get   this   sling   and   i   can   t   stop   raving   about   it   to   all   of   my   mommy   friends !   getting   baby   in   and   out   of   is   a   breeze   and   i   couldn   t   be   happier   about   being   able   to   nurse   discretely   while   in   public .   i   would   recommend   watching   the   included   dvd   as   it   shows   how   to   position   your   baby   and   even   shows   how   you   can   get   twins   in   it !   i   can   t   speak   highly   enough   about   this   product !
perfect   these   are   great .   easy   to   dispense   when   you   re   in   a   hurry   which   is   often   the   case   .   thinner   than   some   other   brands   but   still   strong   enough .   they   do   exactly   what   they   are   intended   to   do .
a   go   to   laugh   learn !   we   bought   this   about   4   years   ago   for   our   oldest ..   we   still   have   it   in   the   toy   box   and   my   18   month   old   loves   it .   it   also   was   a   great   hit   for   my   now   3   1   2   year   old   son .   it   lasted   great   through   all   three   kids   and   even   at   almost   5   years   old   my   daughter   likes   to   play   with   it .   we   never   had   any   problems   with   shapes   not   fitting   right .
don   t   waste   your   money   i   returned   this   item   the   same   day   it   arrived .   one   other   review   stated   that   it   looked   like   it   came   from   the   dollar   store   and   i   would   have   to   agree .   it   has   a   space   for   a   plug   for   a   c   power   but   no   adapter   was   included   and   it   was   not   compatible   with   any   adapter   i   had .
buy   nosefrida   instead ! ! !   i   have   the   nosefrida   and   wanted   an   extra   one   so   decided   to   try   this   since   it   was   a   bit   cheaper   and   does   not   require   the   foam   inserts .   bad   idea !   you   have   to   have   powerful   lungs   to   use   this .   i   sucked   and   sucked   and   sucked   and   nothing   comes   on .   one   suck   with   my   nosefrida   and   my   baby   s   nose   is   clear .   i   really   regret   this   purchase .   the   shape   is   weird   since   the   force   from   the   suction   has   to   bend   whereas   the   nosefrida ,   it   goes   straight   so   the   force   is   not   lessened   as   it   reaches   the   nose .   also   the   hole   on   the   tip   is   smaller   than   nosefrida   so   it   gets   clogged   during   suctioning .
cute ! !   i   got   these   just   in   time   for   a   wedding .   my   15   mon   old   looked   adorable   in   them !   they   were   a   good   size   and   were   great !
baby   loves   it ,   mama   loves   it !   my   son   has   never   been   a   diehard   binky   addict   like   my   older   daughter   was ,   but   i   wanted   to   try   something   a   little   more   stylish   than   the   tried   true   soothies   we   ve   always   used .   these   were   on   a   special   promo   i   thought   why   not .   i   m   very   pleased   with   them   so   far   about   a   week   of   use   .   my   4   month   loves   to   grab   he   can   hold   on   to   the   handle   actually   put   it   back   in   his   mouth   whether   intentional   or   not !   .   true ,   the   glow   in   the   dark   feature   doesn   t   hold   for   hours   hours ,   but   that   s   kinda   common   sense .   truth   be   told ,   anything   that   would   retain   a   bright   glow   for   that   long   wouldn   t   be   something   i   d   want   to   give   to   my   infant   anyway !   my   son   seems   to   like   these   quite   well   for   those   times   when   he   s   in   need   of   a   comfort   suck   doesn   t   need   a   bottle .   i   like   the   shape   of   the   nipple   how   it   s   proportionate   for   his   size   age .   i   d   recommend   these .   amazon   sent   me   the   yellow   which   is   very   cute .
totally   hysterical   this   pacifier   is   so   cute   and   could   make   anyone   laugh .   i   bought   it   as   a   shower   present   for   my   niece ,   and   there   s   nothing   like   getting   pictures   emailed   to   you   with   a   sweet   baby   using   this   bink .   it   s   a   great   little   gag   gift   to   include   in   a   present   for   a   new   mom ,   especially   if   you   tease   the   new   mom   about   twilight .
my   baby   loves   these   i   have   used   mam   pacifiers   with   all   three   of   my   babies .   i   really   like   that   they   fit   perfectly   around   their   tiny   faces ,   and   that   they   vent ,   so   baby   s   skin   doesn   t   get   irritated .   the   only   thing   i   wish   was   different   was   the   color   options   when   purchasing .   i   chose   blue ,   but   got   green   ones .   not   a   big   deal   though .   also ,   these   pacifiers   do   not   come   with   any   case   to   store   and   keep   clean ,   as   some   other   brands   do .

very   cute !   this   wubbanub   is   very   adorable   and   my   daughter   loves   it !   i   gave   it   three   stars   because   it   s   really   a   pain   to   clean
asymmetric   we   got   these   because   we   thought   gerber   was   generally   high   quality ,   and   they   were   cute .   while   it   s   not   a   horrible   pacifier ,   i   don   t   think   the   unique   shape   really   means   anything   better   for   your   baby .   br   br   one   issue   with   these   pacifiers   is   that   they   are   designed   to   have   a   certain   orientation   i . e .   one   side   is   up   .   this   makes   it   less   convenient   for   placing   the   pacifier   in   the   child   s   mouth   because   you   have   to   make   sure   it   s   the   right   direction   half   the   time   i   m   flipping   it   over   and   then   giving   it   to   him ,   rather   than   just   giving   it   to   him .   this   is   especially   annoying   in   two   cases   br   1   he   puts   the   pacifier   in   his   mouth   himself ,   and   br   2   you   re   trying   to   give   the   pacifier   at   night   in   bed   or   in   the   car   and   you   have   less   ability   to   see   what   s   going   on   br   br   since   i   think   the   orthodontics   is   pretty   much   a   gimmick ,   it   probably   doesn   t   really   matter   which   way   it   s   oriented ,   but   even   for   someone   like   me   it   s   a   little   distracting   to   think   it   s   upside   down .   br   br   the   second   issue   with   these   pacifiers   is   the   back   is   designed   with   a   slit   in   them   so   that   when   you   wash   them   water   gets   into   the   nipple   and   makes   a   squishing   noise   afterwards .   if   you   set   them   on   their   back   for   a   while   they   do   eventually   dry   drain ,   so   it   s   not   a   deal   breaker ,   but   it   does   require   extra   time   before   being   able   to   use   it   again .
perfection   i   can   t   see   how   this   gets   anything   other   than   a   5   star   review .   the   product   is   proportionally   well   created ,   with   just   enough   lip   to   make   any   baby   with   a   normal   sized   head   face   look   hilarious .   the   teeth   are   overly   large   which   makes   the   caricature   that   much   cuter .   br   br   this   product   is   perfection   from   beginning   to   end .
coolest .   binky .   ever .   this   binky   is   adorable !   i   paired   it   with   the   disguise   l   vampire   halloween   costume   12   18   months   .   my   son   used   it   a   few   times   afterwards   mostly   playing   .   it   s   heavier   than   a   normal   paci ,   so   i   would   recommend   it   for   older   babies   and   toddlers .
wrong   animal   i   ordered   the   cutsie   caterpillar   and   got   a   monkey   instead ,   and   when   i   tried   to   return   it ,   the   site   said   they   were   out   of   stock ...   be   cautions   when   ordering
16   month   old   son   still   loves   it !   we   are   on   our   3   rd   one .   my   son   loves   it .   he   sleeps   with   it   every   night   for   naps .   the   1st   one   he   pulled   the   paci   off   the   dog .   the   second   we   lost .   we   are   on   our   3rd   one .   buy   more   than   one .
outstanding !   this   pacifier   is   one   of   the   top   3   things   that   got   us   through   those   first   few   weeks   months   of   a   new   baby .   we   have   quite   a   pacifier   baby ,   but   the   pacifier   kept   falling .   even   when   standing   up   from   a   sitting   position   with   the   baby ,   a   pacifier   frequently   drops   to   the   ground .   with   the   stuffed   animal   attached ,   it   give   it   enough   weight   that   that   no   longer   happens   or   happens   less   frequently   .   as   baby   started   using   his   hands   more ,   he   could   then   hold   on   to   the   pacifier   a   little   easier .   it   also   rested   very   well   on   his   chest   in   the   carseat   and   is   larger   to   grab   and   put   back   in   baby   s   mouth   when   reaching   backwards   into   the   back   seat .   the   price   may   make   this   appear   to   be   a   more   extravagant   item ,   but   would   make   an   outstanding   shower   gift .   plus ,   the   little   giraffe   is   adorable !
got   these   free   in   the   hospital   i   received   these   free   in   the   hospital ..   don   t   waste   your   money   until   you   know   if   your   baby   likes   them   or   not .   mine   don   t   take   pacifiers
fits   2   soothies !   i   bought   this   pacifier   cast   is   a   good   size   and   fits   2   soothies   in   it !   the   hook   is   perfect   to   hook   onto   the   outside   of   your   diaper   bag .   the   case   has   holes   in   it   to   prevent   moisture   from   building   up   inside   if   the   pacifiers   were   wet .   the   case   is   bpa   free   which   is   another   plus .   looks   like   it   comes   in   orange   and   blue ,   but   you   can   t   choose   your   own   color   when   you   order   it ,   you   get   what   they   give   you .   i   received   the   orange   and   it   s   perfect   since   it   stands   out   on   my   dark   diaper   bag .
good   but ...   these   are   nice   and   soft   and   do   conform   well   to   her   face   without   the   marks   left   by   hard   backed   pacis .   however   she   does   have   trouble   sucking   on   the   round   paci   bit .   she   seems   to   have   more   luck   with   the   flat   pacis   which   may   just   be   due   to   the   fact   she   breastfeeds .   however   if   your   little   one   is   used   to   sucking   on   a   regular   round   nippled   bottle   these   would   probably   work   fine .   overall   i   think   they   are   worth   purchasing   if   your   baby   can   suck   on   them .   they   aren   t   really   soft , they   conform   to   babys   face   nicely , and   they   work   well   and   keep   her   content   when   she   can   manage   them .
cute   i   can   t   wait   to   start   using   these .   though   to   be   honest   they   smell   super   weird .   i   hope   i   get   used   to   it ...   it   s   really   overpowering   though   every   now   and   then   i   think   i   smell   them   and   they   re   not   even   in   the   room   anymore ...   lol   oh   well   as   long   as   the   baby   looks   cute   sucking   on   them   i   think   i   can   get   over   it .
great !   the   pacifier   shipped   right   on   time   and   matched   my   sons   costume   wonderfully .   i   was   very   pleased   with   this   purchase   and   would   definitely   recommend   this   item   .
dont   like   material   these   were   ok   but   the   material   feels   like   glass   kinda   like   it   would   break .   the   other   thing   is   that   there   were   only   2   pacifiers   and   not   4   as   seen   in   the   picture .
our   baby   s   favorite   pacifier   our   baby   likes   to   suck   on   this   with   someone   s   finger   inside .   and   now   that   he   s   teething ,   he   prefers   it   to   other   teething   tools .   a   note   of   caution   we   were   dog   sitting   a   1   yr   old   dog   who   sought   them   out   to   eat   them .   our   own   dogs   aren   t   interested ,   but   the   pup   sure   was .   we   had   to   buy   more !
love   it ! ! !   i   love   this   monitor !   i   bought   it   when   my   daughter   was   almost   2   when   my   monitor   broke .   i   only   wish   i   had   it   when   she   was   a   baby !   the   picture   quality   is   excellent   and   the   sound   quality   is   also   excellent !   there   is   absolutely   no   interference ,   no   static   what   so   ever .   i   highly   recommend   this   baby   monitor .
my   baby   loves   nuk   my   son   loves   nuk   pacifiers .   wish   finding   nipples   was   as   easy   as   finding   a   pacifier .   i   need   nuk   wideneck   6   mos   medium   nipples ! ! !
too   big   for   his   little   mouth ,   not   what   i   expected ...   this   product   was   recommended   to   me   by   a   co   worker   and   it   also   comes   with   a   foot   but   when   i   ordered   both ,   i   received   2   hands   but   in   all   fairness ,   the   seller   had   indicated   that   there   is   a   possibility   that   i   would   not   be   able   to   get   the   foot   and   i   was   fine   with   that .   my   son   has   yet   to   take   an   interest   in   this   product   at   all .   we   tried   all   types   of   ways   to   get   him   to   use   it   especially   now   that   his   teeth   are   breaking   but   he   tossed   it   on   the   floor   several   times   and   he   started   to   cry   each   time   we   gave   it   to   him .   it   is   not   ideal   for   younger   babies   as   it   is   simply   too   big .   i   am   not   sure   if   the   foot   is   better   but   the   hand   did   not   work   for   my   son   and   at   all .   we   had   invested   in   other   teething   toys   which   seem   to   work   so   much   better   than   this   one .   this   is   filed   under   oh   well ,   i   tried ,   but   it   did   not   work   for   us   .
good   for   newbies   good   product   for   first   time   bfing   moms .   i   was   using   bed   pillows   but   could   never   get   the   baby   at   the   right   height .   the   boppy   was   great .   it   helped   me   get   comfortable   with   bfing ,   and   now   i   don   t   need   it   anymore ,   but   still   occasionally   use   it .   cons   br   it   was   smaller   than   i   expected ,   not   sure   how   a   bigger   woman   would   fair   since   it   wraps   around   your   waist ,   and   not   sure   how   a   larger   baby   would   use   it   past   the   first   few   months .   the   owl   cover   is   super   cute   and   easy   and   to   take   on   and   off   to   wash .
love   this   drying   rack !   but   it   could   be   a   little   bigger ...   bought   this   to   use   to   dry   our   baby   s   bottles   and   it   works   great !   i   like   it   better   than   the   racks   because   you   can   put   stuff   where   you   need   it ,   regardless   of   size   or   shape   and   it   grips   items   really   well .   i   just   wish   it   was   a   little   bigger .   we   have   9   avent   bottles   and   once   you   take   all   the   pieces   apart   it   isn   t   quite   big   enough   for   all   of   them .   so   i   had   to   buy   another   one ....   but   all   in   all   it   is   definitely   worth   the   money .   just   make   sure   and   shop   around   for   it .   around   15   is   fair ,   if   they   are   showing   over   20   then   you   can   get   a   better   deal .
love   this   diaper   bag ! ! !   i   have   purchased   many   diaper   bags ,   and   this   will   be   the   last   one .   i   found   what   i   ve   been   looking   for ,   this   is   perfect   it   stays   upright   so   it   is   easy   to   look   for   items ,   and   organize   them   too !
soft   fits   i   ve   had   the   travel   crib   for   two   years   now ,   and   based   on   previous   reviews ,   i   decided   not   to   buy   the   expensive   crib   sheet   and   instead   use   less   expensive   travel   cot   sheets .   hmmm .   for   two   years ,   i   ve   struggled   to   make   them   fit   two   different   brands   .   lots   of   headaches .   finally   bought   the   baby   bjorn   sheet   and   what   do   you   know ...   it   fits .   easily .   it   is   also   very ,   very   soft .   i   haven   t   washed   or   used   it   yet   other   than   to   try   it   on   the   mattress   ,   so   i   ll   have   to   see   how   it   holds   up .   my   only   concern   is   that   it   can   t   be   tumble   dried .   does   anyone   else   put   it   in   the   dryer   and   does   it   still   hold   up   or   do   you   let   it   air   dry   the   tumble   dry   thing   is   a   bit   of   a   bummer   to   me ,   but   not   the   end   of   the   world   since   we   don   t   use   the   travel   crib   a   ton .   br   br   still ,   in   my   experience ,   i   disagree   that   other   non   baby   bjorn   sheets   fit .   at   least ,   i   didn   t   find   one   that   did .   if   you   re   going   to   spend   about   250   on   a   travel   crib ,   just   buy   the   coordinating   sheet .
leaks   i   bought   this   cup   because   my   daughter   loves   mickey   mouse   and   she   is   having   difficulties   transitioning   to   a   cup .   she   will   drink   water   from   a   sippy   cup   but   not   milk .   so   this   was   going   to   be   her   special   milk   cup   .   she   loved   that   it   was   mickey   on   the   cup .   this   cup   leaks   and   is   very   difficult   to   take   apart   to   clean .   perhaps   it   works   better   with   an   older   child   but   i   wouldn   t   recommend   it   to   a   friend .
dangerous   original   and   replacement   gates   both   failed   as   many   reviewers   have   remarked ,   this   gate   has   a   propensity   for   failing .   the   locking   mechanism   for   the   telescoping   bar   failed   on   the   first   one   that   i   bought   after   2   weeks .   wanting   to   believe   the   best ,   we   exchanged   it   for   another   one ... that   quickly   failed   in   the   same   way .   i   admit   that   this   is   a   great   idea   for   an   adjustable   gate ,   design   makes   sense   and   it   is   otherwise   well   conceived .   if   evenflo   figured   out   how   to   make   the   locking   mechanism   work   and   not   fail ,   i   would   have   given   it   5   stars .   problem   is ,   it   failed   in   the   most   important   part   that   secures   the   gate .   this   makes   the   gate   unstable   and   dangerous   to   kids .   please   do   not   make   the   same   mistake   that   i   did   twice   .   fool   me   once ...  
make   sure   it   is   right   size   and   covers   all   the   diaper   beneath   anyone   reviewing   this   product   saying   they   don   t   work   is   not   using   them   correctly .   they   are   a   dream ,   and   if   you   have   the   right   size   and   make   sure   they   cover   the   cloth   completely ,   they   will   not   leak .   it   obviously   takes   more   time   in   changing ,   but   saving   us   hundreds ,   maybe   thousands .   we   still   use   disposable   in   the   wee   hours   of   the   morning   and   when   we   travel ,   but   other   than   that ...   br   after   a   disposable   diaper   blow   out   or   two ,   we   have   started   to   use   these   over   disposables   when   she   is   in   her   fine   sunday   dress !
love   these   cups !   we   have   4   of   these   and   i   wish   they   came   in   more   gender   neutral   designs   i   have   2   boys   .   they   are   the   perfect   size   for   both   my   toddler   and   my   4   yr   old .   i   also   have   the   bowls   which   are   great   quality .
runs   small   ordered   for   my   sons   baptism .   the   quality   was   great   and   it   looked   so   cute ,   but   the   buttons   wouldn   t   stay   shut   and   i   had   to   safety   pin   the   crotch   to   keep   it   in   place .   this   may   have   been   because   it   was   too   small ...... but   my   son   is   19   lbs ,   10   months   old   so   i   thought   the   12   mo   size   would   be   perfect .   it   was   up   top   but   the   legs   were   short   and   again   hard   to   keep   buttoned   shut .   otherwise   great ,   just   double   check   the   sizing ,
fish   smell   we   bought   this   product   thinking   since   it   was   alcohol   free   it   would   be   better   to   use   at   the   diaper   changing   table .   however   it   has   a   fish   smell   after   using   it   so   i   end   up   washing   my   hands   anyway .
teddy   bear   oh   teddy   bear   i   love   this   contoured   changing   table   pad   and   actually   works   well   with   other   teddy   bear   bedding   sets .   especially   geenny   and   eddie   bauer   and   of   course   jojo   designs .
the   best   sleeper   ever !   the   rock   n   play   sleeper   is   the   best   baby   sleeper   ever !   when   my   grandson   was   born ,   a   new   mommy   friend   suggested   this   item   to   keep   at   my   house   and   i   am   so   glad   i   did .   when   my   grandson   came   to   visit ,   he   slept   soundly   in   it   and ,   because   of   the   slight   elevation ,   he   was   able   to   breathe   better .   the   sleeper   went   home   with   him !   whenever   my   daughter   needs   to   keep   him   nearby ,   the   sleeper   is   lightweight   but   very   sturdy   and   folds   conveniently   for   travel .   i   would   recommend   this   for   every   newborn .
it   works   it   works .   i   would   like   it   if   the   base   matched   the   one   you   get   with   the   seat   and   had   the   level   on   it   but   it   works .
good   quality   teether   i   wasn   t   sure   what   to   expect   with   this   toy ,   but   other   reviewers   have   long   touted   it   as   a   must   have   baby   product ,   so   i   figured   i   d   give   it   a   try .   this   squeaks   like   a   dog   toy ,   so   if   you   have   dogs   who   play   with   squeaky   dog   toys ,   beware ,   they   may   think   it   s   theirs   and   try   to   get   it !   other   than   that ,   my   baby   seems   to   like   it .   it   is   nice   and   soft   and   easy   for   her   to   hold .   she   is   5   months   now .
finding   baskets   to   fit   the   liners   is   a   great   problem !   the   liners   are   cute ,   but   i   expected   to   receive   baskets   along   with   them ,   too ...   do   you   happen   to   know   where   i   can   purchase   baskets   which   fit   those   small   liners   i   haven   t   had   any   luck   finding   such   neither   in   the   stores ,   nor   online ...   i   was   told   the   measurements   of   the   baskets   should   be   9x7x5 ,   but   there   is   no   place   i   know   of   that   sells   such   small   baskets .   i   have   lost   so   much   time   doing   a   research   in   my   last   days   of   pregnancy ...   it   is   frustrating .
great   fit !   it   fits   wonderfully   on   my   baby   trend   jogger   expedition   lx .   i   have   yet   to   use   it   in   the   rain ,   but   it   appears   that   all   important   areas   are   completely   covered   with   plastic   and   the   velcro   closes   tightly .
a   must   have   for   babies !   this   is   without   a   doubt   my   daughter   s   favorite   thing   in   the   world .   we   got   her   one   when   she   was   about   3   months   old   and   she   loved   it   from   the   start .   just   playing   with   those   tags   can   occupy   for   long   periods   of   time .   when   she   got   to   be   about   5   6   months   she   started   chewing   on   the   tags .   we   put   it   over   her   when   we   take   her   for   walks   or   in   her   infant   seat   in   the   car   she   never   seems   to   tire   of   it .   the   packaging   says   not   to   put   it   in   the   wash ,   but   i   do ,   and   it   has   held   up .
very   cute !   my   daughter   who   i   bought   this   for   isn   t   due   for   2   more   months ,   so   we   haven   t   actually   used   any   of   this   set   yet .   i   can   say   that   we   got   it   very   quickly   and   that   it   is   as   cute   as   if   not   cuter   than   the   picture .   i   plan   on   painting   the   room   a   girly   turquoise   color   that   i   think   will   go   really   well   with   the   colors   in   the   bedding !   as   a   shopper ,   i   would   have   liked   more   pictures   to   view   when   purchasing   this ,   but   i   am   very   happy   with   the   product   we   received .
leaked   i   was   really   excited   about   this   product   as   it   has   the   potential   for   the   batteries   to   be   replaced   yourself   unlike   the   other   turtle   thermometer .   after   a   short   time   ours   fogged   under   the   temperature   window   and   when   i   opened   it   up   the   wire   connections   had   corroded .   i   replaced   the   batteries   hoping   that   the   corrosion   was   too   minor   to   make   a   difference   but   after   that   it   just   stopped   working   all   together .
ju   ju   be   packabe   in   brown   bubblegum   i   received   this   item   and   was   disappointed   about   the   color .   the   strips   are   in   bright   pink   instead   of   the   more   plum   like   color   shown   on   the   website .   other   than   that ,   the   bag   is   nicely   constructed .
fun   house   mirror   i   ordered   this   mirror   thinking   i   could   use   it   with   a   rear   view   mirror   to   see   my   son   while   driving   in   the   car ,   but   it   s   not   a   real   mirror ...   it   s   like   a   fun   house   mirror   in   a   haunted   house   or   something .   it   s   actually   a   bit   scary   for   him   because   nothing   is   recognizable .   also ,   the   stand   is   flimsy ,   and   the   straps   are   too ,   making   it   hard   to   even   use   it   if   you   wanted   to .   i   m   returning   it .
grandamother   i   first   bought   these   for   my   three   month   old   granddaughter   which   she   loved .   one   day   when   her   9   month   old   cousin   came   over   for   a   visit   she   shared   one   of   her   teether   with   him   and   he   loved   it .   so   i   had   to   ordered   him   some .   they   have   other   teether   but   they   always   come   back   to   these .
shows   actual   temperature   and   is   very   cute !   i   got   this   for   when   my   daughter   moves   up   to   using   the   full   size   tub .   i   like   that   it   actually   shows   the   temperature   instead   of   just   hot   ,   etc .   it   appears   to   be   very   accurate ,   but   i   can   t   speak   to   its   durability   since   i   haven   t   really   used   it   consistently   yet   since   she   is   still   in   the   small   sink   tub   right   now   and   this   isn   t   quite   necessary   yet .   and   the   turtle   design   is   really   cute   too !
frustrated   baby ...   i   got   the   woombie   to   replace   a   miracle   blanket ,   which   my   3   month   old   daughter   is   growing   out   of   and   which   comes   only   in   newborn   3   month   size   .   i   was   so   hoping   it   ll   work ,   but   it   didn   t .   it   just   got   my   baby   frustrated   she   could   move   her   arms ,   got   her   hands   close   to   her   mouth ,   but   couldn   t   get   them   into   her   mouth   besides ,   i   think   her   arms   got   stuck   in   this   position ,   and   she   couldn   t   move   them   down   .   the   miracle   blanket   uses   two   levels   of   restraint   first   the   arms   get   pinned   down   alongside   the   body ,   then   the   baby   is   wrapped   all   around .   no   moving   arms   there .   my   daughter   loves   this   blanket ,   frequently   falls   asleep   on   her   own   some   times   after   5   min   of   fussing ,   sometimes   right   away   if   wakes   she   up   while   i   put   her   down ,   and   always   falls   back   asleep   if   she   wakes   up   in   the   middle   of   the   night   or   a   nap .   with   the   woombie ,   she   started   whimpering   when   i   put   her   down   and   the   whimpers   quickly   turned   into   crying ,   as   she   was   trying   to   get   her   arms   somewhere ,   where   they   wanted   to   go .   this   swaddling   blanket   is   supposed   to   mimic   the   womb .   well ,   maybe   if   you   start   using   it   on   a   newborn   and   then   graduate   to   the   larger   side   it   would   work .   but   by   3   months ,   perhaps ,   the   womb   experience   is   too   remote   for   the   baby   to   need   to   replicate   it .
not   what   i   expected .   nice   sturdy   toy ,   but   did   not   hold   the   baby   s   attention   for   long .   i   expected   more   from   baby   einstein   toys .   it   was   ok ,   but   nothing   to   write   home   about .
wonderful   double   stroller   i   was   somewhat   tentative   about   the   purchase   since   some   of   the   reviews   of   this   product   have   been   mixed .   our   main   stroller ,   the   uppa   baby   vista ,   we   love .   my   almost   3   year   old   son   is   at   the   weight   limit   35   lbs   for   the   additional   rumble   seat   to   make   the   vista   a   double   so   i   was   pressed   to   find   a   good   solution   for   our   newborn   and   toddler   that   would   last .   the   ergo   caboose   seems   to   be   it !   i   love   that   the   infant   car   seat   is   close   to   the   parent .   my   3   year   old   loves   to   ride   up   front   with   no   obstructions   to   his   view .   the   under   basket   is   large   and   fairly   easy   to   access .   the   stroller   maneuvers   well   definitely   harder   to   steer   than   our   uppa   baby   vista   but   not   bad   at   all   and   can   fit   into   most   spaces   a   traditional   double   cannot .   it   is   easy   to   fold   and   while   it   is   quite   heavy   to   lift   in   and   out   of   the   car ,   it   isn   t   terrible .   i   could   manage   it   3   weeks   postpartum   from   a   c   section   delivery .   the   stroller   looks   great   too ,   love   the   styling   and   love   that   this   is   something   that   will   last   for   several   years   for   us   the   weight   limit   and   seating   combinations   are   great .   i   really   like   it   so   far   and   am   glad   i   got   one !
i   want   one   too !   i   bought   this   blanket   for   my   two   year   old   for   her   cot   at   school   and   it   is   so   soft   and   plush   that   i   want   one   for   myself !   i   was   afraid   it   would   be   thin   and   small ,   but   it   larger   than   her   other   blankets   and   quite   thick .   the   design   is   adorable   and   goes   well   with   many   colors .   this   is   so   cute   i   m   thinking   about   changing   her   room   decor !   and   so   plush   i   am   looking   for   more   blankets   like   this   one   in   different   patterns .
love   baby   jogger !   a   gift   for   a   family   member   who   was   very   pleased   the   assembly   br   was   not   complicated .   she   loves   the   crimson   color   because   she   br   can   pick   out   her   stroller   easily   when   all   the   black   topped   ones   br   clutter   the   hallway   br   br   great   product !
so   cute   got   this   and   it   goes   excellent   with   the   eddie   bauer   teddy   bear   bedding   set .   very   stylish   good   choice   and   great   price
handy   little   bag .   this   is   a   surprisingly   useful   little   bag .   it   attaches   to   stroller   or   larger   bags .   it   keeps   my   diapers   organized   and   where   i   can   find   them   as   opposed   to   being   jammed   here   or   there .   it   s   a   very   good   size ,   not   so   large   as   to   be   bulky ,   not   so   small   as   to   not   hold   enough .   i   can   fit   in   around   10   diapers   size   six   and   four   ,   a   pack   of   wipes ,   and   a   toss   away   changing   liner   at   the   max   which   covers   almost   any   length   trip .   the   zipper   works   well   after   six   months   of   solid   use .   i   recommend   this   item .
get   this   before   it   s   gone !   discontinued   cute   item   if   you   are   lucky   to   find   this   available   grab   it !   it   is   almost   impossible   to   find   very   cute   and   goes   great   with   the   eddie   bauer   bedding   set .
peace   of   mind !   have   had   this   installed   on   my   8   months   crib   for   a   few   months   now ,   and   i   can   sleep   sound   at   night   because   of   these   bumpers .   she   is   such   a   wild   sleeper ,   but   these   don   t   move   when   she   kicks   or   tries   to   play   with   them .   great   product ,   they   take   a   little   while   to   get   properly   installed   though .
safety   hazard   i   tried   posting   the   same   review   somewhere   else   and   they   seemed   to   have   blocked   it ,   so   i   am   giving   it   another   go .   our   son   who   is   18months   and   weighs   a   little   over   20   lbs .   on   two   seperate   occasions   the   seat   slipped   out   of   the   slot   and   my   son   fell   out   of   the   chair .   i   would   not   recommend   this   product !   he   could   have   been   seriously   hurt ,   being   choked   by   the   straps   when   the   seat   fell   off   or   hitting   his   chin   on   the   seat .   miraculously   he   was   not   hurt   but   we   have   stopped   using   the   product .   also   i   would   like   to   add   that   this   product   does   not   hold   well   to   wear   and   tear .   we   have   had   our   highchair   for   maybe   a   little   over   a   year   and   we   have   scratches   all   over   it .
nice   fitted   diaper   i   have   been   cloth   diapering   my   15   month   old   since   the   beggining .   i   love   fitted   diapers .   the   design   of   the   buttons   is   interestnig ...   but   it   works .   i   love   the   removeable   insert ,   especially   for   drying .   overall ,   not   a   bad   deal ,   and   its   soft   against   his   skin   after   many   uses   and   trips   to   the   washer .
great   quality   toy   we   just   bought   the   small   wheely   pig   for   my   son   for   his   first   birthday .   he   is   a   bit   young   but   when   the   snow   melts ,   he   ll   be   old   enough   to   use   it   outside .   for   now ,   he   sits   on   the   floor   and   rolls   it   like   a   car .   he   also   loves   to   pull   the   tail   and   pat   its   head .   just   doing   that ,   he   has   given   his   wheely   a   lot   more   use   than   most   of   his   electronic   toys .   the   first   thing   i   noticed   is   how   sturdy   this   thing   is .   i   feel   like   i   could   sit   on   it   and   it   won   t   break .   the   price   tag   is   steep   but   you   can   t   get   this   kind   of   quality   from   plastic   toys .   it   will   last   you   several   years ,   even   with   a   rough   kid .   it   s   also   super   cute   and   very   appealing   visually   with   its   simple   design .   i   had   the   idea   in   my   head   that   the   child   is   supposed   to   have   their   legs   bent   a   little   in   order   to   scoot   it   around .   i   think   a   normally   sized   2   year   old   would   fit   this   just   fine   and   you   wouldn   t   need   the   larger   one .   my   son   is   in   the   90th   percentile   in   height   and   he   can   barely   touch   the   floor   on   the   small   he   can   t   scoot   it   even   if   he   tried .
happymom   cheap   and   poor   quality .   i   received   the   bibs   and   the   stitching   is   already   coming   off   without   even   using   washing   it   .   the   backs   are   also   made   out   of   a   cheap   plastic ,   which   i   do   not   like .   the   sayings   are   cute   but   do   not   buy   these   bibs .
wanted   to   love   it ....   i   should   preface   by   saying   that   i   have   nothing   to   compare   this   too   but   after   reading   reviews   this   seemed   to   be   the   best   one .   i   hated   the   idea   of   a   steel   beam   being   underneath   my   little   one   s   back   so   this   was   the   only   travel   crib   for   me .   we   used   it   for   over   a   week   when   we   were   visiting   relatives   for   thanksgiving   and   whilst   it   is   a   snap   to   get   set   up ,   it   does   become   wearing   to   keep   reaching   down   to   pick   up   and   put   down   a   baby .   our   little   boy   is   3.5   months   and   15lbs   and   by   the   end   of   the   week   my   back   was   killing   me .
perfect   this   was   to   convert   my   gate   to   go   on   my   banister ,   and   it   works   like   a   charm !   feels   safe   and   secure ,   doesn   t   slide   at   all ,   my   son   stands   on   the   other   side   and   rattles   it   and   nothing   happens .   yay !
good   product   i   bought   this   for   my   daughter   but   i   ended   up   giving   the   other   2   away   fo   2   friends   who   have   small   kids   like   me .   my   daughter   loves   elmo   so   this   product   really   helped   me   with   the   transition   from   bottle   to   cup .

wrong   product !   when   i   placed   a   order   to   buy   the   high   chair   all   the   information   i   had   was   about   the   double   pad ,   i   printed   the   page   and   i   can   still   see   the   following   chicco   polly   double   pad   highchair ,   however   when   i   got   the   high   chair   i   realized   i   was   misleading   by   the   amazon   site ,   because   they   sent   me   the   chicco   polly   high   chair   single   pad   cloth ,   hazelwood .   the   wrong   information   i   received   is   still   in   the   amazon   site ! ! ! !
great   musical   education   and   fun ,   too !   we   all   love   this   toy .   when   someone   presses   the   orchestra   button ,   a   new   song   starts .   then   you   can   add   or   subtract   instruments .   it   s   great   for   teaching   about   different   parts   harmony   melody   counterpoint   ,   different   sounds ,   and   some   classical   music .   or   just   listening   to   and   playing   with !   we   ve   had   ours   for   about   5   years   now ,   and   although   it   has   been   subjected   to   four   rough   and   tumble   kids ,   it   still   works   well .   it   has   been   dropped ,   and   even   though   the   battery   cover   piece   broke ,   we   got   a   replacement   through   the   company   and   it   s   back   in   use .   our   current   2   year   old   particularly   likes   to   drum   along   with   it .   loudly .   repeatedly .   rhythm ,   right  
bibsi   these   ate   cute   but   if   you   wash   them   an   accidently   dry   them   they   are   ruined .   they   are   not   durable   and   not   really   worth   the   money .
actually   baby   proof   my   son   quickly   learned   to   remove   the   traditional   style   plugs .   we   placed   these   in   the   eye   level   outlets .   sometimes   guests   come   over   and   even   the   adults   can   t   figure   out   how   to   take   them   off .
baby   squeals   with   delight !   we   ve   had   this   book   since   our   son   was   4   months   old   and   read   it   to   him   daily .   he   absolutely   loves   it !   he   s   now   8   months   old   and   squeals   with   pure   delight   whenever   we   say   peek   a   boo   and   reveal   what   s   behind   the   flap .   it   s   one   of   the   best   baby   purchases   we   ve   made .   i   really   like   that   it   s   cloth   so   it   stands   up   to   a   lot   of   punishment   unlike   the   board   books .   it   also   doesn   t   have   that   annoying   velcro   book   closure   like   some   of   the   other   cloth   books .
love   this   wrap !   i   just   bought   this   wrap   sling   and   i   adore   it !   i   was   having   a   hard   time   with   other   slings   so   i   bought   this   and   it   s   so   simple ,   so   comfortable ,   and   my   baby   loves   it !   nursing   in   it   is   so   easy   too .   the   best   wrap   sling   out   there !
amazon   needs   intelligent   people   making   descriptions ! ! ! ! !   these   nipples   are   not   slow   flow   first   essential   .   they   are   way   too   fast   for   a   newborn ,   or   even   a   4   month   old   baby .   i   m   very   tired   of   amazon   s   inept   product   descriptions   that   are   either   wrong   or   misleading .   br   now   i   have   to   spend   my   time   and   gas   money   to   take   these   back   to   ups   and   seal   back   up   the   package .   br   tell   us   exactly   what   the   product   is   br   show   us   the   exact   picture   of   the   product   br   send   us   the   right   product
favorite   toy   this   giraffe   is   my   son   s   favorite   toy   so   i   had   to   write   a   review .   he   is   12   weeks   old   now   and   just   loves   to   bat   at   the   four   different   toys   hanging   from   the   giraffe   s   legs .   each   toy   provides   a   different   sensory   experience   it   is   educational   and   keeps   him   interested .   my   son   has   now   started   to   grab   the   rings   and   the   other   toys   and   he   trys   to   put   them   in   his   mouth .   he   also   loves   to   look   at   the   giraffe   s   face   and   the   spots   on   his   body .   he   never   bores   of   this   giraffe   it   makes   him   so   happy !   really   this   is   just   a   great   toy   i   recommend   it   over   others   of   a   similar   character .
great   car   seat !   i   absolutely   love   this   car   seat !   it   s   sturdy   and   easy   to   use .   it   fits   in   our   smaller   sized   car   with   no   problem .   our   little   guy   is   super   comfortable   in   it .   the   only   thing   negative   thing   i   will   say   although ,   i   don   t   mind   being   5   1   and   lifting   it   in   to   our   suv ,   it   is   pretty   heavy .
jury   still   out   maybe   it   is   because   i   didn   t   read   the   manual ,   but   this   car   seat   is   hard   to   get   out   of   the   car !   it   requires   two   hands   to   unlock   it   and   then   the   baby   gets   jerked   from   the   movement .   would   not   buy   this   product   again   because   of   that .
my   son   loves   these !   my   son   was   breastfed   and   is   very   fussy   about   his   nipples   on   pacifiers   and   bottles .   he   loves   these ! after   trying   just   about   every   brand   i   found   these !   i   buy   them   whenever   i   see   them   in   a   store !   they   sanitize   well   too !   water   never   gets   inside   the   nipple .   they   seem   to   have   a   natural   fit   inside   the   mouth   of   a   youngster .   they   come   in   so   many   great   colors   and   designs   too !   he   has   one   to   match   just   about   anything   he   wears !   lol
protection   for   your   seat   backs !   i   have   two   grandchildren   7   3   and   have   had   this   brand   since   the   oldest   was   two .   through   natural   wear   i   had   to   replace   them   about   six   months   ago .   replaced   with   another   brand   that   just   did   not   do   the   job .   searched   and   found   the   original   i   had   used   and   working   like   a   charm !
love   it !   and   use   it   everywhere !   bought   this   before   my   first   baby   was   born ,   based   on   reviews   and   ended   up   loving   it !   it   s   a   smooth   ride   for   both   baby   and   i ,   and   definitely   can   handle   a   lot .   it   s   very   easy   to   fold   up   but   can   get   quite   heavy   constantly   putting   it   into   the   trunk   of   your   car   and   taking   it   out .   i   use   this   not   only   for   walking   jogging   but   also   at   malls ,   parks ,   etc .   i   can   fit   quite   a   bit   into   this   except   for   my   diaper   bag   which   can   become   annoying   b   c   the   bottom   storage   is   so   small .   however ,   i   just   take   out   the   essentials   from   the   diaper   bag   and   place   them   into   the   back   pockets   of   the   stroller .   reclines   almost   flat   for   baby   to   sleep ,   canopy   has   great   coverage   and   good   size   window ,   amazing   brakes   and   hand   brakes ,   etc .   my   only   complaint   would   be   the   weight   which   is   expected   i   suppose   and   the   lack   of   space   for   a   diaper   bag ,   a   small   diaper   bag .   otherwise ,   perfect   for   our   family .

jeep   renegade   walker   really   nice   walker ,   very   comfortable   for   any   baby !   the   colors   are   very   nice !   the   front   tires   turn   but   the   back   ones   don   t ,   maybe   it   would   be   even   more   fun   for   the   baby   if   the   back   ones   turned   also .   anyway   this   is   a   great   walker   and   my   daughter   has   alot   of   fun   with   it !
what   i   needed   and   i   get   asked   where   i   got   it   too   i   bought   it   in   the   silver   lavender   which   is   no   longer   an   available   color .   it   works   great   as   a   bag   for   taking   my   books ,   lunch ,   and   other   items   to   classes   with   me   and   doubles   as   an   oversized   purse .   it   has   pockets   for   my   cell   phone ,   credit   cards ,   checkbook ,   and   cash .   i   can   fit   quite   a   bit   of   stuff   in   it   and   my   classmates   have   said   to   me ,   where   did   you   get   it   i   want   one !   their   jaws   drop   when   i   tell   them   it   was   sold   as   a   diaper   bag ....   they   say   they   d   never   know   it .   it   looks   classy   and   could   double   easily   as   a   woman   s   briefcase   which   is   basically   what   i   use   it   for ...   a   purse   briefcase .   my   cats   seem   to   leave   it   alone ...   they   have   not   tried   to   shred   it   so   that   is   pleasing   too .   i   recommend   it   highly .
just   what   we   were   looking   for   this   walker   is   exactly   what   we   were   looking   for .   bright   colors ,   plenty   of   things   to   keep   baby   busy .   the   little   play   station   is   removable ,   not   by   baby   ,   to   reveal   a   tray   for   snacks ,   etc .   it   has   adjustable   heigth   so   it   will   grow   with   your   baby .   our   5   month   old   granddaughter   s   feet   could   touch   the   ground   on   the   lowest   setting .   she   was   able   to   move   it   within   minutes .   backwards ,   but   hey ,   she   moved   it .   it   moves   easy   but   i   can   see ,   with   the   brake   pads ,   it   will   have   a   problem   on   plush   carpet .   we   don   t   have   this   problem   due   to   low   pile   carpet   and   hard   wood   floors .   i   think   those   pads   are   there   as   extra   insurance   against   tip   over .   although   the   unit   seems   pretty   sure   footed   to   me .   i   m   sure ,   with   a   little   enginunity ,   the   plush   carpet   issue   can   be   handled .   it   folds   down   to   a   reasonably   small   size   for   travel .   i   need   to   mention   a   couple   of   things   that   will   help .   first ,   read   the   instructions .   they   re   easy   to   read   and   will   help   you .   check   twice   before   installing   the   cloth   seat .   i   put   it   on   inside   out   the   first   time .   and   the   little   rings   that   hold   the   seat   in   place   are   difficult   to   get   seated   in .   you   will   have   to   tug   pretty   hard   but   they   will   go   in   place .   the   little   brake   pads ,   you   will   know   what   i   m   talking   about   when   you   get   to   them .   they   fit   very   tight   but   must   be   completely   seated   of   they   will   not   let   the   walker   move .   i   ended   up   using   a   rubber   mallet   to   lightly   tap   them   in .   don   t   get   carried   away .   all   you   need   is   a   light   tap   or   two .   this   is   a   great   little   walker ,   your   baby   will   love   it .   one   more   thing ,   don   t   worry   if   your   baby   s   feet   wont   touch   the   ground   while   sitting .   he   or   she   will   soon   learn   to   scoot   forward   and   stand .   enjoy !
great   purchase !   sooo   cute ,   plenty   of   room ,   and   my   kids   love   to   use   them ! ! !   the   little   details   of   the   ears   and   trunk   are   super   cute   and ,   most   importantly   it   keeps   food   cold !
great   teether ,   too   expensive   my   ds   seems   to   really   enjoy   teething   on   sophie   .   its   a   very   cute   toy   and   does   everything   it   is   discribes .   i   just   think   its   way   over   priced   for   the   product .
excellent   quality   i   love   this   dresser ! ! ! !   i   love   the   color ,   style ,   everything   about   it .   purchased   it   for   my   baby   it   can   definitely   be   used   for   years   to   come .   not   just   baby   furniture .   hubby   said   it   was   very   easy   to   put   together   he   was   surprised   at   the   high   quality .
bad   quality ,   not   so   good   looking   and   does   not   fit   pad   yes   they   re   cheap   but   the   quality   of   the   fabric   is   really   poor   and   it   does   not   look   very   good   also   it   is   so   thin   that   i   am   not   sure   that   it   would   make   a   difference   to   a   a   cover   or   not   i   d   rather   put   a   towel   underneath   my   baby   also   i   had   purchased   the   la   baby   4   sided   pad   and   these   covers   don   t   fit   well   at   all .   so   i   had   to   return   them .
this   fits   perfectly   in   my   graco   pack   n   play   this   pad   fits   perfectly   in   my   graco   pack   n   play .   we   take   it   on   road   trips   so   the   pack   n   play   is   a   lot   softer   for   our   baby   to   sleep   in .   it   goes   great   with   the   american   baby   waterproof   fitted   quilted   mattress   pad .
gumdrop   pacifier   used   this   passy   for   both   kids ... and   both   loved   them !   i   love   the   fact   that   they   have   space   for   nose ... always   hated   that   the   soothie   passy   given   to   me   at   the   hospital   covered   the   nose .   only   issue   i   had   with   this   passy   was   with   my   first   son ... the   inside   piece   broke   after   being   steped   on   and   punctured   the   outside   of   passy ... allowing   water   to   get   inside   and   mildew !   after   i   ordered   this ... i   found   out   that   they   are   now   being   sold   at   walmart ... with   my   first   baby ... i   was   only   able   to   find   them   on   line .   friend   got   me   the   first   one !
must   have ! ! ! !   i   never   knew   these   existed   until   i   came   across   a   baby   message   board   everyone   was   recommending   them .   my   baby   couldn   t   keep   a   regular   pacifier   in   his   mouth ,   they   kept   falling   out .   this   was   the   best   solution .   soft   for   them   to   hold   onto   the   perfect   weight   to   rest   on   their   chest   while   they   re   sleeping .   love   that   they   re   washable   no   dryer ,   air   dry   .   his   has   been   bathed   several   times .
super   cute   and   functional   this   is   great   for   bedtime   because   ithe   elephant   can   be   made   to   sit   so   it   stays   in   my   daughters   mouth   better .   it   s   very   cute   too !
do   not   use   these   are   the   abesolute   worst ! ! !   my   son   almost   choked   on   these   pacifiers ,   it   was   down   his   throat ,   thank   god   we   were   sitting   there .   they   are   two   small   and   bend ! ! !   br   br   do   not   use   them ! ! !
still   workin   great   after   being   dropped   in   water   as   new   parents   we   purchased   this   video   monitor   on   amazon   in   early   2010 .   the   audio   video   quality   was   very   good   too   sharp   you   can   even   hear   the   slightest   noise   made   by   the   baby   .   the   frequency   range   is   excellent   too .   one   time   i   had   to   go   down   to   pick   up   something   from   the   car   and   my   baby   was   sleeping   in   the   3rd   floor   and   so   i   took   the   monitor   with   me .   being   in   the   ground   floor   i   was   still   able   to   watch   my   baby   sleep   with   no   difficulties   in   the   video   audio .   i   would   have   given   it   5   stars   then ,   but   i   forgot   to   write   the   review .   one   day   i   accidently   dropped   the   monitor   into   the   bath   tub   and   i   freaked   out ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !   i   immediately   removed   the   batteries ,   wiped   out   clean   and   let   it   dry   in   the   sun   for   a   few   hours .   i   checked   the   monitor   to   see   if   it   was   working   and   it   still   worked   great   with   the   same   excellent   quality ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !   i   never   really   thought   it   would   work   and   i   was   already   cursing   myself   for   the   mistake   i   did .   this   happened   in   june   2011   and   now   even   after   6   months ,   its   workin   fine .   i   decided   its   definitely   time   to   write   a   good   review   and   here   it   is !   we   still   use   it   everyday   and   its   definitely   one   of   the   best   purchases   we   ve   made .   best   video   monitor ! ! !
love   the   swing   my   daughter   has   loved   this   swing   since   she   was   born   1   month   old   today   .   we   use   it   everyday !   i   love   that   you   can   turn   it   in   3   different   directions   too .   the   base   is   about   3   feet   wide   so   you   have   to   have   an   area   large   enough   for   it   to   fit .   would   recommend .
a   great   toothbrush   fro   my   son .   he   loves   it   my   son ,   who   is   10   months   old ,   immediately   knows   how   to   use   it .   he   never   likes   cares   any   of   teething   toys ,   i   bought   about   10   different   shape   teething   toys ,   i   bought   for   him . therefore ,   i   was   a   little   bit   worry   that   he   will   not   like   this   training   toothbrush .   after   read   all   the   reviews ,   i   decided   to   give   it   a   shot .   he   just   loves   it   at   the   very   1st   time   i   gave   to   him .   the   brush   is   soft   enough   for   his   baby   gum   and   the   handles   were   so   easy   for   him   to   grape   and   bend . actually ,   i   am   thinking   to   get   another   one   just   in   case   we   lose   this   one . i   will   defiantly   recommend   this   product   to   all   my   friends .
great !   these   pants   work   well   and   are   not   too   bulky   under   clothes .   no   leaks   yet   and   we   ve   been   out   shopping   in   them .   they   wash   up   well   and   my   2   year   old   daughter   likes   the   designs .   she   is   able   the   pull   them   up   and   down   too .
just   as   expected   i   love   this   diaper   bag ,   it   is   a   generous   size   and   fits   all   my   baby   s   essentials .   the   pattern   is   beautiful   and   the   colors   are   just   as   pictured .   this   bag   is   very   sturdy   and   well   made ,   the   only   thing   i   noticed   was   that   there   was   a   bit   of   foam   sticking   out   of   the   stitching   on   the   changing   pad .   no   biggie ,   i   trimmed   it   off   and   it   looks   good   it   serves   it   purpose .   the   smaller   bag   that   came   with   it   is   an   excellent   size   also .   i   got   the   idea   from   another   review   and   had   my   daughters   name   embroidered   on   it .   it   looks   like   nothing   else   i   had   seen   in   local   stores   and   i   get   compliments   on   it   all   the   time .   this   is   a   great   buy   and   they   have   so   many   different   patterns   and   colors   to   choose   from   that   i   m   going   to   order   another .   i   would   definitely   recommend   this   product .
surprise !   none   available .
terrible   bag   was   fine   when   we   left   it   at   the   door   of   the   plane ,   when   we   arrived   at   our   destination ,   it   was   outside   the   door   of   the   plane   busted   open   at   the   seem .   even   if   it   didn   t   burst   open ,   it   is   very   hard   to   carry ,   a   should   strap   would   really   help ,   not   a   small   handle   like   it   has
the   mane   is   falling   apart .   this   is   soooo   cute ,   but   the   mane   is   coming   off   and   i   don   t   think   i   can   fix   it .   for   the   price ,   i   wish   it   had   held   up   a   lot   better .   we   ve   had   this   less   than   a   month   and   it   hasn   t   been   mistreated .   my   babies   like   it   a   lot   and   it   functions   for   it   s   purpose .   we   also   have   the   pink   elephant   and   it   has   held   up   really   well .   just   disappointed   with   the   mane .
had   to   throw   it   away   unfortunately   i   had   to   throw   this   away .   i   couldn   t   even   donate   it   because   it   is   a   hazard .   the   neck   is   huge ,   making   the   whole   gown   dangerous !   my   baby   is   wearing   6   month   clothing   and   this   is   supposedly   newborn   size .   last   night   he   was   wearing   it   and   i   checked   on   him   only   to   find   that   one   arm   was   completely   out   of   the   sleeve   and   had   gone   up   through   the   huge   neck   whole .   not   my   idea   of   a   safe   piece   of   clothing   for   baby !   into   the   trash   it   went !   i   m   bummed   because   i   love   gowns   and   i   hate   wasting   things ,   but   there   you   have   it !
perfect   toy   this   is   one   awesome   toy   at   an   awesome   price . its   a   great   alternative   to   the   40   bar   you   have   to   buy   seperately   for   the   bjourn   babysitter   balance . as   you   know   by   now , it   fits   on   almost   any   seat . i   use   mine   on   her   swing , toddler   chair , carseat   and   bjourn . its   flexible   so   that   it   can   be   adjusted   to   sit   wider   or   higher . it   can   be   adjusted   to   tilt   forward   or   back . this   is   due   to   the   ball   joints . it   seems   durable   and   is   secure . my   baby   loves   it .   that   said , the   toys   could   be   better   quality . they   are   lightweight   and   have   crinkle   paper   inside   that   babies   love . the   vecro   is   a   joke . a   baby   will   rip   them   off   with   less   than   moderate   force . the   ball   for   the   fan   is   the   only   toy   that   is   fixed .   they   should   have   used   heavy   duty   velcro   and   more   of   it .   the   good   thing   is   the   toys   can   be   replaced   with   ones   you   already   have . it   has   loops .   id   definately   buy   again   and   highly   recommend .
the   perfect   gift   for   families !   i   ve   purchased   a   few   of   these   sets   for   family   gifts ,   newborn   gifts ,   and   baby   shower   gifts .   everybody   loved   the   zatswho .   it   s   a   great   gift ,   unique   and   certainly   affordable !
horrible !   i   fell   in   love   with   the   boutique   look   of   these   cloth   diapers   when   i   first   saw   them .   i   also   liked   how   they   were   a   bit   narrower   than   the   bum   genius   diapers   since   my   daughter   is   tiny .   however ,   after   using   these   for   a   few   months ...   they   are   worthless .   the   outer   material   absorbs   the   urine   as   soon   as   it   wets   the   liner .   my   daughter   had   wet   pants   after   45   minutes   of   wearing   these   diapers   yesterday .   these   are   now   the   diapers   i   only   wear   on   her   around   the   house ,   knowing   they   probably   wont   last   longer   than   an   hour  
lite   and   easy   this   is   really   a   great   umbrella   stroller ,   i   actually   have   two   of   them .   its   so   lite   weight   and   easy   to   fold   up   and   put   in   car .   and   i   love   that   it   comes   with   a   rain   cover .
great   quality   for   the   price   we   went   with   this   mattress   since   the   price   was   so   great   and   the   reviews   were   mostly   good .   you   can   tell   that   it   isn   t   a   100   mattress   but   the   quality   is   good   for   the   price .   also   it   was   a   nice   snug   fit   in   our   delta   brand   crib   so   we   didn   t   have   any   issues   with   it   being   too   short .
saved   my   sanity !   i   couldn   t   handle   putting   my   bathroom   products   away   one   more   time !   the   plastic   products   broke   and   i   was   trying   to   stretch   my   own   rubber   bands   around   my   cupboards   which   wasn   t   working   well .   the   cords   are   really   easy   to   use   and   durable !   my   perfume   and   lotion   bottles   are   finally   safe   and   i   can   leave   my   bathroom   door   open   once   again !
my   baby   i   was   very   happy   with   this   bath   tub ,   works   good   for   a   half   year . i   wish   could   be   more   strong   so   could   last   long .
so   so   the   labels   that   came   with   them   weren   t   even   sticky .   ended   up   throwing   them   away   and   just   writing   on   the   dividers   with   a   permanent   marker .   very   disappointing !
the   right   choice   like   many   other   people   that   purchased   the   city   select ,   i   spent   alot   of   time   researching   double   strollers .   at   first   i   was   looking   at   the   more   affordable   options   like   the   joovy   ultralight ,   or   the   kolocraft   contours   both   of   which   got   excellent   reviews   as   well   .   however ,   i   knew   that   my   2   year   old   would   not   be   able   to   stay   seated   in   a   bench   and   still   likes   to   fall   asleep   in   the   stroller   ruling   out   the   joovy   ,   and   the   kolocraft   was   just   too   large   and   i   didn   t   want   to   be   stuck   with   a   double   since   my   other   one   would   eventually   out   grow   it   in   a   bit .   this   lead   to   looking   at   the   more   expensive   options .   it   came   down   to   the   britax   b   ready   and   the   city   select .   i   must   have   read   and   watched   almost   every   review   on   these   two   strollers   that   exist   on   the   internet ,   and   they   all   lead   me   to   the   same   place ..   they   are   both   great   strollers .   i   knew   i   would   just   have   to   go   check   them   out   in   person .   the   main   drawback   of   the   city   select   is   that   the   seats   are   smaller .   however   the   b   ready   only   has   one   larger   seat   and   the   second   seat   is   smaller .   what   i   ultimately   did   not   like   about   the   b   ready   is   the   position   of   the   second   add   on   seat .   knowing   my   2   year   old ,   she   wants   to   be   able   to   see   everything   so   being   so   far   near   the   ground   wasn   t   going   to   work .   i   also   liked   the   tires   on   the   city   select   a   lot   better .   the   b   ready   tires   did   not   have   any   tread .   the   drawback   of   the   city   select   is   the   price ,   since   baby   jogger   items   are   never   eligible   for   discounts   and   rarely   ever   go   on   sale .   however ,   i   was   able   to   nab   mine   at   a   great   price   on   black   friday   where   amazon   had   it   10   off ,   i   also   used   my   baby   registry   completion   discount   of   10   off   on   top   of   this   and   used   a   50   off   code   for   strollers   i   received   on   my   amazon   kindle .   it   was   still   expensive   to   me ,   especially   with   the   second   seat   and   carseat   adaptor   addons   but   at   least   i   was   able   to   save   quite   a   bit !   i   used   the   stroller   a   bunch   this   past   weekend ,   at   the   mall   and   to   do   some   christmas   shopping .   i   loved   it   and   so   did   my   kids   infant   and   2   year   old   .   it   isa   little   hard   to   turn   because   of   the   weight   and   the   length ,   but   it   is   a   really   nice   smooth   ride .   my   2   year   old   loved   to   sit   in   the   seat   in   the   front .   the   large   canopies   are   awesome .   it   is   pretty   heavy ,   but   that   s   a   given   already   and   shoudln   t   be   a   surprise   to   anybody .   it   s   easy   to   take   apart   and   put   together   each   time ,   but   you   do   need   quite   a   bit   of   trunk   space   for   it .   also   the   fact   that   it   can   easily   convert   from   a   single   to   a   double   is   awesome .   at   one   point   i   stayed   in   the   car   with   my   newborn   and   my   mom   was   able   to   take   my   2   year   old   shopping   in   the   stroller   as   just   a   single ,   how   convenient !   all   in   all ,   so   far   i   m   really   happy   with   my   purchase .   it   s   a   really   solid   stroller   that   i   m   sure   will   last   me   a   very   very   long   time .   do   your   research   and   know   what   you   need   it   for .
son   not   hurt   in   rollover   on   nov   19 ,   2011 ,   we   had   a   major   accident .   my   truck   2006   dodge   ram   1500   slid   on   ice   and   went   off   the   road .   the   truck   ramped   a   driveway   in   the   middle   of   the   ditch ,   and   rolled   twice   before   landing   upright .   other   than   being   a   little   upset ,   my   3   yr   old   was   completely   fine .   no   concussion ,   bruises ,   whiplash ,   absolutely   nothing .   considering   my   truck   was   a   total   loss   according   to   insurance ,   that   none   of   us   were   seriously   injured   is   a   miracle .   i   am   forever   grateful   that   i   bought   this   car   seat ,   and   am   using   the   replacement   money   to   purchase   again .

highly   recommended   i   ordered   this   mattress   to   go   in   a   portable   crib   that   i   purchased   from   a   daycare .   it   has   a   snug   fit ,   as   it   should ,   and   seems   very   comfortable .   i   am   very   happy   with   this   purchase !
best   teether   ever   my   daughter   never   liked   pacifiers ,   but   this   one   has   found   a   new   life   as   her   favorite   thing   to   chew   on   since   she   was   5   months   old   now   7   months   .   the   handle   makes   it   perfect   for   her   to   hold   and   manipulate .   parents   should   be   aware   that   although   rare ,   some   children   have   latex   allergies .
will   make   a   great   gift   i   bought   this   for   my   mom   for   her   birthday .   i   just   received   it   and   i   love   it .   it   s   very   clean   and   the   cutest   little   sheep .   i   will   update   this   when   my   mom   opens   it   and   tell   what   she   thinks   as   well .
a   must   have   great   price   for   two   bags ,   one   is   very   small ,   used   to   hold   two   or   three   pacis ,   i   use   mine   to   hold   eye   drops ,   chapstick ,   tissues ,   wet   naps ,   and   glucose   tabs .   the   large   one   isn   t   something   i   d   use   to   hold   a   whole   days   worth   of   dirty   diapers   but   when   i   m   out   of   town   for   then   evening   it   can   hold   4   maybe   5   if   i   roll   them   up   prefolds   and   insert   together   well .   and   it   keeps   the   smell   in   very   well   too !   wish   it   did   zipper   instead   of   tie   though .   br   br   edit   after   a   year   of   use   i   still   use   this   product ,   i   lost   the   smaller   bag   a   while   ago ,   but   still   use   the   large   one ,   it   did   tear   at   the   seam   where   the   ties   are ,   and   i   have   yet   to   fix   it ,   but   use   it   none   the   less !   keeps   the   stink   in   very   well !

hard   plastic   cut   baby   s   neck   i   am   so   disappointed   with   this   product .   i   purchased   4   of   these   bibs   and   i   couldn   t   understand   why ,   when   i   put   this   on   my   4   month   old   baby   he   screamed   so   bad .   i   assumed   it   was   the   resistance   other   reviews   discussed ,   to   the   hard   plastic   bib   rather   than   the   soft   one .   later   that   night   my   husband   was   bathing   him   and   noticed   a   wound   on   the   back   of   his   neck .   the   next   day   i   put   the   bib   on   again   and   and   he   started   to   scream .   after   further   evaluation   i   noticed   that   the   point   where   the   bib   connects ,   was   cutting   into   his   skin   exactly   where   the   wound   was .   i   immediately   stopped   using   the   product .   it   has   been   3   months   since   discontinuing   the   use   of   the   product   and   my   baby   still   had   a   scar   on   the   back   of   his   neck   from   this   bib .   i   wouldn   t   recommend   this   to   anyone ! !
almost   my   favorite   baby   product   purchase ...   the   bundleme   is   a   great   idea   and   is   executed   almost   perfectly .   the   only   issue   is   that   when   the   wind   blows ,   the   top   of   the   blanket   where   it   can   t   be   zipped   up   any   further   covers   up   my   son   s   face .   i   continually   have   to   stop   walking   to   uncover   his   face .   if   you   have   a   plastic   stroller   cover ,   then   this   shouldn   t   be   an   issue .   the   bundleme   is   otherwise   a   great   product .   so   much   easier   to   unzip   the   bundleme   than   deal   with   putting   on   and   removing   a   winter   coat .   the   product   fits   very   well   with   my   schwinn   turismo   single   jogging   stroller .   overall ,   i   would   definitely   recommend   the   product .
my   daughter   loves   her   new   car   seat   we   had   a   britax   in   europe ,   so   i   decided   to   buy   another   one   for   the   us .   my   daughter   loves   this   seat   and   seems   to   be   really   comfortable   in   it .   i   read   some   reviews   saying   installation   was   difficult   but   i   didn   t   find   that   to   be   true   at   all .   i   ve   used   it   both   with   the   seatbelt   and   latch   system   and   both   were   fairly   easy   to   do .
the   pros   far   out   weigh   the   cons   i   bought   this   crib   tent   when   my   two   year   old   started   trying   to   get   out   of   her   crib .   once   she   knew   she   could   do   it ,   bedtime   became   a   nightmare .   i   didn   t   think   she   was   mature   enough   to   stay   in   a   toddler   bed .   and   i   was   having   a   terrible   time   sleeping   myself   worrying   that   she   would   get   out   of   her   crib   and   would   have   free   rein   in   the   house .   i   was   concerned   by   some   of   the   reviews   saying   it   was   poorly   constructed ,   but   i   was   desperate .   i   have   to   say   i   love   it !   my   daughter   things   it   s   great   when   i   put   her   in   it ,   she   ll   even   lift   the   flap   for   me   to   zip   it   sometimes .   she   fusses   when   it   s   time   to   lay   down .   but   that   s   the   same   with   the   tent   or   without .   she   seems   to   fall   asleep   more   quickly   with   the   tent .   i   m   guessing   that   s   partly   because   she   can   t   throw   her   comfort   items   blanket ,   lovey   and   seahorse   out ,   and   partly   because   she   knows   she   really   doesn   t   have   another   option .   instead   of   trying   to   get   out   of   the   crib ,   she   just   lays   down .   i   will   agree   the   instructions   could   be   better .   it   took   me   longer   than   i   would   have   liked   to   put   it   together .   as   for   those   with   the   zipper   troubles ,   i   almost   wonder   if   they   had   the   velcro   too   tight .   i   know   the   first   couple   of   times   i   zipped   and   unzipped   it ,   i   was   really   concerned .   it   was   like   zipping   up   luggage   that   was   too   full .   but   when   i   loosened   the   velcro   holding   it   to   the   front   rail ,   the   zipper   action   was   much   smoother .   i   have   only   had   it   for   6   weeks .   so   i   can   not   speak   to   it   s   long   term   durability .   but   so   far   i   am   pleased .   the   biggest   cons   i   have   with   this   crib   tent   would   be   that   the   zipper   is   loud .   i   usually   take   out   her   musical   seahorse ,   and   cover   her   up   before   i   go   to   bed .   i   try   to   be   as   quiet   as   i   can ,   but   it   sometimes   makes   her   stir .   thankfully   it   hasn   t   woken   her   up   yet .   the   other   con   is   using   it   with   a   video   baby   monitor .   the   mesh   makes   it   hard   for   the   monitor   camera   to   see   in   the   crib .   i   had   to   move   the   camera   several   times   before   finding   somewhere   that   gave   me   a   reasonable   view .   for   us ,   the   pros   of   this   product   far   outweigh   the   cons .   sleep   is   a   precious   commodity   at   our   house .   it   was   worth   every   penny   we   paid   for   this   crib   tent   for   her   to   get   better   sleep ,   thereby   allowing   me   to   get   better   sleep .
love   this   dresser   why   are   people   giving   this   dresser   a   bad   review   i   ordered   this   dresser   over   a   year   ago   for   myself   not   a   child   because   of   the   price   i   m   on   a   tight   budget   .   i   wasn   t   really   sure   what   to   expect   when   i   ordered   it   considering   the   low   price   my   old   dresser   had   cost   almost   as   much   as   this   dresser   and   had   been   made   of   very   cheap   materials   so   i   was   pleasantly   surprised   when   i   received   it .   the   dresser   wasn   t   difficult   to   assemble .   it   s   very   nice   looking   my   old   dresser   looked   cheap   ,   it   s   very   sturdy   my   old   dresser   wasn   t   ,   and   the   drawers   have   plenty   of   space   for   my   clothes   socks ,   underwear ,   pajamas ,   t   shirts ,   light   sweaters   .
save   yourself   frustration   these   are   a   great   idea   at   first   glance   save   time ,   save   plastic   baggies ,   save   energy ,   save   the   planet ,   etc . ,   but   they   are   a   total   frustration .   i   bought   both   the   goodbyn   bynto   snack   box ,   which   is   a   smaller   version   of   the   original   goodbyn   ,   and   the   original   goodbyn .   the   bynto   has   worked   fine ,   but   the   original   bigger   goodbyn   box   is   way   too   big   for   the   normal   kid   size   lunch   in   my   opinion .   i   was   so   aggravated   because   the   first   day   i   sent   it   in   with   my   son   to   school   second   grader   ,   the   lid   was   not   closed   all   the   way   after   he   ate   what   was   inside   for   lunch   and   the   whole   thing   splatted   apart   in   his   backpack   with   a   huge   mess .   it   looks   great ,   but   is   awkwardly   heavy   and   oblong ,   is   not   easy   to   open   and   close ,   and   is   embarrasingly   messy   when   not   closed   all   the   way ,   dropped   and   explodes   everywhere   with   lunch   remnant   leftovers .... i   actually   wrote   an   apology   note   to   my   son   s   teacher   i   felt   so   bad   about   the   hassle   and   mess   it   created ,   like   his   teacher   needs   another   mess   to   deal   with   along   with   a   room   full   of   wired   second   graders   each   day   at   lunchtime ...   .   so ,   once   again ,   for   home   use   it   s   great ,   but   i   would   not   recommend   buying   it   and   sending   it   to   school   for   a   smaller   child   to   use   independently   each   day .
it   broke   first   day .   it   broke   first   day .   i   emailed   the   company   they   told   me   contact   where   you   buy   and   i   contact   jr . com   but   they   dont   relpy   yet   and   i   dont   have   time   for   to   call   them   ship   them   etc ..   so   i   need   to   buy   a   new   one   and   it   wont   be   kidsline   for   sure .   so   if   your   time   valuable   then   don   t   buy   this   brand   it   may   brake   easily   and   you   have   to   spend   sometime   to   fix   it .
cute   convenient   the   design   is   cute ,   although   i   wish   i   could   have   picked   which   design   i   would   get .   the   pictures   display   4   different   styles ,   and   i   thought   it   was   showing   front   back   photos .   aside   from   that ,   these   bags   are   durable   completely   serves   their   purpose .   i   m   confident   that   the   draw   string   closure   won   t   bust   any   time   soon .   it   s   made   out   of   very   good   materials .   they   re   definitely   on   the   go   bags ,   meaning   they   re   not   very   big   at   all .   they   still   fit   quite   a   few   cloth   diapers   inserts   inside !
one   of   the   best   teethers   you   an   buy   this   teething   ring   was   purchased   to   replace   an   almost   identical   one   that   we   bought   for   our   first   son   and   which   was   loved   by   him ,   our   new   son   and   their   cousin .   the   wings   are   just   the   right   size   to   fit   into   a   baby   s   mouth   unlike   big   round   teething   rings   that   are   always   too   large   to   get   right   to   the   back   of   the   gums   where   it   really   seems   to   hurt   them .   also ,   the   materials   are   soft   chewy   plastic   rather   than   some   of   the   much   harder   plastics   you   often   see .   only   downside   is   that   the   first   version   of   this   that   we   bought   had   a   yellow   and   black   body   which   looked   more   ike   a   bee   and   which   both   of   our   sons   seemed   to   be   attracted   too   more   than   this   stripey   green   body .   sassy ,   why   have   u   discontinued   this   product   its   virtually   impossible   to   get   anywhere   now .
large   but   not   absorbent ,   too   thin   the   size   is   nice ,   it   s   larger   than   many   burp   cloths   on   the   market .   but   it   wouldn   t   need   to   be   so   large   if   it   were   actually   absorbent   it   s   extremely   thin   and   the   spit   up   either   runs   off   or   just   goes   right   through   to   my   shoulder .   either   buy   the   gerber   cloths ,   or   spend   the   extra   money   on   the   eden   anais   burp   cloths .
cute   mobile   i   guess   in   my   post   natal   fog   i   didn   t   realize   this   was   supposed   to   suction   cup   to   the   car   window .   no   matter ,   the   little   guys   are   attached   with   velcro   loops   so   i   just   took   them   off   and   put   them   on   the   car   seat   handle .   baby   stares   at   them   for   hours !
not   impressed   i   bought   these   before   our   son   was   born   because   1   they   were   cute   and   2   the   nip   looked   as   close   to   the   real   thing   i   could   find .   i   have   been   using   them   for   a   few   months   now   and   am   not   very   impressed .   first ,   the   name   of   them   is   suitable   because   they   are   so   top   heavy   that   they   tip   over   all   the   time .   the   bottles   are   also   hard   to   clean   since   there   is   an   apprecable   lip   inside   the   bottle   that   collects   residue   that   i   can   t   seem   to   get   with   the   bottle   brush .   i   end   up   putting   my   fingers   in   there   and   cleaning   it .   lastly ,   they   are   incredibly   expensive .   i   won   t   be   buying   them   again   and   will   instead   be   switching   back   to   avent   which   we   used   with   our   first   baby   with   no   problems   .   the   great   thing   about   avent   is   you   can   use   a   little   adapter   available   and   turn   them   into   sippy   cups .
not   musical ,   but   great !   there   is   no   music   as   stated   in   the   title .   on   the   plus   side ,   that   means   no   batteries   to   replace .   i   absolutely   love   this   toy !   it   is   flexible   and   adjustable   and   hooks   to   just   about   anything .   i   have   used   it   on   the   swing ,   bouncy   seat ,   bassinet   and   car   seat   and   will   use   it   on   the   stroller   and   high   chair   soon .   it   is   easy   to   attach   hook   on   the   claws   and   turn   the   knobs   to   tighten .   it   has   a   lot   of   joints   in   it   so   you   can   tilt   it   forward   or   back ,   make   it   flatter   or   taller .   that   way ,   it   is   always   in   the   perfect   position   for   baby   to   reach .   the   toys   that   hang   down   are   removable .   the   sun   is   really   cute   and   my   baby   loves   to   stare   at   it .   all   in   all ,   a   great   toy   for   a   good   price !
disappointed   in   size   i   got   this   as   a   backup   for   my   son .   he   has   a   blue   bear   with   brown   polka   dots   by   blanket   and   beyond .   loves   it .   was   ecstatic   when   i   saw   this   online .   ordered   it   and   was   so   disappointed ...   his   is   large .   the   blanket   portion   is   big .   this   one   was   small   and   was   like   a   cone   so   to   speak ...   didn   t   open   up   flat .   super   cute   but   not   the   same   thing .
snoopy   border   i   have   never   put   up   wall   paper   before   so   i   was   a   little   nervous .   the   wall   paper   was   easier   than   i   thought .   just   use   a   lot   of   water   and   it   will   come   out   fine .   it   took   us   a   little   less   than   an   hour   to   put   up   the   border   all   around   our   nursery .   it   looks   great   and   matches   the   crib   set   and   valances   perfectly .   i   would   highly   recommend   to   everyone .
inflatable   spout   guard   this   is   the   second   spout   guard   i   purchased .   the   first   was   hard   plastic   and   kept   falling   off   the   spout   totally   defeating   the   purpose   of   buying   it   in   the   first   place .   this   one   is   so   much   better .   it   fits   very   snug   creating   a   very   safe   spout .   my   22   month   old   granddaughter   loves   to   play   with   the   water   flowing   from   the   spout   and   now   i   don   t   have   to   worry   about   her   hitting   her   head .   i   am   completely   happy   with   my   purchase   and   would   recommend   it   to   anyone   interested   in   creating   a   safe   environment   for   little   ones .

better   than   i   expected !   my   husband   and   i   bought   this   for   our   2   month   old   who   has   been   having   problems   going   to   sleep   at   night   and   seems   to   hate   the   dark .   after   sleeping   with   a   light   or   tv   on   we   wanted   to   get   some   type   of   night   light .   i   was   weary   of   this   since   it   doesn   t   play   music   and   it   looked   kind   of   generic   to   me .   however   this   is   the   best   thing   we   ve   bought   our   son   yet .   the   first   time   turning   it   on ,   his   eyes   lit   up   and   he   got   really   excited .   we   use   it   every   night   now   and   turn   it   back   on   during   our   middle   of   the   night   feedings .   he   immediately   looks   up   in   awe   and   starts   to   get   sleepy   again .   i   ve   put   this   on   a   shelf ,   on   the   floor ,   and   even   in   his   bassinet   when   he   wasn   t   in   it   and   it   s   always   worked   perfectly .   for   the   amber   glow   to   work   you   need   a   very   dark   room ,   but   hey   that   s   what   the   middle   of   the   night   is .   the   amber   glow   also   seems   to   be   the   most   calming   and   puts   him   to   sleep   quickly .   worth   every   penny !   highly   recommend   for   infants   who   are   fussy   about   going   to   sleep   at   night .
much   better   than   expected .   so   far   this   video   monitoring   system   has   performed   above   my   expectations .   after   reading   some   of   the   other   reviews   i   was   worried .   yes ,   the   movement   alarm   will   sound   every   other   second   when   you   first   turn   it   on ..   there   s   a   dial   on   the   camera   labelled   sensitivity   that   needs   to   be   adjusted   properly   or   disabled   before   you   use   the   system .   the   only   thing   that   surprised   me ,   but   in   retrospect   shouldn   t   have ,   was   that   in   order   to   use   skype   you   have   to   have   the   video   monitor   attached   to   a   pc .   i   didn   t   read   that   anywhere   before   purchasing ,   but   it   makes   sense .   it   s   pretty   cool   that   the   monitor   acts   as   a   wireless   video   camera   for   chatting .   it   shows   up   as   a   normal   webcam .   the   temperature   does   read   as   warmer   than   it   should ,   but   this   can   be   taken   into   consideration   when   setting   temperature   based   alarms .   for   me   it   s   not   anywhere   near   the   10   degrees   off   that   others   reported .
18   month   old   crying   because   it   doesn   t   work !   i   paid   more   money   for   these   cups   thinking   they   would   work   well ,   i   ve   only   had   them   a   week   and   am   so   disappointed .   my   18   month   old   screams   everytime   i   give   her   the   cup   because   she   cannot   get   anything   out   of   them .   i   have   taken   them   apart   and   put   them   back   together   several   times ,   but   it   never   seems   to   be   right .   it   breaks   my   heart   to   hear   her   cry   because   she   is   unable   to   drink   the   milk .   i   tried   myself   several   times   and   am   surprised   at   how   difficult   it   is   to   get   the   drink   out .   i   am   thoroughly   disappointed   and   wish   i   would   have   just   stuck   with   the   cups   i   knew   worked   instead   of   wasting   my   money   on   these   cups .   i   haven   t   written   a   review   for   a   product   before ,   but   am   hoping   this   will   help   another   parent   out .   i   wish   i   would   have   done   more   research   before   buying   these   cups .
it   s   ok   i   wish   this   harness   had   the   ability   to   hook   the   handle   on   the   side   for   when   my   son   is   walking   next   to   me .   also ,   forget   the   pocket   i   don   t   even   know   why   it   s   there   tiny   .   i   also   wish   you   could   take   off   the   leash   and   use   it   wrist   to   wrist .
kept   the   car   seat   clean .   i   bought   this   bag   and   the   one   for   a   double   stroller ,   but   eventhough   the   bag   for   the   stroller   ripped   as   soon   as   we   picked   up   the   bag   with   the   stroller   in   it ,   this   bag   worked   out   great   and   it   gave   me   peace   of   mind   that   the   car   seat   would   be   clean   when   we   got   it   back   at   the   gate .
my   favorites   i   ve   used   several   types   and   brands   of   diapers   and   these   are   the   ones   i   come   back   to   every   time .   they   are   simple ,   good   quality   and   you   can   t   beat   the   price .   i   reach   for   these   prefolds   and   covers   first .   the   cover   fits   trim ,   is   soft ,   pliable   and   thin   so   it   is   not   as   hot   in   warmer   weather   as   others .   when   baby   gets   older ,   you   fold   the   prefold   long   ways   and   it   is   skinnier   through   the   legs   making   walking   and   getting   around   easier   without   bulk .   they   absorb   very   well .   i   wish   i   d   bought   these   first   instead   of   spending   money   on   other ,   more   expensive   systems .   love   these !
great   for   swaddling   these   blankets   came   in   so   handy   for   swaddling   our   baby   during   the   first   month   or   so .   after   buying   this   set ,   we   received   an   aden   anais   set   made   with   bamboo .   i   highly   recommend   the   bamboo   ones .   they   are   so   much   softer !
great   teethers   these   are   very   nice   teethers .   they   are   easy   for   my   3   month   old   to   grip .   they   are   nice   and   small   and   light   which   makes   them   easy   for   young   teethers   to   handle .   the   vanilla   scent   is   nice   too .
great   nursing   cover   very   soft   i   really   like   this   nursing   cover .   haven   t   used   it   for   nursing   yet   but   i   can   t   wait .   i   ordered   the   suri   pattern   and   it   is   a   really   pretty   pale   orange   and   almost   a   teal   blue   color .   i   wish   they   had   a   sling   in   the   same   pattern   as   i   would   love   to   buy   it .   it   s   very   adjustable   and   i   think   i   m   going   to   have   plenty   of   room   to   nurse   underneath   it   without   exposing   too   much   in   public .   it   is   very   soft   cotton   fabric   and   seems   breathable .
stays   in !   this   is   the   only   pacifier   we   could   find   for   my   son   that   he   could   keep   in   his   mouth !   great   product .
looks   great ,   but   had   issues   assembling   when   we   put   this   high   chair   together   we   ran   in   to   two   issues .   we   had   about   half   of   it   already   put   together   and   were   attempting   to   add   another   piece   that   required   a   screw   to   go   in   a   hole .   well ,   we   had   the   two   pieces   perfectly   aligned   but   the   holes   did   not   match   up .   my   husband   had   to   make   another   hole   with   his   tools .   when   we   finished   that   and   had   to   put   the   little   rubber   pieces   on   the   bottom ,   it   was   missing   a   piece ,   so   we   had   to   use   the   hot   glue   gun   and   squirt   some   glue   in   to   it   so   that   the   screw   would   stay .   it   has   held   up   just   fine ,   but   like   i   said ,   we   had   to   do   a   few   things   to   make   it   work .   it   is   a   great   chair   though ! !   we   really   love   it   and   also   love   how   it   can   be   used   for   boy   or   girl .   br   br   after   all   of   our   issues   i   called   amazon   and   explained   the   situation .   they   were   wonderful   and   gave   me   a   credit   for   my   next   order .   way   to   make   a   cranky   customer   happy !  
good   but   not   great   my   son   has   been   using   this   mattress   for   about   six   months   now ,   he   is   20lbs ,   9   months   old .   it   sinks   wherever   he   is   sitting   or   laying .   it   doesn   t   seem   to   provide   him   with   any   support   which   i   didn   t   think   was   a   big   deal   for   a   baby   but   when   you   can   literally   see   it   sink   where   he   is   laying   you   have   to   wonder .   not   recommended .
works   great ,   my   child   likes   to   wear   it   too   the   skinsafers   works   well   for   my   little   boy .   his   knees   were   always   scrapped ,   scratched   and   bruised .   with   this   product   his   knees   are   protected   and   so   is   his   clothes .   i   like   the   one   size   fits   all   so   that   we   were   able   to   use   them   when   he   first   started   crawling   and   then   later   when   he   was   walking   and   running   around .   i   no   longer   have   to   fear   for   my   child   when   he   starts   running   on   pavement   or   concrete !
bath   tub   bumper   this   tub   bumper   is   very   easy   to   inflate   and   install   around   the   tub   and   keeps   my   22   month   old   granddaughter   safe   as   she   tries   to   swim   in   my   tub .   she   enjoys   her   daily   bath   and   this   bumper   allows   her   to   have   fun   without   the   worry   of   hitting   her   head .   my   only   complaint   is   that   it   does   not   stay   in   place .   it   has   large   suction   cups   but   they   are   spaced   too   far   apart   causing   the   bumper   to   come   detached   whenever   it   is   touched   or   when   the   water   level   reaches   the   bottom   of   the   bumper .   more   suction   cups   need   to   be   added .   even   though   this   can   be   problematic ,   i   would   still   recommend   this   product   as   a   safety   item   for   the   bath .
love   it   this   is   my   second   beco .   i   had   a   butterfly2   but   i   didnt   like   all   of   the   buckles .   i   love   this   one   and   so   does   my   baby .   the   pattern   is   super   cute   and   i   get   lots   of   compliments   on   it .   its   nicely   padded   everywhere .
works ,   but   tube   shrinks   the   plastic   tube   is   made   of   cheap   plastic ,   therefore ,   do   not   use   hot   water   to   wash ,   it   will   shrink   the   tubes .
adorable   product !   baby   aspen   sweet   pea   5   pc   layette   was   adorable   and   was   received   as   promised ... overnight   delivery ! i   needed   it   as   a   baby   shower   gift   the   next   day   and   the   mommy   to   be   just   loved   it .   great   presentation   in   the   gift   basket   as   well !
these   were   great ...   until   my   16   month   old   daughter   figured   out   how   to   open   them .   i   had   one   on   each   drawer   in   my   kitchen ,   and   on   my   dishwasher   door .   they   worked   well   for   about   a   month   and   a   half ,   until   i   saw   my   toddler   run   out   of   the   kitchen   holding   a   dirty   butter   knife   out   of   the   dishwasher .   i   grabbed   it ,   put   it   away ,   and   shut   and   locked   the   door   only   to   watch   her   little   fingers   open   the   lock   and   open   the   dishwasher   door   again .   back   to   the   drawing   board   for   this   mom !
great   bag   quality   yes .   good   for   both   mom   dad   yes .   holds   enough   for   newborn   infant   yes .   adjustable   strap   is   great ,   number   of   pockets   are   great .   please   note   things   put   in   pocket   and   decrease   the   amount   of   rom   on   the   inside   just   as   most   things   with   pockets   do   .
weird   pillowcase   thing   when   my   mom   was   visiting   and   helping   with   the   baby ,   she   asked   me   what   the   weird   pillowcase   thing   was .   and   that   really   is   kind   of   how   to   describe   these .   they   re   two   sheets   of   cotton   stitched   together   around   the   edges .   the   cotton   is   like   soft   t   shirt   material .   it   s   very   soft .   unfortunately   it   s   not   absorbent   so   they   ended   up   not   being   that   practical .   i   ended   up   being   much   happier   with   the   asin   b001ckyn5a   gerber   brand   6   pack   prefold   birdseye   organic   diaper ,   white  
the   easiest   tint   job   ever   note   these   are   not   big   enough   to   cover   entire   windows ,   just   a   good   amount .   13   x   20   sheets   these   aren   t   window   tinting ,   but   they   are .   this   is   a   staticly   clung   to   your   window   tint .   i   just   got   done   installing   this   and   have   found   that   i   could   play   with   it   seven   hundred   times   to   get   it   perfect ,   and   it   was   still   clinging   to   the   window .   these   come   packed   into   a   box   the   size   of   a   cig   pack .   first   thing ,   take   them   out   and   lay   them   flat   in   the   sun ,   at   night   put   a   bunch   of   weight   on   top   of   them .   i   put   these   in   the   back   windows   and   those   were   already   tinted ,   and   these   just   add   to   the   darkness .   they   are   easy   to   cut ,   easy   to   work ,   i   used   my   hand   a   lot   and   a   credit   card .   i   had   no   problems ,   just   went   from   one   side   to   the   other .   i   will   update   if   i   have   any   faults ...   but   for   now ,   its   a   great   item   to   cover   light   from   the   kids !   update   today ,   jan   2nd ,   they   are   still   in   place ,   holding   strong .   a   few   air   bubbles   showed   up ,   but   with   fingers ,   they   are   taken   out .   im   going   to   buy   another   pack ,   i   want   to   add   to   the   back   windows   of   my   suv .   good   luck
peace   of   mind   i   had   a   preemie   and   was   terrified   of   sids .   i   couldn   t   use   the   angel   care   monitor   becuase   our   daughter   was   sleeping   in   a   bassinnet   in   our   room .   this   was   the   perfect   solution .   i   slept   so   much   better   once   i   had   this .   once   she   got   bigger   and   kicked   and   rolled   more ,   it   would   pop   off   and   alarm ,   but   a   few   false   alarms   are   a   small   price   to   pay   for   peace   of   mind .   she   never   seemed   to   notice   it .   it   doesn   t   emit   or   receive   radio   signals ,   so   you   don   t   need   to   worry   about   radiation .   buy   it   worth   every   penny .
love   this !   we   got   this   for   our   son   s   first   christmas .   we   just   did   his   3   year   old   tin   today   and   came   here   to   find   a   new   set   for   our   daughter !   other   posts   are   right   it   is   a   balance   of   putting   their   hand   in   and   rinsing   and   putting   their   hand   in   and   rinsing   until   the   plaster   is   at   just   the   right   firmness   to   hold   a   print .   if   you   are   looking   for   something   perfect   this   probably   isn   t   for   you .   it   s   not   the   fault   of   the   product ,   simply   this   is   a   hard   thing   to   get   a   child   to   cooperate   with .   we   ve   always   had   fairly   good   success   and   i   don   t   mind   that   the   prints   aren   t   perfect   they   are   made   my   him   at   each   age ,   and   meant   to   reflect   his   size   and   nature   at   that   time ... clearly   our   two   year   old   one   was   a   little   messy !   i   would   recommend   starting   with   a   little   less   than   the   1   4   cup   of   water ... and   definately   don   t   bother   trying   an   impressionright   away   as   they   say   it   takes   at   least   30   seconds   to   start   firming   at   all   and   then   it   s   probably   too   firm   within   4   5   minutes ... so   you   have   a   couple   minutes   to   keep   retrying ... just   smack   the   tin   on   the   countertop   to   clear   the   previous   mold   and   start   over !
baby   sling   this   sling   is   wonderful .   it   s   padded   at   the   shoulder   which   helps   to   make   it   very   comfortable .   the   elastic   around   the   sling   pouch   is   nice   and   stretchy   so   it   s   easy   to   get   baby   in   and   out .   i   love   that   it   has   pockets   on   both   sides   so   that   i   can   tuck   the   pacifier   in   there   when   it   drops   out   of   baby   s   mouth   when   she   falls   asleep .   my   baby   always   falls   asleep   in   this !   this   type   of   sling   allows   moms   to   carry   in   many   different   positions .   i   like   that   there   isn   t   a   bunch   of   extra   fabric   hanging   down   like   with   other   ring   slings .
child   at   heart   when   i   was   toddler   i   loved   tags   and   always   played   with   whatever   tag   i   could   reach .   now   i   m   in   high   school   and   the   stress   has   rekindled   my   love   of   tags .   i   make   a   point   to   wear   a   shirt   with   a   good   tag   the   silky   kind   on   test   days   or   when   i   have   a   presentation .   this   is   a   great   product   that   i   can   use   when   i   can   t   fall   asleep   or   fiddle   with   to   help   me   focus .   the   tags   are   a   good   size   to   stick   my   fingers   in   and   the   blanket   it   soo   soft .   it   s   also   a   good   size   to   bring   to   sleepovers   or   throw   in   my   backpack .
worst   ever ....   this   is   the   worst   bathtub   ever .   we   bought   the   infant   deluxe   fist   with   jets   and   the   shower   head   did   not   work .   we   took   it   back   to   babies   r   us   and   they   told   us   that   they   were   getting   a   lot   back ..... so   we   exchanged   it   for   the   original   one   and   the   shower   head   did   not   put   out   any   water   at   all ....... if   you   are   looking   for   something   that   has   a   spray   nozzle   for   your   baby   this   is   not   the   product   you   want   to   buy ..... money   wasted ...
sage   is   a   darker   color   i   m   having   a   baby   girl   but   wanted   a   different   color   since   there   is   so   much   pink   in   her   closet   so   didn   t   want   any   more   pink .   decided   to   go   with   the   sage   and   it   looked   like   a   light   green   online   but   when   we   received   it ,   it   was   a   different   darker   green   than   what   is   shown .   besides   the   color   i   d   recommend   this   product .   i   have   quite   a   few   clothes   that   needed   sorting   and   baby   isn   t   due   for   another   8   weeks   but   once   baby   gets   here   i   didn   t   want   hubby   to   just   go   in   and   pick   anything ,   thus   the   need   for   clothes   organizers .   i   m   sure   if   it   wasn   t   for   husbands   there   really   would   be   no   need   for   these .  
durable ,   excellent   price .   recently   bought   a   second   bag .   no   worries ,   the   first   one   is   still   going   strong   our   family   has   grown   and   we   needed   another   bag   and   based   on   our   experience   with   this   car   seat   travel   bag ,   we   did   not   even   hesitate   buying   one   more .   first   of   all ,   the   material   is   much   thicker   and   stronger   than   i   originally   expected .   it   holds   up   well   and   is   easy   to   wipe   clean .   the   straps   are   nice   and   strong ,   and   my   husband   swears   they   are   comfortable   too   he   does   most   of   the   hauling .   it   sits   well   on   your   back   just   the   right   spot   on   an   average   height   person   but   even   a   petite   woman   like   me   can   t   complain   and   i   m   barely   5   feet   tall .   we   were   trying   to   choose   between   a   bag   with   straps   vs .   bag   with   wheels   and   are   really   glad   we   went   with   straps .   we   don   t   use   backpacks   when   travelling   so   it   is   very   convenient   to   throw   this   on   your   back   so   your   hands   are   free   to   pull   suitcases ,   push   a   stroller   or   carry   a   cranky   toddler !
a   light   stroller   that   works   with   an   infant   car   seat   this   stroller   is   light ,   attractive ,   sturdy ,   is   a   great   value ,   and   works   great   with   the   infant   car   seat .   we   are   still   using   it   three   years   on   with   our   second   child .   folding   is   about   as   simple   as   it   gets   and   it   pretty   much   lives   in   the   back   of   our   prius   with   decent   room   left   over   for   bags   and   groceries .   nothing   has   broken   on   it .   there   are   a   lot   of   more   expensive   strollers   and   combi   systems ,   but   i   m   not   really   sure   what   they   could   do   any   better .   this   one   hits   the   real   sweet   spot .   most   other   similar   strollers   with   an   infant   seat   system   are   either   quite   a   bit   heavier ,   or   much   more   expensive   or   both .   there   are   lighter   strollers   but   do   they   work   with   an   infant   carrier   type   car   seat   what   we   really   wanted   was   a   combi   system   stroller   car   seat   that   was   light   enough   for   my   wife   to   lift   and   put   in   the   trunk .   most   of   the   combi   strollers   we   looked   at   were   more   like   25   30   pounds .   this   is   only   17   lbs .   believe   me ,   it   makes   a   difference   when   you   lug   these   things   around   4   5   times   a   day   for   a   few   years .   this   works   perfectly   with   the   matching   snugride   infant   seat .   that   comes   with   a   detachable   base ,   you   can   easily   get   extra   bases   for   different   cars .   and   everything   is   priced   very   reasonably .   i   don   t   know   if   this   is   still   the   best   on   the   market   at   this   point ,   but   it   s   been   great   for   us .   i   guess   my   advice   would   be   look   at   the   stroller   weight   before   you   buy   anything ,   and   try   to   get   something   less   than   20   lbs .
great   stroller !   i   have   the   chicco   cortina   travel   system   and   that   stoller   is   very   hard   to   maneuver   it   is   big   and   also   not   easy   to   control .   this   contours   lite   stroller   is   awesome   lightweight   and   so   easy   to   control .   i   can   push   it   one   handed   and   easily   turn   it ,   which   is   great   when   going   in   or   out   of   a   heavy   swinging   door   like   at   the   doctor   s   office   .   great   storage   underneath .   pretty   easy   to   adjust   up   and   recline   down ,   although   harder   to   push   up   with   a   baby   in   it .   i   have   4   main   complaints   the   strap   between   the   baby   s   legs   is   a   simple   narrow   strap   so   it   kind   of   digs   into   him .   he   is   cushioned   by   a   diaper ,   but   he   is   definitely   applying   pressure   to   the   strap   because   the   back   always   forces   the   baby   to   be   semi   reclined   only   a   single   cup   holder   for   the   parent   no   place   to   put   keys ,   phone ,   etc .   i   bought   a   separate   caddy   asin   b000smwups   sunshine   kids   stroller   accessory   buggy   buddy   that   velcros   onto   the   handlebar   and   that   works   well ,   but   that   was   an   extra   15   or   so .   the   canopy   sort   of   snaps   open   because   it   resists   opening   and   then   all   of   a   sudden   opens .   same   with   closing ,   but   slightly   less   dramatic   snap .   when   my   baby   is   sleeping ,   i   hate   to   be   opening   or   closing   the   canopy   since   it   s   so   loud .   but   my   baby   generally   sleeps   though   it   so   it   s   not   much   of   a   problem .   the   shoulder   straps   are   difficult   to   adjust ,   or   at   least   i   haven   t   figured   out   how   to   do   it .   if   you   can   t   just   grab   something   and   intuitively   figure   out   how   to   adjust   it ,   it   s   not   a   good   design .   the   price   is   great   54   or   so   and   it   is   light   and   easy   to   maneuver ,   so   it   generally   suits   my   purposes .   i   may   add   padding   to   the   crotch   strap   as   my   baby   gets   older .
neat   the   stars   look   great   on   the   ceiling   and   they   form   constellations .   it   comes   with   a   guide   to   the   constellations   as   well   as   a   story   book   .   this   is   an   awesome   little   nightlight .
great   idea ,   poor   execution   have   had   this   sound   machine   since   my   son   was   born   2.5   years   ago .   about   a   year   ago   it   started   acting   wiggy ...   it   wouldn   t   turn   off   with   the   button   have   to   unplug   the   power   source   from   the   back   to   turn   it   off   and   sometimes   the   other   buttons   don   t   work   either .   i   love   that   it   has   a   built   in   nightlight ,   but   that   has   also   been   acting   strangely   it   doesn   t   always   turn   off   again ,   i   have   to   unplug   the   power   cord   from   the   back   to   shut   it   off   .   br   br   as   far   as   music   selection   goes ,   it   s   good   but   not   great .   it   doesn   t   have   that   many   songs   on   each   set   so   it   loops   over   and   over   which ,   i   would   personally   find   annoying   so   i   don   t   put   my   son   through   it   .   and   there   s   no   way   that   i   found   to   go   back   or   forward   with   the   songs .   my   son   likes   one   particular   song   and   doesn   t   understand   when   i   tell   him   we   have   to   wait   for   it   ...   or   that   we   can   t   hear   it   again   right   away .   br   br   the   nature   sounds   are   not   that   great   i   was   hoping   for   a   nice ,   calming   ocean   sound   but   there   doesn   t   seem   to   be   one   on   here .   the   only   one   that   i   heard   was   the   one   with   the   whales   which   sounds   too   scary   for   a   baby   s   room ,   especially   when   they   are   alone   in   the   dark   .   i   usually   just   leave   it   on   the   white   noise   sound .   br   br   the   sound   speakers   are   just   okay   kind   of   has   that   hollow   sound   to   it   so   i   really   haven   t   bothered   using   the   ipod   with   it .   br   br   i   think   the   idea   is   good ,   but   the   quality   is   not .   was   tetering   on   whether   to   give   it   one   stars   or   two   and   decided   one   based   on   quality   and   sound .   do   yourself   a   favor   and   get   a   regular   sound   machine ,   homedics   makes   a   decent   one   that   you   can   dock   play   an   ipod   with .
perfect   for   a   newborn   this   is   a   great   pacifier   for   a   newborn .   this   was   the   pacifier   that   they   were   using   in   the   neonatal   intensive   care   unit   at   the   hospital   and   our   baby   loves   it .
like   it   but ..   i   originally   got   the   brown   bear   wubbanub   for   my   daughter .   i   loved   it   so   much   and   ordered   a   second   one   for   her .   it   does   its   job   have   her   paci   stay   in   place   in   a   cute   way .   but   i   take   one   star   off   because   the   long   horn   is   less   soft   than   the   brown   bear .   it   feels   a   bit   rough   and   that   was   a   bit   disappointing   to   me .
best   pacifiers   i   have   found .   my   10   week   old   is   not   one   for   pacifiers   which   is   killing   me .   she   also   isn   t   a   thumb   sucker .   so   there   are   times   where   she   is   just   completely   inconsolable   unless   we   give   her   a   little   peppermint   water   in   a   bottle ,   she   takes   a   sip   and   its   over .   i   found   these   at   my   local   kroger   last   night ,   and   they   were   completely   different   from   all   the   other   pacifiers   i   had   tried .   i   brought   them   home ,   popped   one   in   her   mouth ,   she   didn   t   spit   it   out   and   was   in   dreamland   in   under   3   minutes .   the   gummi   ones   didn   t   work ,   the   orthodontic   ones   did   not   work ,   pretty   much   everything .   i   have   gone   thru   over   20   pacifiers   trying   to   find   ones   she   likes .   and   we   have   found   them .   thank   you   playtex .   you   saved   my   sanity .
sometimes   works   first ,   the   soothie   pacifier   which   is   attached   to   the   bear   is   not   as   well   designed   as   the   gumdrop   pacifier .   the   soothie   has   a   circular   disc   which   smooshes   my   baby   s   nose   as   he   sucks   on   the   pacifier ,   whereas   the   gumdrop   is   designed   around   the   nose .   second ,   the   soothie   is   at   an   awkward   angle   because   one   end   is   sewn   to   the   bear   s   mouth .   this   would   be   only   good   to   enable   the   baby   to   push   the   pacifier   out   if   he   didn   t   want   it   anymore .   but   my   newborn   doesn   t   have   the   ability   to   keep   the   pacifier   in   his   mouth ,   which   is   the   whole   reason   why   i   bought   this   product .   i   found   it   actually   works   better   to   place   the   bear   upside   down   then   insert   the   pacifier   into   my   baby   s   mouth .   third ,   the   bear   is   very   light .   i   wish   it   were   weighted   down   with   a   bean   bag   of   some   sort .   my   son   is   big   and   strong   15   lbs   at   2   months   and   twists   and   wriggles   in   his   crib   so   the   bear   doesn   t   stay   on   his   chest .   we   no   longer   swaddle   him .   the   only   time   the   wubbanub   works   is   if   he   s   wearing   a   zippered   sleep   sac   or   hoodie   so   we   tuck   the   bear   into   his   hoodie   sleep   sac   so   it   actually   stays   in   place .
cute   seems   good ,   looks   cute ,   waiting   for   the   baby   to   arrive   to   try   it   out .   love   the   skull   on   it .   its   gerber   goth
picture   is   misleading   so ,   i   take   responsibility   for   not   reading   the   description   well   enough   to   realize   that   there   are   actually   only   2   pacifiers   but   the   picture   gave   the   impression   that   there   would   be   4   pacifiers .   i   am   pretty   disappointed .   the   2   stars   is   based   solely   on   the   item   picture   within   amazon .   we   love   these   pacifiers   and   would   give   them   5   stars .
only   lasted   20   months   the   video   quality   was   not   great ,   but   it   was   fine   for   the   price .   the   monitor   works   fine ,   but   the   camera   night   vision   quit   after   20   months .   it   works   when   the   room   is   light ,   but   that   is   obviously   not   when   we   usually   want   to   use   it .   we   are   just   disappointed   it   didn   t   last   longer .
cute !   i   think   i   love   this   toy   more   than   my   baby !   bought   it   for   him   when   he   was   6   months   old .   has   had   it   for   a   month   now .   he   s   not   too   into   it   for   long   but   does   play   with   it .   he   s   more   into   the   hands   than   the   teethers .   one   thing   that   keeps   me   from   giving   it   a   full   5   stars   is   that   the   green   fabric ,   towel   like ,   is   starting   to   lint .   i   only   hand   washed   it   so   far   but   it   says   it   can   me   machined   washed .
does   the   job   i   like   these   because   i   can   leave   it   on   the   buckle   without   having   to   remove   it   each   time   i   take   my   son   out   of   his   booster   seat .   my   son   can   t   reach   down   far   enough   or   perhaps   isn   t   strong   enough   with   one   finger   to   release   the   belt ,   but   i   can .   my   husband   with   his   larger   fingers   just   uses   the   car   key .   getting   the   knob   to   come   off   every   time   would   be   a   major   hassle   it   is   difficult ,   but   it   s   not   an   issue   if   you   leave   it   in   place .   a   word   to   the   wise   on   installation   close   it   and   slide   it   down   over   the   top   of   the   buckle   rather   than   opening   it   and   trying   to   wrap   it   around .   i   thought   it   wasn   t   going   to   fit   at   first .
danger ! ! !   almost   broke   my   baby   s   fingers ! ! ! !   we   got   the   chair   about   a   year   ago . on   nov .   23rd   a   day   before   thanks   giving   i   was   going   to   feed   my   18   months   old   girl .   i   reclined   the   chair   back   and   set   her   on   it   and   pulled   the   chair   forward   as   i   always   do .   i   then   heard   her   scream   like   she   never   scream   before !   her   fingers   were   stuck   between   the   chair   and   the   arm   rest ! ! !   i   reclined   the   chair   and   pulled   her   out   of   it   her   fingers   were   blue   and   she   wouldn   t   move   them   and   wouldn   t   stop   crying !   i   got   her   into   the   car   to   go   to   the   hospital   thinking   i   may   have   broken   her   fingers , half   way   to   the   hospital   she   stopped   crying ,   i   stopped   the   car   and   checked   her   fingers ,   they   were   red   and   she   did   move   them .   i   went   back   home   and   wrapped   her   hand   with   ice   on   and   off   for   a   few   hours .   finally   the   next   day   she   was   moving   her   fingers   and   the   swelling   went   down .   i   reported   the   incident   and   i   ma   waiting   to   hear   back   from   them .   i   would   not   recommend   this   chair !   it   has   been   packed   and   put   in   my   garage   until   i   can   return   it   to   manufacture .
fun   bath   toys   we   received   this   as   a   gift   at   my   baby   shower   and   i   was   eager   to   use   them .   we   first   brought   them   out   when   my   daughter   was   about   5   months   old   and   she   loves   them !   we   still   use   them   during   bathtime   she   is   almost   11   months   and   also   have   a   few   out   on   her   play   area   since   she   likes   chewing   on   them .   she   giggles   when   i   squirt   her   with   them   and   likes   the   bright   colors .   good   product   for   a   reasonable   price   highly   recommended .
couldnt   be   without   it   i   am   25   weeks   pregnant   and   i   love   this   product .   great   pillow .   very   comfy ,   i   couldn   t   do   without   it .   would   definitely   recommend .
transitioning   tool   we   used   this   night   light   in   our   room   when   our   infant   was   still   sleeping   in   there   near   us   at   night .   she   got   used   to   seeing   the   lights   as   she   went   to   sleep ,   so   when   we   transitioned   her   to   her   crib   in   the   nursery   a   few   months   after   she   was   born ,   the   lights   were   familiar .   we   also   took   the   turtle   with   us   when   we   traveled ,   so   she   would   have   something   familiar   there   too .   worked   great !   we   love   the   soft   light ,   and   assume   it   will   be   something   our   daughter   keeps   for   much   longer   than   the   rest   of   her   baby   toys .
great   the   level   two   nipples   for   dr .   brown   s   wide   neck   bottles   are   just   another   step   in   progressing   my   child   s   development .   i   am   quite   satisfied   with   the   product ,   and   i   know   others   will   be   too .
works   well   during   clb   foot   treatment   my   son   has   bilateral   club   feet   and   i   was   worried   about   not   being   able   to   wear   him .   a   sling   worked   when   he   was   very   small   and   in   the   casts   but   by   the   time   he   was   2   months   old   he   no   longer   fit .   he   is   now   in   the   boots   and   bar   and   this   is   the   only   carrier   i   found   that   works   well ,   a   bjorn   would   have   but   would   not   be   comfortable   .   the   beco   gemini   can   be   cinched   in   at   the   crotch   suing   snaps .   this   gives   enough   space   to   make   him   comfortable   but   not   so   much   that   the   bar   would   no   long   work .   i   just   unsnap   the   bar ,   put   him   in   and   snap   the   bar   back   on .   in   a   few   months   when   he   is   free   during   the   day   i   can   use   the   carrier   as   one   normally   would .
don   t   buy   first   of   all   they   didn   t   send   the   thermometer   that   was   shown ,   and   not   one   of   the   three   i   ordered   worked .   i   then   ordered   new   batteries   and   replaced   them   and   they   still   didn   t   work .
lightweight   and   fits   through   doors   the   stroller   is   lightweight   and   easy   to   carry   on   and   off   the   bus   with   multiple   children .   i   have   never   encountered   a   door   it   would   not   fit   through .   one   of   the   wheels   did   pop   off   while   i   was   far   from   home   but   kolcraft   eventually   decided   to   replace   it   for   me .
excellent ! ! !   excellent   product   from   avent .   worth   the   money .   it   works   perfectly   for   avent   feeding   bottles .   fits   most   of   the   microwaves .   its   easy   to   use   and   would   recommend   this   product .
a   real   life   saver   or   sleep   saver   when   our   little   one   was   born ,   we   set   up   a   pack   n   play   in   our   room   for   her   to   sleep   in .   unfortunately ,   she   was   a   picky   sleeper   and   would   scream   nearly   the   instant   we   would   put   her   down .   we   would   then   walk   over ,   put   a   hand   on   her   for   a   few   minutes   before   she   would   fall   back   asleep .   and   then   she   would   do   that   over   and   over   again   all   night .   this   co   sleeper   really   saved   the   day .   it   was   a   bit   of   a   pain   to   put   together .   we   have   a   queen   size   bed   and   the   adjustment   mechanism   is   in   between   the   mattress   and   the   box   spring ,   so   we   had   to   adjust   the   straps ,   lower   the   mattress ,   lift   the   mattress   and   readjust   the   straps ,   over   and   over   again   until   it   was   perfect .   a   slight   redesign   to   put   the   adjustment   mechanism   at   either   end   would   make   set   up   much   easier .   however ,   once   it   was   set   up ,   it   was   fantastic .   when   she   would   fuss ,   i   could   just   put   my   hand   on   her .   when   she   lost   her   pacifier ,   i   could   quickly   reinsert   it .   when   it   was   time   to   breast   feed ,   i   could   just   pick   her   up .   when   she   was   done ,   i   could   gently   put   her   down .   the   co   sleeper   made   life   much   better   by   allowing   us   to   actually   sleep   without   getting   out   of   bed   all   night   to   check   on   our   little   one .   we   only   really   used   the   co   sleeper   for   2   months   until   she   was   ready   for   her   pack   n   play ,   but   our   sanity   and   sleep   was   completely   worth   the   price   of   the   co   sleeper .
nice   and   baby   loves   it   this   item   is   very   well   designed   to   catch   the   attention   of   babies .   our   baby   loves   this   mobile   gym   and   likes   the   music   and   light   that   plays   with   it .   felt   little   pricey   for   the   product   but   by   looking   at   the   prices   on   shops   i   felt   amazon   is   the   way   to   go .   i   can   leave   the   baby   in   the   mobile   gym   for   a   while   and   get   my   work   done .   the   gym   can   provide   tummy   time   and   activity   for   legs   and   hands .   our   baby   laughs   and   makes   sounds   by   looking   at   the   butterflies   on   top   while   the   lights   come   and   go .
its   cute   but   we   never   use   it !   its   a   very   cute   mobile   that   goes   great   with   the   all   star   sports   theme ,   but   we   never   use   it   and   it   just   gets   in   my   way   when   i   need   to   strip   the   bed   and   when   i   put   clean   sheets   on   the   bed .   i   am   sure   some   people   use   their   mobile   all   the   time   but   for   me   it   was   another   thing   i   thought   i   needed   to   buy   for   my   1st   baby ... truth   be   told ... it   was   a   waist   of   money .
great   this   is   shorter   then   what   they   say , i   read   the   other   people   reviews   when   buying   so   it   was   great   for   my   45   year   old   bassinet .   my   daughter   has   been   sleeping   on   it   roughly   3   weeks   now   and   its   doing   fine   it   wipes   clean   very   easy   and   sheets   fit   it   well   given   that   it   is   a   little   to   short ,   i   would   so   buy   it   again   if   i   needed   to .
the   best   pacifier   out   there !   these   are   the   best   pacifiers   out   there   and   worth   the   they   don   t   fall   apart ,   easy   for   my   baby   to   find   and   pick   up   can   be   doubled   as   a   toy   great   for   car   rides   and   they   look   adorable   to   boot !
great   product   excellent   product !   we   love .   we   recently   lost   dino   one   and   we   found   this   to   replace   it   but   rather ,   it   was   better   idea   since   the   head   part   was   not   that   heavy   so   it   stayed   with   him   better .
baby   s   favorite   this   is   the   style   they   give   babies   at   the   hospital .   it   fits   small   babies .   the   other   ones   almost   cover   their   faces .   most   of   us   are   worried   that   they   will   get   hooked   on   the   pacifier .   when   they   are   just   born ,   they   will   either   go   for   the   pacfier ,   or   their   thumb .   i   prefer   the   pacifier   which   i   can   remove   once   i   want   it .
a   must   have   for   any   new   baby ! ! ! ! !   unlike   most   pacifiers   on   the   market ,   that   are   listed   as   0   3   months ... these   are   actually   made   for   newborns .   they   are   better   than   any   of   the   other   pacis   that   are   more   expensive . the   nipple   on   these   are   smaller   and   easier   for   them   to   attach   to .   the   pacifier   is   hollow   in   the   middle   so   they   can   actually   suck   the   pacifier   and   keep   it   in   their   mouth   without   you   holding   it   the   whole   time .   the   work   great   in   steamer   or   the   dishwasher   to   sanitize .   this   is   truly   a   must   purchase ,   regardless   of   you   like   pacifiers   or   not ... a   great   back   up   plan !
this   sucks !   i   didnt   even   want   to   give   this   a   one   star !   this   medicine   pacifier   does   not   work !   the   hole   is   to   big ,   medicine   just   comes   pouring   out ,   and   the   pacifer   part   is   hard   plastic !   my   child   choked   on   the   medicine .   do   not   buy   this   product ! ! ! ! ! ! !
product   as   described   good   product   that   was   described   accurately .   this   was   a   present   to   my   husband   the   bears   fan   of   the   house .   fun   to   see   in   baby   girl   s   mouth ! !
not   as   good   as   mam   my   little   one   prefers   the   mam   pacifiers ,   which   have   a   grip   surface   on   the   nipple   so   the   baby   can   keep   it   in   his   mouth   easier .   what   i   did   like   about   these   avent   pacifiers   are   the   caps   that   go   over   the   nipple   for   protection .   i   like   that   i   can   toss   it   in   my   diaper   bag   or   purse   and   not   worry   about   the   nipple   getting   dirty .
will   save   for   later ...   our   baby   is   currently   5   weeks   old   and   i   think   he   s   a   little   young   for   the   binkibear .   he   doesn   t   have   good   movement   yet   and   ends   up   either   yanking   the   bear   and   the   pacifier   out   of   his   mouth ,   or   it   causes   the   pacifier   to   sit   crooked   in   his   mouth .   its   a   fabulous   product   that   we   will   have   to   put   away   until   he   s   old   enough .
happy   babies   love   this   bear ..   they   make   great   baby   shower   gifts .. a   very   nice   first   teddy   bear   will   last   for   years   to   come
nipple   is   soft   like   soothie   pacifier   i   cannot   stand   the   soothie   pacifier   because   they   hide   my   daughters   gorgeous   face .   i   have   tried   so   many   others   and   this   is   the   only   one   that   my   daughter   will   take   besides   the   gumdrop   and   soothie .   i   think   it   is   because   the   nipple   is   soft   like   the   soothie .   cute   colors   and   great   price .   so   happyl   i   tried   these   pacifiers
nuk   pacifier   holder   i   love   this   thing !   it   keeps   my   son   s   paci   clean   while   it   is   sitting   in   my   diaper   bag   i   would   recommend   this   to   any   mommy   who   has   a   paci   baby !
fantastic   pacifier   my   first   baby   was   a   nicu   child   290   days   so   by   the   time   he   came   home   he   was   hooked   on   the   gumdrop   pacifier   offered   to   him   in   nicu ,   which   we   then   had   to   have   imported   as   they   re   not   available   over   the   counter   in   australia .   our   son   loved   this   pacifier   and   it   suited   all   our   purposes .   it   was   easy   to   clean ,   hard   wearing ,   and   was   awesome   during   teething   as   i   d   just   put   it   in   the   freezer ,   making   it   nice   and   cold   in   his   mouth   during   the   many   bouts   of   teething .   our   next   child   was   born   4   months   ago   and   i   ordered   the   gumdrop   pacifier   for   her .   she   has   a   range   of   pacifiers   in   her   crib ,   but   ultimately   her   all   time   favourite   is   the   gumdrop   pacifier .   love   this   product   and   highly   recommend   it   to   all !
good   product ,   does   its   job   it   s   a   good   product   and   easily   fits   two   soothie   pacifiers .   only   issue   is   that   it   closes   loudly   bad   for   quiet   places   like   church   and   the   hook   is   a   little   large   and   doesn   t   stay   hooked   onto   the   diaper   bag .
backfired   i   only   bought   this   pacifier   because   it   was   supposed   to   glow   in   the   dark   and   i   thought   it   would   make   it   easier   to   find   it   when   my   daughter   dropped   it   in   the   middle   of   the   night .   it   does   glow   a   little ,   but   not   for   long .   after   a   few   minutes   in   the   dark   the   glow   disappears   and   in   the   middle   of   the   night   when   you   most   need   it   it   is   long   time   gone .   br   it   also   has   a   different   shape   than   the   regular   avent .   it   is   not   symmetrical   and   has   an   up   and   down   side .   so ,   in   addition   to   be   as   hard   to   find   as   a   regular   pacifier ,   i   still   have   to   figure   out   in   the   dark   which   side   is   up   and   down .   conclusion   not   really   good   for   nighttime .   br   in   a   side   note ,   avents   are   good   quality   pacifiers   and   this   one   is   not   different .   better   as   a   day   pacifier   though .
needs   to   be   larger   sturdier   we   used   this   to   carry   my   son   s   nuk   pacifiers .   it   will   only   fit   one   6   month   pacifier   comfortably .   you   can   sort   of   fit   a   second   one   if   you   really   jam   it   in   there   just   right   and   don   t   mind   the   rubber   part   getting   bent   back .   the   main   problem   with   this   is   the   closure   it   pops   open   very ,   very   easily .   so   if   you   use   the   hook   to   hang   it   on   the   outside   of   your   diaper   bag ,   and   you   bump   the   bag   on   something ,   you   may   find   the   container   has   opened   and   the   pacifier   has   fallen   out .   however ,   the   hook   does   stay   put   on   the   loop   of   our   diaper   bag   pretty   well .   just   wish   it   would   stay   closed .   without   a   secure   closure ,   the   hook   is   pretty   useless .
love   it   i   absoluteness   love   this   item   wubbanubs   are   the   best .   i   got   my   daughter   hers   back   in   07   and   she   used   it   everyday .   this   purchase   is   for   a   friend   and   i   can   not   wait   to   give   it   to   her .   the   shipping   was   fast   also ! ! !
son   wouldn   t   take   it   it   s   a   fine   pacifier   if   your   kid   will   take   it ,   my   son   didn   t .   i   also   bought   the   much   cheaper   gerber   classic   pacifier   and   compared   the   two   and   there   is   no   difference   in   the   nipple   bulb .   natural   rubber ,   but   still   overpriced .
why   doesn   t   everyone   else   make   pacifiers   with   caps   we   have   gone   through   many   different   pacifiers   given   to   us   from   the   hospital ,   as   gifts ,   and   ones   we   bought   and   all   i   can   say   is   that   if   your   baby   will   take   this   one   it   is   the   best   if   for   no   other   reason   than   it   has   a   snap   on   cap   to   keep   it   clean .   br   br   before   this   i   had   to   carry   a   separate   little   box   to   carry   the   pacifiers .   when   it   is   needed ,   i   have   to   dig   through   the   bag   to   find   the   box ,   open   the   box ,   and   then   take   it   out .   all   the   more   difficult   if   you   are   carrying   the   baby   in   the   car   seat   at   the   time .   with   this   one ,   the   protective   cover   snaps   on   securely   enough   so   that   i   can   keep   the   pacifier   in   my   pocket   but   is   easy   enough   to   pop   off   with   one   hand .   br   br   as   i   said   before ,   if   you   are   going   to   give   your   child   a   pacifier ,   try   this   one   first ,   if   they   take   it   it   will   make   your   life   easier
serves   its   purpose   i   did   think   this   would   be   bigger   than   it   is .   i   am   using   it   for   cloth   diapers   and   can   fit   about   4   or   5   in   there .   about   the   same   as   one   i   recieved   from   the   cotton   babies   store   and   it   is   more   expensive   and   just   plain   white .   so   this   wet   bag   is   much   more   attractive   to   carry   and   cheaper   and   it   is   serving   its   purpose .   contain   the   stinky   wet   diapers !

our   favorite   binky   our   daughter   came   home   from   the   hospital   with   2   binkies ,   and   they   made   life   great ,   till   she   stopped   taking   one   for   about   a   month   and   a   half .   we   tried   them   again   in   frustration ,   but   as   she   was   closer   to   the   6   month   range ,   we   tried   a   mam   style   i   had ,   and   she   loves   them ,   and   doesn   t   sleep   without   it !   shes   is   a   much   calmer   baby   with   binkies !
only   pacifiers   my   baby   will   use ,   perfect   for   newborns !   love   these !   br   br   a   lot   of   people   say   they   re   baby   won   t   take   them   if   they   introduce   them   later ,   which   i   can   understand   because   the   nipple   is   a   lot   different   than   a   traditional   pacifier .   i   did   my   research   on   them   before   my   baby   was   born   and   decided   on   the   gumdrop ,   because   they   don   t   block   the   baby   s   face   and   the   nipple   is   more   contoured   to   a   smaller   baby   s   mouth .   i   took   them   to   the   hospital   with   me   and   my   daughter   s   been   loving   them   since   the   day   she   was   born !   i   do   think   they   are   pretty   ugly   i   like   the   other   types   with   t   he   cute   designs   ,   but   i   believe   these   are   safer   and   healthier .   my   only   concern   is   that   she   doesn   t   like   other   pacifiers   and   i   believe   these   only   go   up   to   6   months ,   i   haven   t   seen   a   larger   size   anywhere .   guess   that   s   when   we   will   try   to   take   her   off   the   bink   br   all   in   all ,   very   pleased   with   these .   br   br   ps   don   t   use   in   the   microwave   sterilizer ,   it   changes   the   pink   and   purple   to   an   ugly   brown   color ,   not   sure   why .   stick   with   hot   soap   and   water   to   clean .
trash   i   purchased   the   safety   1st   comfort   check   thermometer   with   the   bonus   pacifier   medicine   dispenser   because   my   6   month   old   daughter   has   some   medication   she   needs   to   take ,   and   at   first   glance   it   seemed   like   it   was   going   to   work   great .   i   was   wrong .   this   product   is   not   safe   at   all ! !   there   is   no   valve   to   help   slow   the   flow   of   medicine   that   comes   out .   i   may   as   well   have   just   poured   the   medicine   down   her   throat !   she   choked   on   the   medicine   because   it   just   came   pouring   out   of   the   nipple !   how   this   product   was   tested   and   approved   amazes   me .   this   is   a   trash   product   and   needs   to   be   taken   off   the   market .
great   pacifier   my   son   doesn   t   always   love   the   pacifier   but   when   he   get   wound   up   this   calms   him   down   when   he   feels   the   need   to   suck .

good   quality   the   pink   ones   were   a   wee   bit   smaller   than   the   blue   ones .   i   ordered   5   of   each   for   my   twins   and   i   noticed   the   difference   in   size .   not   sure   why   as   they   are   both   full   term .   br   br   other   than   that   the   paci   is   very   good .   the   quality   is   nice   and   so   is   the   price .
great   product   great   product .   i   ordered   it   in   pink   and   blue   for   my   twins .   for   some   weird   reason   the   pink   was   a   little   smaller   than   the   blue .   other   than   that   the   product   is   good .
works   great   my   wife   and   i   are   getting   on   in   years   and   self   balance   isn   t   what   it   used   to   be .   i   have   two   of   these   handles   mounted   on   the   shower   wall .   they   grip   great   and   helps   one   to   steady   themselves   while   showering .   i   would   recommend   them   for   young   and   old   alike   for   safety   sake .
the   perfect   potty ! !   this   is   an   absolute   potty   training   must   have !   our   toddler   has   just   begun   the   potty   training   process   and   had   been   doing   well   at   home .   the   only   problem   we   had   was   when   we   were   out   an   about .   this   solved   the   problem !   now   we   have   to   make   sure   it   stays   in   the   vehicle !   the   product   is   nicely   constructed   and   the   handle   allows   our   toddler   to   carry   it   to   the   vehicle .
great   product   great   product .   my   16   month   old   discovered   how   to   push   buttons   on   my   cable   box ,   and   this   has   stopped   him   from   doing   that !   very   happy .   delivery   was   excellent   too   arrived   much   faster   than   expected .
sagged   after   one   month   of   use   with   a   newborn   sagged   after   one   month   of   use   with   a   newborn .   after   one   month   of   use   there   is   a   permanent   dent   where   the   baby   sleeps .   frequent   rotation   of   the   mattress   really   doesn   t   improve   the   issue .   a   mattress   for   80   bucks   should   be   able   to   properly   support   an   8   lb   baby .   we   are   using   this   mattress   with   this   crib   ...   the   crib   is   great .
great   for   peace   of   mind   we   love   using   our   aquatopia   delux   safety   bath   thermometer   alarm .   it   s   set   up   so   it   only   turns   on   when   it   hits   water ,   so   it   doesn   t   overdrain   the   batteries ,   and   it   lets   you   know   if   the   water   has   gotten   too   cold   or   too   hot .   the   recommended   range   is   90   100   degrees   f ,   and   i   never   realised   before   that   what   i   would   probably   shower   in   is   actually   higher   than   100 ,   so   it   s   good   to   have   the   alarm   for   peace   of   mind .   i   would   definitely   recommend   this .   it   s   cute   and   has   worked   very   well   for   us .
an   energy   saver   fewer   reaches   for   the   dust   pan   to   clean   up   spills   my   daughter   loves   this   thing .   she   carries   it   around   by   the   handle   and   enjoys   her   snacks   all   over   the   place   in   the   car ,   in   the   stroller ,   in   the   grocery   store ,   etc .   the   only   snacks   i   have   to   pick   up   are   the   ones   she   drops   from   her   hand ,   not   the   ones   she   dumps   out   of   the   cup   because   those   don   t   exist   yay !
cute   dresser   with   beautiful   cherry   finish   this   dresser   is   a   great   buy   for   the   price .   we   are   very   pleased   by   its   beautiful ,   rich   cherry   finish .   we   had   some   reservations   about   its   durability   after   readings   its   reviews ,   but   decided   to   give   it   a   shot   because   it   matches   the   crib   we   bought .   no   regrets .   be   aware   that   the   back   of   the   dresser   and   the   bottom   of   the   drawers   are   comprised   of   particle   board .   our   dresser   arrived   with   two   broken   drawers ,   but   delta   rapidly   shipped   us   replacement   parts .   delta   s   customer   service   was   very   helpful .   we   wanted   to   fancy   up   this   dresser   a   bit ,   so   i   replaced   the   wooden   knobs   with   some   turquoise   ones .   very   easy   to   do !   all   in   all ,   we   re   pleased   with   this   purchase .
good   system ,   but   a   critical   engineering   flaw   the   first   of   these   i   purchased ,   i   had   to   return   because   the   camera   snapshot   feature   and   vox   didn   t   work .   the   second   one   i   received   worked   well   for   three   months .   my   wife   and   i   really   enjoyed   this   product .   the   video   is   of   great   quality ,   and   i   love   the   vox   feature .   we   can   monitor   both   of   our   children   while   they   are   sleeping ,   and   when   there   is   a   noise   in   the   room ,   the   camera   immediately   comes   to   life   so   we   can   survey   the   area   and   address   the   situation .   what   happened   after   three   months   my   wife   plugged   in   the   monitor   to   the   base   to   recharge ,   and   the   usb   connection   within   the   monitor   broke .   as   i   am   an   engineer ,   i   examined   the   unit   and   found   that   the   usb   connection   is   a   very   weak   point ,   and   that   you   have   to   place   the   monitor   just   so   into   its   base   to   recharge .   figuring   that   it   was   our   fault ,   i   purchased   another   one   for   our   use .   again ,   after   three   months ,   i   plugged   it   in ,   and   i   am   one   to   be   very   gentile   with   electronic   equipment ,   as   i   consider   myself   not   only   an   electronic   engineer ,   but   a   techno   geek   ,   and   it   broke   on   me .   same   thing   the   internal   usb   connection   within   the   monitor .   i   have   a   call   now   into   the   company   to   have   that   unit   replaced .   i   have   since   rigged   the   previously   broken   unit   with   my   own   recharger   and   am   temporarily   using   that   until   i   hear   back   from   the   company .   br   br   what   i   like   about   this   unit   the   cameras   are   exceptional   for   their   design .   they   are   portable ,   battery   powered   for   short   excursions   from   their   base   site   visiting   overnight   at   grandma   s   ,   or   when   we   re   at   the   beach   house ,   we   can   monitor   outside   while   the   cameras   are   sitting   where   ever   we   decide   to   mount   them .   the   batteries   in   the   cameras   and   monitors   are   okay .   they   last   us   about   four   to   five   hours .   the   cameras   are   great   at   adjusting   for   different   lighting   situations ,   from   daylight ,   to   total   darkness .   i   totally   love   the   fact   i   can   talk   back   to   the   kids   if   they   happen   to   get   up   for   something .   sometimes   a   quick   it   s   not   time   to   get   up   in   my   daddy   voice   is   all   it   takes   for   the   wee   ones   to   drop   back   down   and   go   to   sleep   for   another   hour ,   when   they   get   up   unusually   early .   i   love   the   fact   the   monitor   can   monitor   up   to   four   cameras   at   once .   since   the   kids   are   now   moving   all   over   the   place ,   i   can   have   extra   cameras   around   and   monitor   up   to   four   at   a   time   on   one   screen   ,   and   easily   select   which   camera   i   wish   to   monitor   full   screen .   br   br   what   i   don   t   like ,   is   what   i   ve   already   explained .   i   feel   that   if   the   company   can   devise   a   more   robust   usb   base   within   the   monitor   itself ,   then   this   would   be   a   perfect   product .   until   then ,   i   m   left   with   a   jerry   rigged   unit   until   they   respond   about   my   second   broken   unit .   br   br   i   did   a   lot   of   research   before   purchasing   this   unit   and   i   still   think   it   s   a   great   concept ,   just   a   weak   point   in   engineering . ck   down   and   go   to   sleep   for   another   hour ,   when   they   get   up   unusually   early .   i   love   the   fact   the   monitor   can   monitor   up   to   four   cameras   at   once .   since   the   kids   are   now   moving   all   over   the   place ,   i   can   have   extra   cameras   around   and   monitor   up   to   four   at   a   time   on   one   screen   ,   and   easily   select   which   camera   i   wish   to   monitor   full   screen .   what   i   don   t   like ,   is   what   i   ve   already   explained .   i   feel   that   if   the   company   can   devise   a   more   robust   usb   base   within   the   monitor   itself ,   then   this   would   be   a   perfect   product .   until   then ,   i   m   left   with   a   jerry   rigged   unit   until   they   respond   about   my   second   broken   unit .   i   did   a   lot   of   research   before   purchasing   this   unit   and   i   still   think   it   s   a   great   concept ,   just   a   weak   point   in   engineering .
passionateforsafety   my   husband   wanted   to   put   our   kids   in   a   booster   since   they   have   outgrown   their   current   carseats   while   in   their   winter   coats   we   can   t   buckle   the   seats   without   crushing   them .   i   refused   and   was   so   passionate   about   keeping   them   in   a   5   point   harness   that   i   wound   up   yelling   at   him   with   tears   for   all   the   little   kids   who   have   lost   their   lives   while   being   in   a   booster .   our   kids   are   5.5   years   old   and   small .   they   are   about   33   lbs .   and   40   inches   so   lean   but   too   tall   now   for   the   toddler   seats .   thank   you   to   all   the   families   who   have   shared   their   stories   and   helped   educate   the   rest   of   us .   and   thank   you   britax   for   making   this   amazing   car   seat .
i   never   thought   i   would   get   bath   seats ,   but   love   them   for   twins !   i   was   so   hesitant   in   ordering   these   seats ,   but   i   am   so   glad   i   did .   the   other   reviews   said   how   helpful   they   were   for   bathing   more   than   one   small   child   at   once .   i   was   worried   my   boys   wouldn   t   like   them   and   would   feel   restrained .   i   couldn   t   have   been   more   wrong .   they   love   them !   they   are   now   one   and   have   been   using   them   for   over   6   months .   i   went   with   this   design   since   it   has   the   slanted   front   that   allows   the   boys   to   lean   comfortably   to   splash   or   reach   for   toys .   the   seats   do   float   up   or   move   pretty   easily   when   you   try   to   put   them   in   since   they   only   have   suctions   cups   and   we   have   a   textured   surface   on   our   bathtub .   this   is   not   an   issue   since   they   are   always   supervised .   we   would   not   be   able   to   give   them   baths   at   the   same   time   so   easily   any   other   way .   they   were   also   great   for   the   summer   time .   we   took   them   to   the   beach   house   in   the   summer   and   they   doubled   as   safety   seats   in   the   plastic   swimming   pool   when   there   were   not   enough   hands   to   hold   both .   they   probably   could   even   be   used   as   feeding   chairs   when   traveling   if   need   be .   our   boys   will   be   out   of   them   soon   once   they   figure   out   how   to   try   to   get   out   of   them   and   stand   up   in   the   tub .   we   have   gotten   so   much   use   out   of   them   and   they   are   easy   to   clean   and   hang   dry .
dreambaby   gate   this   gate   does   the   job   well .   my   1   yr   old   daughter   even   shakes   it   from   time   to   time   and   it   hasn   t   budged   yet !   it   can   easily   be   opened   with   one   hand   and   slides   open   and   or   swings   open .   the   only   bad   thing   so   far   is   the   wood   finish   is   rubbing   off   at   the   top   and   bottom   of   the   gate   where   it   latches ,   not   horrible   but   it   is   noticeable .   the   price   was   very   reasonable   too .   br   br   update   4   2016   we   are   still   using   this   gate   for   child   3 .   we   took   it   down   a   few   times   in   between   kids .   it   was   very   easy   to   remove   and   then   put   back   up   again .   continues   to   slides   open   and   closed   easily .   the   latch   is   a   little   difficult   to   use   at   first   but   that   also   prevents   other   children   from   opening   the   gate   for   babies   toddlers .   my   5.5   year   old   daughter   is   able   to   open   the   latch   but   my   3.5   y . o .   son   cannot   open .
recaro   is   best   i   have   the   recaro   seat   for   two   years   now   and   my   daughter   loves   it   not   only   does   she   like   its   comfort   but   she   likes   having   the   same   kind   of   seat   her   mom   and   dad   use   my   evo   has   recaro   seats   and   they   are   great   when   i   saw   recaro   made   baby   seats   it   was   a   no   brainer   i   immediately   bought   one   it   installs   in   less   than   a   minute   securely .   the   best   features   are   ones   you   hope   you   never   need   like   the   soft   yet   firm   side   crash   protectors   great   if   your   car   has   side   airbags   which   can   harm   a   child   without   side   supports   and   also   shoulder   pads   to   help   prevent   the   harness   from   rubbing   the   kids   face   and   the   best   one   yet   the   crotch   pad   which   my   daughter   thinks   is   a   toy   and   yanks   it   off   tosses   it   at   me   laughing   every   time   while   im   strapping   her   in .   basically   its   a   great   safe   light   weight   good   looking   seat   that   can   be   used   for   your   child   on   an   airplane !   yes   you   read   correctly   an   airplane   since   small   children   dont   fit   in   standard   airplane   seats   they   can   and   do   use   this   seat   for   air   travel !
great   multi   purpose   cloth   this   is   a   great   multi   purpose   cloth .   uses   include   diapers   i   prefer   other   brands   of   cloth   diapers   but   these   work   okay .   burp   cloth   these   make   great   burp   cloths .   they   cover   a   larger   area   then   traditional   burp   cloths   and   are   very   absorbent .   wash   rag   i   use   these   to   wash   my   son   s   face   and   hands   after   he   eats .   they   work   great .   peekaboo   my   son   loves   playing   peekaboo   with   these .   they   re   small   enough   and   light   enough   that   they   re   easy   for   him   to   pull   on   off   his   face   to   play   peekaboo   with   us .   cleaning   rags   once   we   re   done   using   these   for   my   son   they   ll   make   great   cleaning   rags .   the   cloths   start   off   very   stiff   and   get   softer   as   you   wash   them .   i   would   recommend   washing   them   at   least   3   4   times   before   you   use   them .   even   after   repeated   washings   they   are   still   somewhat   stiff .   the   texture   is   closer   to   a   washcloth   then   a   blanket .
a   good   food   jar   the   food   jar   i   bought   can   keep   food   warm   after   a   half   day   and   is   leak   proof   just   as   introduced .   i   think   it   is   also   good   looking . in   weekdays ,   my   two   and   half   year   old   son   takes   it   to   care   center   and   in   weekend   when   i   take   my   son   to   museums   or   other   playing   places , i   bring   it   with   warm   food ,   and   it   s   very   useful .   today   i   bought   another   pink   one   and   hope   it   is   also   in   the   same   good   quality .
great   product   i   really   liked   these .   i   was   skeptical   at   first   because ,   when   i   first   pulled   them   out   of   the   package ,   they   were   almost   as   thin   as   bed   sheets .   after   about   5   washes   they   quilted   nicely .   i   would   recommend   them   to   anyone !   and   i   am   a   first   time   mom ,   first   time   cloth   diapering ,   first   time   using   prefolds .
love   these   spoons   i   bought   these   for   my   10   month   old   and   am   very   happy   with   them .   they   hold   just   the   right   amount   of   food   and   it   doesn   t   spill   off   the   sides .   perfect   size .   nice   to   hold   and   work   with .   easy   to   clean .   they   are   my   favorite   spoons   so   far .
ok ,   but   .....   i   bought   the   swing   for   pumping   milk   after   my   third   baby .   my   previous   pump ,   an   avent ,   had   broken   and   from   the   reviews   i   was   led   to   believe   the   medela   swing   would   be   better .   its   ok   a   bit   better   than   the   avent   but   not   enough   to   justify   the   extra   cost .   the   suction   is   less   than   i   would   have   wanted   and   also   loses   strength   if   you   use   just   battery   power .   the   pumping   tubes   do   not   secure   well   into   the   pump   or   bottle   so   have   a   tendency   to   slip   out   a   very   irritating   design   fault .   condensation   forms   in   the   tubes   quickly   and   can   go   mouldy .   it   does   the   job   but   with   a   bit   of   tinkering   by   the   medela   design   team ,   it   could   work   even   better .
sleep   please !   the   only   problem   i   have   with   this   product   is   that   it   just   isn   t   loud   enough .   i   love   the   way   you   can   combine   sounds   and   the   size   of   the   machine   fits   perfect   on   my   bedside   table .
space   saver   love   this   drying   rack .   it   s   adorable ,   uses   very   little   space ,   spins   to   stack   baby   bottles   and   such ,   and   it   s   also   very   affordable .   it   is   one   of   my   favorite   baby   items .   everytime   i   use   it ,   i   think   about   how   happy   i   am   that   i   have   purchased   it .
leaks ,   leaks ,   leaks   but   keep   milk   cold .   i   have   such   a   love   hate   relationship   with   this   cup .   love ... the   fact   that   it   keeps   milk   cold   for   a   long   time .   i   don   t   have   to   stress   about   giving   my   son   spoiled   milk .   i   can   t   find   another   cup   that   keep   things   cold   like   this   one   so   i   continue   to   use   it .   hate ... that   it   leaks   soooooooooo   much .   my   son   14   months   has   actually   created   a   game   with   the   cup   to   see   how   much   milk   he   can   get   out .   once   he   was   in   the   other   room   for   a   few   minutes ,   i   walked   in   and   it   looked   like   someone   had   just   killed   the   milkman .   milk   all   over   the   floor   and   walls .   i   called   thermos   to   complain   about   the   leaking .   they   sent   me   a   new   top   with   assurance   it   would   fix   the   problem .   the   new   lid   did   the   exact   same   thing .
good   quailty   but   doesn   t   work   for   my   son   i   ve   been   trying   to   use   it   on   my   son   for   a   week .   claims   it   s   90   effective   so   my   son   must   be   the   10   .   shipping   and   quality   were   great .
great   output ... though   a   bit   painful ....   after   reading   the   other   reviews   i   was   so   excited   to   get   these ....   pumping   seven   or   eight   times   a   day ,   my   nipples   were   getting   quite   sore .... however ....   i   do   not   agree   with   many   of   the   reviewers   about   these   causing   less   pain ... in   fact ,   i   find   these   hurt   my   breasts   with   their   massaging   really   the   plastic   is   just   a   little   more   flexible   than   the   others   so   they   flex   a   little   at   the   cone   part ,   hence   massaging   the   nipple   after   the   first   time   i   thought   i   was   going   to   have   to   trash   them .... but   then   i   compared   the   amount   of   milk   i   got   using   them ,   and   it   was   almost   double   that   of   the   typical   medela   shields .... so   i   tried   again ,   and   on   a   lighter   suction ,   at   a   faster   pace ,   and   they   were   more   tolerable .   and   to   get   such   a   better   output .... i   suppose   i   can   put   up   with   the   pain .   i   now   alternate   between   the   two   types   of   shields .   i   also   notice   when   i   m   more   full   i   should   go   with   the   traditional   ones ,   as   the   massaging   shields   hurt   too   badly .   if   you   can   stick   with   them ,   through   the   initial   discomfort ,   the   amount   of   milk   you   gain ,   and   in   my   case   can   freeze   for   future   use ,   is   worth   it .   i   would   not   suggest   washing   these   in   the   dishwasher   however .... they   are   a   hand   wash   wipe   only   item   else   the   shape   will   distort .   i   even   notice   after   wearing   them   each   time   the   shape   changes   a   bit   and   so   i   rotate   them   each   time   on   the   attachments .
in   my   opinion ,   a   must   have   for   pregnancy .   after   my   first   pregnancy   plagued   me   with   many   sleepless   nights ,   and   achy   hips   and   backs ,   i   decided   i   needed   to   try   a   body   pillow ,   despite   my   hesitancy   to   fork   out   50   bucks   for   a   pillow .   but   i   am   so   glad   i   splurged .   i   began   using   this   in   my   first   trimester ,   and   slept   like   a   baby   right   up   through   delivery .   i   never   had   a   problem   with   achy   hips   or   back   and   was   always   comfortable ,   despite   gaining   more   weight   with   this   pregnancy   too !   the   pillow   is   big   though ,   and   might   make   your   sleeping   partner   uncomfortable   if   you   have   a   small   bed ,   but   for   my   california   king ,   there   was   still   room   for   my   1   year   old   to   sleep   with   us   too !   if   you   value   comfort   and   high   quality   sleep   despite   all   the   discomforts   of   pregnancy ,   i   highly   recommend   this   body   pillow .
ok   not   great   this   is   soft   enough   to   use   on   it   s   own   as   a   cover .   as   such   it   s   one   of   the   most   inexpensive   covers   you   can   buy   for   the   boppy .   unfortunately   it   only   provides   slightly   more   protection   then   a   regular   boppy   cover .   it   takes   a   little   bit   longer   for   the   pee   poop   spit   up   to   get   through   but   it   will   still   get   through   unless   you   change   the   cover   within   a   few   minutes   of   the   time   your   baby   pees   poops   spits   up   on   it .   br   br   if   you   really   want   to   stop   liquid   from   getting   through   to   your   boppy   i   would   recommend   putting   a   large   waterproof   lap   pad   over   the   boppy .   this   is   much   more   effective   at   stopping   liquid   and   it   also   makes   clean   up   a   lot   easier   because   you   don   t   have   to   hassle   with   getting   the   cover   on   off   the   boppy .
pretty   good   i   purchased   these   bags   twice   intead   of   some   type   of   expensive   diaper   genie .   super   stinky   diapers   still   need   to   be   double   bagged   like   after   baby   starts   to   eat   food   ,   but   overall   i   am   happy   with   these .
great   diaper   pail   system   for   our   family   this   is   our   first   diaper   pail   we   ve   ever   purchased ,   but   we   love   it .   yes ,   it   s   not   that   large   as   other   reviewers   have   said ,   but   i   like   to   keep   things   tidy   in   my   house   so   we   typically   take   out   the   diaper   trash   within   2   3   days .   if   you   fold   the   dirty   diaper   and   close   the   velcro   flaps   over   the   waste ,   it   is   more   compact   and   you   can   stuff   quite   a   bit   of   diapers   into   the   pail .   when   my   little   one   was   a   newborn ,   if   we   got   lazy ,   it   would   easily   store   up   to   5   days   of   diapers ,   but   when   she   got   older   it   went   down   to   about   2   3   days .   we   used   about   7   8   newborn   diapers   a   day   and   now   about   5   6   size   2   or   3   diapers   6   mos   old   a   day .   it   does   keep   the   odor   in   without   any   issue   some   odor   will   escape   but   it   is   transient .   i   like   that   fact   that   i   can   use   this   diaper   system   as   a   trash   can   in   her   room   in   the   future .   also ,   you   can   use   as   much   or   as   little   of   the   liner   that   you   want .   we   ve   bought   refills   for   the   diaper   dekor ,   but   we   haven   t   needed   to   use   the   refills   yet   almost   7   months   .   it   s   also   easy   to   change   out   the   diapers   and   you   don   t   have   to   touch   the   diapers   at   all !   great   and   convenient   for   those   on   a   budget   and   don   t   mind   changing   out   the   liners   a   little   more   often .   i   wouldn   t   want   poop   in   my   bedroom   over   a   week   anyway   let   alone   my   baby   s   .   it   s   a   keeper   for   our   family .
granddaughter   loves   this .   tiffany   fell   in   love   with   this . it   makes   noise   its   softer   to   the   touch . and   the   most   important   thing   it   blue   and   blue   is   her   favorite   color .
very   pleased   i   purchased   this   item   for   my   little   guy   just   yesterday   and   love   it .   it   is   so   super   easy   to   use .   other   portable ,   table   top   highchairs   are   not   so   easy   to   use   in   my   experience .   plus ,   it   is   very   sturdy   and   made   well .   i   am   very   happy   with   this   purchase !
love   it   we   have   5   kids .   we   have   tried   about   every   snack   cup   out   there .   this   one   is   our   favorite .   it   keeps   the   snacks   in   the   cup   and   off   the   floor .   now   if   my   wife   would   just   use   them   at   the   house ... hope   she   doesn   t   read   that .  
good   blanket   replacement .   bought   this   for   our   son ,   who   has   the   habit   of   kicking   away   his   blanket   with   surprising   precision   a   problem   when   temperature   falls   in   the   house   during   this   time   of   the   year .   br   while   it   is ,   of   course ,   entirely   random   whether   a   child   will   accept   a   sleeping   bag   or   wearable   blanket   ,   we   lucked   out   and   he   did   not   reject   it .   in   fact ,   he   likes   it   and   gets   unhappy   when   you   remove   it   in   the   morning .   br   br   the   product   100   cotton   as   advertised ,   easily   washable   and   doesn   t   get   too   hot .   the   zippers   work   without   getting   stuck .   br   br   short   product   works .   baby   happy ,   parents   happy .
babies   first   toy   my   daughter   loves   these   rings .   we   took   them   apart   made   numerous   rings   w   just   2   3   rings   each .   she   loves   to   chew   on   them .
didn   t   cut   it .   nearly   every   one   we   had   must   have   been   defective .   the   frames   bent   easily   and   stayed   bent   and   yes ,   i   know   the   sides   are   supposed   to   bend   and   then   snap   into   position   but   it   was   more   than   that ... they   stayed   bent   .   br   br   also ,   if   you   put   this   up ,   plan   on   keeping   it   up .   i   would   describe   this   more   as   a   permanent   solution   rather   than   an   easy   to   remove   and   put   up   travel   gate .   from   the   reviews   here ,   it   is   clear   that   some   people   love   this   but   it   just   didn   t   work   for   our   lifestyle .   br   br   pre   tested   before   baby   came   as   well   as   with   a   friend   s   baby .   totally   frustrating   and   we   followed   the   directions   perfectly .   as   others   have   noted ,   the   directions   are   not   easy   to   follow   and   you   have   to   practice   to   understand   how   to   get   this   to   work .   even   so ,   after   extending   the   top   and   bottom   sides ,   placing   the   gate   on   the   floor   a   required   step   according   to   manufacturer   instructions   and   then   locking   it   in   place ,   we   were   extremely ... well ,   grumpy .   further   practice   didn   t   make   things   any   better .   i   would   never   use   this   as   a   portable   baby   gate !   br   br   uh   uh .   looking   for   something   simpler .   i   would   avoid   using   this   after   going   through   so   many   steps   each   time !   again ,   for   a   permanent   or   long   term   gate   for   crawlers   to   first   walkers   ,   this   might   work ... as   a   travel   gate ,   nope ... not   from   what   i   experienced .
doesn   t   work   for   younger   babies   this   teether   does   not   work   well   for   younger   babies .   here   s   why   doesn   t   fit   well   in   mouth   this   teether   is   too   wide   to   fit   comfortable   into   my   son   s   mouth   he   s   six   months   .   at   best   he   can   use   it   on   his   front   teeth   and   even   this   is   difficult   for   him .   even   as   he   gets   bigger   i   think   the   teether   will   still   be   too   big   to   comfortably   reach   his   back   teeth .   difficult   to   hold   manipulate   the   length   of   this   teether   about   6   1   2   inches   and   the   fact   that   it   twists   makes   it   very   difficult   for   me   son   to   hold   this   and   get   it   into   his   mouth   on   his   own .   too   hard   heavy   like   most   young   babies   my   son   manages   to   hit   himself   in   the   head   with   just   about   anything   he   can   get   his   hands   on .   this   teether   is   made   out   of   a   hard   plastic   type   material   and   is   fairly   thick   meaning   it   can   definitely   leave   a   mark   if   your   child   hits   him   herself   with   it .   i   think   that   this   teether   would   work   pretty   well   for   older   babies .   the   rings   make   a   nice   rattling   sound   to   capture   a   babies   attention   and   an   older   baby   would   probably   enjoy   twisting   the   teether   around   and   sliding   the   rings   around   the   teether .
terrible   quality   these   brushes   are   terrible   quality   the   sponge   tip   shreds   within   days ,   and   the   wire   part   slides   into   the   handle .   also ,   the   bristles   are   stiff   so   you   get   spattered   with   soapy   water   when   you   pull   the   brush   out   of   the   bottle .   we   bought   3   or   4   of   these   brushes ,   used   them   for   a   week   or   so ,   then   threw   them   out .   finally   i   got   smart   and   bought   the   oxo   steel   bottle   brush   for   a   few   dollars   more   it   s   perfect ! !   it   s   lasted   several   weeks   already   without   any   sign   of   wear .   save   yourself   the   trouble   and   buy   the   oxo   steel   bottle   brush   make   sure   it   s   the   steel   one ,   though ,   not   the   plastic   one .
very   unhappy   we   purchased   our   diaper   champ   in   2009   due   to   the   many   great   reviews   however   we   ve   had   several   issues   that   have   caused   us   to   stop   using   it .   i   ve   heard   there   is   a   newer   model   however   the   older   one   is   still   available   as   well .   the   biggest   issue ,   and   one   i   m   surprised   i   haven   t   seen   any   comments   on   is   that   if   a   kitchen   garbage   bag   is   filled   or   even   3   4   full   it   is   essentially   impossible   to   remove   it   without   tearing   the   bag   open .   the   top   of   the   diaper   champ   is   significantly   smaller   than   the   bottom   so   as   diapers   are   deposited   they   spread   out   in   the   bottom   and   as   you   pull   the   bag   out   it   has   to   compress   to   be   extracted .   there   are   several   plastic   edges   for   the   bag   to   catch   on   and   almost   always   do .   the   only   solution   we   ve   found   is   to   only   fill   the   bags   1   4   of   the   way   allowing   room   to   compress   the   diapers   and   remove   them .   it   s   a   horrible   waste   of   bags .   we   ve   also   tried   using   plastic   grocery   bags   since   they   are   much   smaller .   it   works   but   they   don   t   reach   the   bottom   of   the   container   and   sometimes   fall .   they   also   require   emptying   every   day .   if   someone   has   a   better   way   please   comment .   it   really   doesn   t   do   a   great   job   of   covering   smells   either .   it   seems   to   contain   infant   smells   adequately   but   for   6   month   old   s   or   older   it   s   completely   inadequate .   we   too   just   throw   them   in   the   garbage   for   our   18   month   old .
love   this   product ! ! !   when   my   two   year   old   got   to   long   for   her   toddler   bed   we   went   and   ordered   the   metal   bed   rails   that   slide   under   the   mattress   that   was   a   disaster   ! ! ! ! ! !   we   then   started   looking   at   this   product   and   decided   to   give   it   a   try   .   we   are   sooo   glad   we   did   ! ! ! ! ! !   this   in   an   absolute   amazing   product   nooo   metal   bars   ,   no   worrying   about   your   child   falling   between   the   matress   and   the   bed   rail ,   and   sooo   easy   to   make   the   bed .   the   only   thing   i   would   caution   people   on   is   to   make   sure   your   sheets   are   very   tight ,   we   put   ours   on   under   her   matress   protector   and   my   210pd .   husband   can   move   all   around   and   they   will   not   move ! ! ! ! ! !   sum   up   great   product   highly   recommend   ! ! !
i   love   this   product ,   just   wish   there   were   corner   covers   too !   i   ordered   this   after   one   of   my   boys   started   chewing   on   his   crib   rail .   with   the   new   design   of   cribs ,   this   is   a   must .   i   wish   i   would   have   had   these   earlier ,   but   i   did   not   think   of   them .   they   would   make   a   good   shower   gift .   the   only   flaw   is   that   the   corners   are   not   covered   and   that   is   where   my   boys   chew .   it   is   hard   to   protect   the   entire   crib   from   chewers .   i   am   happy   though   that   it   is   limiting   the   chewing   to   the   side   rails   at   the   exposed   corners ,   since   these   will   not   be   part   of   the   full   bed   when   they   are   older .   there   is   only   one   bite   mark   on   the   front   rail   since   i   did   not   get   these   in   time   before   the   first   bite .   i   now   know   better .   with   2   cribs   to   try   to   preserve ,   these   are   worth   the   price .   my   boys   like   to   chew   on   them   and   the   thick   padding   protects   the   wood .   it   also   provides   cushion   for   their   heads .
precious   night ,   comforting   light   i   would   ve   loved   to   have   had   one   of   these   when   i   was   little   i   m   sure   it   would   ve   helped   me   with   my   huge   fear   of   the   dark   back   then .   br   br   basically ,   this   precious   turtle   transforms   the   plain   dark   into   a   starry   night .   these   are   like   cut   out   stars ,   not   little   dots   like   a   planetarium .   not   sure   it   offers   much   educational   value ,   but   it   sure   is   a   treasure   to   look   at .
light   weight ,   compact   and   grandson   loves   it   this   walker   is   light   weight   and   folds   down   easily   for   storage .   it   was   perfect   for   my   grandson   who   wasn   t   quite   sitting   up   yet .   provided   back   support   and   is   entertaining   to   him .
defeats   the   purpose ! not   a   car   seat   cover   , just   a   fancy   blanket . i   should   have   looked   closer   at   the   picture .   i   bought   this   product   for   my   new   baby   because   i   liked   the   reviews   on   it   , the   biggest   problem   with   it   that   is   not   a   car   seat   cover   , , it   is   a   fancy   blanket   , so   it   will   keep   your   baby   cozy   and   warm   but   you   can   not   cover   the   whole   car   seat   and   seal   the   cold   weather   out   and   have   a   little   window   in   there   for   your   baby   to   look   through   and   breath   through , i   guess   i   should   have   looked   closer   at   the   picture   of   the   product , so   unfortunately   i   will   have   to   buy   another   one   that   would   help   in   the   colder   weather , this   one   maybe   for   the   cold   summer   nights   or   as   a   simple   blanket   . the   material   is   nice   though   and   i   like   the   design .
warm   and   cozy   nicely   made .   its   warm   and   cozy .   my   daughter   loves   it .   probably   going   to   end   up   with   another   one   shortly .   highly   recommend   it   during   winter .
my   daughter   loves   her   bumble   bee   lunch   bag !   for   the   price ,   this   lunchbag   is   worth   it .   its   cute ,   fun   and   your   child   will   love   it .   holds   just   the   right   amount   of   food   for   a   child .
simple   to   use   and   does   the   job   these   are   simple   to   use   and   do   the   job   as   promised   odor   knock   down   .   the   price   is   ok ,   the   packaging   is   nice ,   the   size   is   perfect ,   and   the   effect   is   priceless .   much   better   than   having   to   sift   the   regular   a   h   boxes .   we   use   ours   as   stickies   next   to   the   cat   boxes   and   under   the   bathroom   sinks .
soooo   great !   this   is   a   very   quality   item   and   i   am   sooo   happy   i   ordered   it .   we   have   a   play   yard   that   has   the   top   part   turn   into   a   basinet   for   baby   to   sleep   in .   obviously   it   came   with   just   a   plain   cover   and   i   couldn   t   imagine   having   a   baby   sleep   on   that ... so   we   ordered   this   and   it   s   sooooooo   soft   and   kind   of   thick   so   it   gives   a   little   padding   for   baby .   highly   recommend .   i   ordered   the   pink   and   it   s   perfect !
great   bottles   for   breast   feeding   baby   the   good   things   of   these   bottle   are   first ,   the   flow   of   size   1   nipple   is   really   slow ,   my   babies   can   not   tell   the   flow   difference   between   the   bottle   and   mommy   s   nipple .   my   two   babies   don   t   have   any   problem   on   transition   from   breast   feeding   to   bottle   feeding .   second ,   it   does   reduce   gas ,   my   baby   girl   is   a   easy   spit   up   girl   but   this   bottle   helps .   the   only   concern   is   the   bottle   need   more   time   to   clean   the   extra   part   and   you   need   two   kinds   of   brushes   to   clean   the   bottle .
i   guess   i   won   t   be   buying   it   i   was   going   to   buy   this   sterilizer ,   but   after   reading   many   reviews   saying   the   unit   broke   down   right   after   the   90   day   warrenty ,   or   before   it   was   a   year   old ,   i   now   don   t   be   getting   it .   for   over   50   bucks   it   had   damn   well   better   work   for   over   a   year !   br   br   oh   well .   back   to   searching ....
evenflow   carseat   i   like   this   carseat   for   my   son .   he   was   getting   to   big   for   his   other   carseat   so   we   switched   and   i   ended   up   finding   this   one .   i   would   recommend   this   one   to   a   friend .   the   only   flaw   about   this   carseat   is   that   my   son   falls   asleep   in   it   and   his   head   is   constantly   going   forward .   also   the   head   padding   part   doesn   t   move   and   you   have   to   kind   of   move   it   up   in   order   to   starp   him   in   and   it   s   not   adjustable .   other   than   that   it   s   a   pretty   good   carseat   he   can   look   out   and   he   loves   it .
great   but   does   not   fit   all   cribs   ok .   had   to   come   back   and   edit   my   original   review .   initially ,   i   was   really   disappointed   because ,   while   it   s   advertised   as   for   convertible   cribs ,   it   really   does   not   fit   all   convertible   cribs .   we   received   it   on   a   saturday   in   the   mail ,   and   when   we   saw   the   disclaimer   inside   in   the   instructions ,   we   were   let   down .   our   daughter ,   at   17   months ,   effectively   mastered   the   art   of   climbing   out   of   her   crib ,   regardless   of   us   putting   her   mattress   at   her   lowest   setting .   saturday   we   did   not   set   it   up   because   our   crib   is   a   solid   back   and   it   s   not   designed   for   it .   after   a   long   night   on   saturday ,   and   our   daughter   climbing   out   and   bruising   the   inside   of   her   thigh ,   arm ,   and   upper   chest   as   she   rubbed   the   weight   of   her   body   over   the   wooden   crib ,   we   had   to   do   something .   back   to   the   crib   tent .   keep   in   mind .   it   s   not   supposed   to   fit   our   crib   because   of   the   solid   back .   i   read   somewhere   else   how   another   customer   tried   it   out   and   it   still   fit .   why   because   of   the   rungs   on   the   ends   of   the   crib .   we   set   it   up .   the   vertical   straps   fit   to   secure   it   down   on   the   4   corners .   the   front   is   strapped   down .   the   sides   are   strapped   down .   and   the   tent   rests   over   the   edges   of   the   crib .   the   only   place   that   we   can   t   strap   the   few   velcro   straps   are   along   the   back .   we   needed   to   at   least   try .   and   i   m   glad   we   did .   our   daughter   cried   at   first ...   because   she   realized   she   couldn   t   climb   out .   sweet   peace .   while   she   d   want   to   be   stubborn ,   climb   out ,   and   fight   us   to   fall   asleep , ...   this   product   prevents   it ...   keeps   her   safe   as   she   s   not   trying   to   go   mcguiver   and   jump   out ...   and ...   well ...   two   words .   it   works ! ! !   only   put   4   stars   because   i   really   do   think   they   should   expand   their   line   to   fit   more   cribs ...   or ,   more   specifically ,   be   detailed   enough   so   the   customers   don   t   waste   time   getting   a   product   that   might   not   fit   their   crib   very   well   .
best   potty   seat   i   purchased   this   in   oct .   2009   when   i   was   beginning   to   pt   my   son .   i   had   used   a   potty   chair   with   my   daughter   and   hated   cleaning   it .   this   was   perfect   for   my   little   boy   to   begin   using   the   potty .   now   two   years   later   he   still   uses   it   to   poop .   he   is   almost   4   and   stands   to   pee ,   but   puts   this   on   all   by   himself   when   he   has   to   poop .   it   is   still   great ,   despite   my   initial   thoughts   that   it   seemed   flimsy   and   wouldn   t   last .   it   has   lasted   2   plus   years   and   still   works   like   day   one .   it   fits   fine   on   our   elongated   toilet   both   with   seat   up   or   down .   and   the   only   drawback   was   that   when   he   was   learning   to   pee   sitting   down ,   sometimes   it   would   leak   out   underneath   if   he   didn   t   point   down   enough .   not   a   huge   deal ,   but   that   was   the   one   downside .   other   than   that   this   has   been   a   great   seat ! ! !

even   better   than   i   thought   it   would   be !   this   memory   book   is   a   3   ring   binder ,   which   allows   you   to   add   more   pages .   it   comes   with   quite   a   few   pages   that   are   so   adorable !   theres   pages   for   family   tree ,   all   about   mommy   and   daddy ,   baby   shower ,   sonogram   photo   area ,   pages   for   firsts   and   favorites ,   not   to   mention   birthdays   1   5   years   and   more !   it   s   also   a   lot   prettier   in   person   than   the   picture ,   and   all   the   pages   are   very   pretty .   i   highly   recommend   this   if   you   are   looking   for   an   all   in   one   type   album .   its   a   memory   album ,   scrapbook ,   and   photo   album   in   one !
great   car   seat !   our   little   guy   was   getting   too   tall   for   his   infant   seat ,   so   we   decided   to   upgrade   him   to   a   convertible   one   at   7   months .   after   reading   tons   of   reviews   and   doing   tons   of   research   i   found   this   one   to   be   affordable ,   safe   and   have   a   smaller   profile   than   some   of   the   others .   it   seems   comfortable   for   our   boy ,   it   spot   cleans   great ,   and   was   easy   to   install .   if   you   re   a   little   ocd ,   doing   hours   of   research   like   i   did ,   search   no   longer ,   and   get   this   one  
what   wakes   you   more   your   baby   or   this   unit   s   static   i   bought   this   monitor   because   of   the   mostly   positive   reviews   that   i   saw   about   it   and   the   reasonable   price .   i   tried   it   out   with   the   baby   sleeping   in   his   room   and   the   monitor   in   the   living   room ,   and   it   seemed   to   work   well .   so ,   i   threw   away   all   the   packaging   and   was   all   set   for   the   night   my   baby   would   first   sleep   in   his   crib .   as   i   said   before ,   the   product   works   nicely   in   my   living   room .   once   i   set   foot   into   my   bedroom   it   is   a   very   different   story .   even   thought   the   monitor   is   in   the   voice   activated   mode ,   all   you   get   is   static   and   snaps   and   pops   from   this   thing   every   two   seconds .   i   have   tried   probably   all   the   different   combinations   of   settings   and   they   all   give   you   the   feedback .   most   nights ,   after   many   attempts ,   i   can   find   just   the   right   place   in   the   room   so   the   monitor   stays   quiet .   however ,   the   place   changes   from   night   to   night   and   sometimes   even   during   the   night !   all   said ,   i   wish   that   i   had   saved   the   packaging   and   would   have   been   able   to   return   this .   it   would   be   well   worth   spending   a   little   more   money   on   a   different   monitor   so   that   i   could   get   more   sleep .
great   formula   warmer   this   bottle   warmer   works   great .   i   love   the   fact   that   it   is   very   easy   to   operate ,   warms   bottle   very   fast   and   evenly .   i   also   like   the   fact   that   you   can   sanitize   pacifiers .   it   doesnt   really   take   much   time   to   do
awesome   high   chair !   i   researched   high   chairs   forever !   i   had   heard   so   many   things   about   bad   fabric ,   poor   design ,   ease   of   use   that   i   wanted   to   make   sure   we   got   our   choice   right   since   we   will   be   using   this   high   chair   for   a   long   time .   and   i   overanalyze   everything .   first   of   all ,   the   fabric   is   easy   to   clean .   spilled   prune   juice   on   it   and   i   didn   t   notice   for   a   couple   hours   and   it   came   right   out   with   water .   i   also   really   like   that   the   entire   fabric   portion   is   easy   to   remove   and   can   be   thrown   in   the   washing   machine .   there   are   handles   to   release   the   tray   on   the   sides   and   front ,   which   is   really   convenient .   the   harness   system   works   really   well ,   and   it   s   easy   to   strap   them   in .   the   top   portion   of   the   tray   come   completely   off   and   fits   in   a   dishwasher .   it   is   on   wheels   which   i   found   to   be   very   handy .   the   whole   back   of   the   seat   reclines ,   which   is   great   to   use   while   learning   to   drink   from   a   sippy   cup .   the   height   of   it   is   adjustable   too .   i   haven   t   removed   the   seat   portion   yet ,   but   when   we   go   on   vacation   we   will   be   taking   it   with   us ,   and   i   love   having   that   option .   overall ,   awesome   highchair   and   the   price   is   great .   and   like   i   said ,   we   looked   at   them   everywhere   for   months   and   i   did   a   lot   of   research !
absorbant   and   soft !   i   really   like   these .   after   previously   using   the   thirsties   hemp   inserts ,   we   decided   to   try   these   babykicks   when   we   needed   to   up   our   stash   of   hemp .   we   love   these .   not   only   do   they   absorb   more ,   in   volume ,   that   the   thirsties   brand ,   but   they   are   thinner   and   dry   faster .   our   little   one   is   only   12   weeks   old ,   and   the   small   is   the   perfect   size   insert   for   her   pocket   diapers .   as   she   grows ,   we   can   always   still   use   it   as   a   doubler .
great   deal   on   an   awesome   product ! !   this   is   a   great   deal   on   a   time   saving   product   for   babies   who   love   to   be   swaddled !   we   just   discovered   the   swaddleme   blanket   for   our   10   week   old   and   only   wish   we   had   found   it   sooner .   the   blanket   allows   you   to   tightly   and   easily   swaddle   the   baby   s   arms   with   a   soft   velcro   closure   and   let   baby   s   legs   be   looser   and   comfortable .   we   got   three   of   these   for   15.99   which   is   a   steal   considering   we   paid   12.99   for   just   one   of   these   blankets   last   week   at   babies   r   us .   this   is   a   must   have   for   infants ! !
diaper   kit   is   great   this   diaper   changing   kit   is   a   great   size ,   fits   everything   i   need ,   even   cloth   diapers ,   and   easy   to   wipe   down .   it   does   become   a   bit   bulky   and   is   hard   to   close   when   filled   with   diapers   and   wipes ,   but   i   still   love   it .   it   goes   with   me   everywhere !
perfect   i   needed   a   gift   for   my   niece   who   is   expecting   twin   girls .   these   soft   little   dolls   will   be   perfect   crib   mates   for   the   new   babies .   very   soft ,   colorful ,   and   just   the   right   size .   very   happy   with   these   dolls !
great   for   on   the   go ,   only .   i   bought   these   bags   while   waiting   on   my   subscription   for   my   genie   refills   to   arrive .   they   are   great   little   bags   for   on   the   go   and   they   smell   great .   i   actually   used   it   90   at   home .   i   would   put   the   used   diaper   in   the   bag ,   double   tied   it   and   throw   it   in   my   diaper   genie .   once   i   went   to   empty   the   genie ,   it   was   the   worst   smell .   i   do   not   recommend   it   for   using   it   as   a   replacement   for   diaper   genie   bags .   but   out   on   the   go   it   is   perfect ,   and   taking   a   trip   over   familys   house   or   something   like   that .   it   is   perfect   for   that
stork   craft   venetian   crib   we   bought   this   bed   for   our   second   child .   i   don   t   think   she   s   old   enough   to   appreciate   it   yet ,   but   the   bed   pleases   us .   it   is   surprisingly   well   built ,   the   paint   doesn   t   come   off   so   easily   like   our   first   child   s   bed .   i   tried   to   peel   back   a   small   section   on   the   underside   all   in   all   it   is   a   well   crafted   bed .   it   s   rigid   and   sturdy .   the   colour   is   true   to   the   photo   in   the   listing .   we   re   pleased   with   it .
baby   approved   my   mother   in   law   just   bought   it   for   my   5.5   months   old   baby   girl .   she   did   not   take   it   out   of   her   mouth   for   2   hours !   i   think   her   razberry   has   some   serious   competition .
love   this !   i   never   thought   i   d   like   a   velcro   cloth   diaper   so   much .   it   actually   works   really   well .   my   baby   couldn   t   really   fit   into   it   until   she   was   just   over   10   lbs ,   but   once   she   did ,   it   s   our   easiest   diaper   to   use .   the   velcro   is   soft   and   has   held   up   well   in   the   wash .   i   ve   heard   horror   stories   about   velcro   in   other   brands   of   cloth   diapers ,   but   this   brand   seems   to   have   gotten   it   right .   this   diaper   is   probably   the   best   for   when   you   have   someone   else   watching   your   baby   like   a   grandparent   or   something   ,   because   the   velcro   makes   it   easy   for   people   who   aren   t   used   to   using   cloth   diapers .   i   also   love   all   the   cute   designs   these   come   in   and   really   like   how   this   is   an   aio   diaper   with   a   pocket ,   so   you   can   always   stick   another   insert   in   there   for   extra   extra   absorbancy   overnight   maybe ,   or   for   heavy   wetters   ,   but   otherwise ,   it   s   just   fine   on   its   own .
even   grandma   agreed   this   was   incredible   my   daughter   absolutely   loved   this   blanket .   once   you   get   past   how   to   wrap   them   in   it ,   you   will   never   let   it   go   and   panic   when   it   is   in   the   wash .   she   would   sleep   so   much   better   wrapped   in   this   blanket .   grandma   who   is   old   school   thought   this   was   amazing .   we   called   her   the   little   burrito   but   it   worked   perfectly .   after   she   outgrew   it ,   she   still   slept   with   it   as   a   blanket .   every   parent   should   be   issued   one   of   these   when   their   baby   is   born   along   with   the   baby   411   books .   two   of   the   best   products   i   came   across   and   were   invaluable   to   me .
good   quality   at   a   good   price .   bought   these   for   our   9   month   old   when   she   starting   cruising   to   keep   her   from   bonking   her   head   on   the   sharp   corners   of   our   wooden   coffee   table .   these   are   great !   easy   to   put   on   and   stay   put .   they   provide   nice   padding .   a   smart   buy .
definitely   tough .   this   product   is   a   little   awkward   to   adjust ,   which   makes   moving   it   to   different   locations   a   little   annoying .   if   you   re   going   to   leave   it   in   one   place ,   it   s   great .   this   is   the   biggest   gate   i   could   find ,   and   it   is   pretty   tough .   we   use   it   to   contain   our   dogs   in   the   house ,   and   they   have   chewed   on   both   the   wood   and   wire ,   and   it   has   stood   up   well .
the   largest   size   is   a   little   too   big ,   but   otherwise   it   s   a   wonderful   binky !   if   you   can   get   your   baby   to   accept   this   binky ,   this   would   be   a   wonderful   choice !   it   is   natural   rubber   and   i   was   told   that   it   is   latex   free .   being   that   my   husband   has   many   relatives   with   latex   allergies ,   i   don   t   want   to   expose   my   children   to   latex   if   i   don   t   have   to .   br   br   i   love   that   this   is   a   one   piece   design .   i   know   this   sounds   paranoid ,   but   i   can   t   help   worrying   about   other   pacifiers   coming   apart .   it   s   also   very   easy   to   clean   and   doesn   t   get   gunk   built   up   in   it .   i   also   love   that   it   s   made   from   a   natural   material .   i   know   that   the   other   pacifiers   out   there   are   free   of   bpa   and   all ,   but   who   s   to   say   that   there   isn   t   something   else   in   them   that   we   ll   later   learn   isn   t   healthy   it   s   also   nice   to   know   that   my   baby   can   t   shove   these   in   her   mouth .   br   br   these   also   look   very   cute   and   retro .   the   pacifiers   i   used   as   a   baby   back   in   1980   look   nearly   identical .   they   may   not   suit   everyone   s   taste ,   however .   br   br   my   only   gripe   is   that   the   largest   size   12   month   has   a   very   large   bulb   at   the   end .   i   guess   the   best   reference   i   can   think   of   is   that   it   was   quite   a   bit   larger   than   those   round   gerber   binkies .   i   tried   the   largest   size   when   my   baby   was   18   months   and   she   rejected   it   immediately .   i   ve   tried   offering   it   to   her   a   few   times   and   she   just   chews   on   it   a   bit   and   tosses   it   aside .   maybe   my   children   are   just   on   the   sensitive   side ,   but   i   can   t   imagine   that   any   of   them   would   have   accepted   it .   it   s   not   a   big   deal   to   size   down ,   but   since   these   can   get   expensive ,   i   wish   i   had   known   that   before   making   my   purchase .
ok .   this   is   just   for   a   travel   bag   holds   maybe   three   diapers ,   and   i   never   use   the   pacifier   bag .   it   does   hold   diapers   though   and   no   problems   with   leaking .
baby   loves   them   our   baby   required   the   use   of   a   soother   from   the   day   he   was   born   due   to   respiratory   issues .   we   had   a   wubbanub   already   on   hand ,   and   were   happy   to   discover   that   the   nipple   is   the   same   as   is   used   in   many   nicu   s .   having   the   weight   of   the   stuffed   toy   rest   on   his   chest   meant   less   times   of   getting   up   to   replace   the   soother   for   him .   as   he   grew ,   he   was   able   to   grab   the   soother   in   the   middle   of   the   night   to   use   on   his   own .   he   now   plays   primarily   with   the   stuffed   toy .   since   he   s   older   and   rougher   on   them ,   we   purchased   a   few   more   to   ensure   we   had   replacements .   we   are   overall   very   happy   with   the   products   and   the   designs ,   but   one   of   the   ones   we   purchased   was   missing   a   lot   of   the   stuffing   and   was   exceptionally   dirty .   we   ended   up   throwing   it   away .   not   sure   if   this   was   a   one   off   or   if   they   are   randomly   different   weights .
cute ,   practical ,   and   loved   by   little   ones ...   i   ordered   the   cutsie   caterpillar   wubbanub   for   my   daughter   with   hopes   it   would   help   keep   the   soothie   in   her   mouth   for   longer   than   2   seconds   and   it   did ! !   at   6   weeks   old ,   she   was   able   to   wrap   her   arm   around   her   bug ,   which   helped   keep   the   soothie   in   her   mouth .   this   meant   longer   spurts   of   sleeping   for   her   and   me .   she   s   now   5   months   old   and   absolutely   loves   her   bug .   she   s   never   far   from   it   and   can   put   it   in   her   mouth   all   by   herself .   she   d   be   devastated   if   anything   happened   to   it ,   so   just   ordered   another   one   for   back   up .   br   br   at   first   i   was   concerned   about   keeping   the   plush   part   clean   since   it   doesn   t   separate   from   the   soothie ,   but   it   s   a   non   issue .   the   wubbanub   washes   very   easily   in   the   washing   machine   and   air   dries   quickly .   i   just   zip   it   inside   a   boppy   slipcover   before   putting   it   in   the   wash   so   it   doesn   t   get   beat   up   by   the   machine .   br   br   i   highly   recommend   this   for   any   parent   who   is   frustrated   when   their   baby   s   soothie   keeps   falling   out   of   their   mouth .   not   only   did   it   help   our   daughter   keep   it   in   her   mouth ,   it   gave   her   something   to   bond   with   as   she   falls   asleep   or   needs   comfort .
awesome   invention   i   am   a   very   clean   person   and   with   my   husband   and   i   s   first   child   i   wanted   to   make   sure   that   the   baby   s   pacifier   stayed   clean .   this   is   a   great   idea !
lovely   we   love   this   paci !   it   s   not   thick   and   has   a   very   nice   design .   it   s   surely   different   than   the   other   ones   available   on   the   market .   it   s   worth   the   price ,   because   it   doesn   t   suck   the   air   around   his   mouth .   the   only   con   it   has ,   is   it   retains   water   whenever   i   sterlize   it   so   you   need   to   make   sure   to   remove   it   before   you   give   it   back   to   your   lo .
great   for   newborns .   both   of   my   little   ones   loved   these   as   newborns .   i   ve   bought   so   many   of   them   because   i   keep   on   losing   them .   i   give   them   as   shower   gifts .
must   have   i   love   these   pacifiers .   they   are   cute   and   functional .   my   baby   can   put   in   her   mouth .   while   in   the   car ,   if   it   falls   out   of   her   mouth   it   does   not   roll   away   from   her   like   other   pacifiers ,   she   just   pops   it   back   in   her   mouth .   when   she   doesn   t   want   to   suck   on   the   pacifier   part   she   plays   with   the   stuffed   animal .   great   item !
glow   in   the   dark   the   pacifier   is   very   cute   and   just   like   the   others   that   my   lo   loves .   4   stars   because   the   handle   is   glow   in   the   dark ,   which   means   after   being   exposed   to   light   it   will   cause   temporary   glow   but   going   in   his   room   at   2   in   the   morning   looking   for   it   doesn   t   make   it   any   easier   to   find .
she   loves   them   i   don   t   know   why   by   my   daughter   loves   these ,   and   only   these .   i   do   have   to   say   that   compared   to   some   other   pacifiers   these   are   odorless .   quite   a   few   others   we   tried   smelt   like   rubber ,   even   after   boiling .
the   only   pacifier   he   took !   i   tried   going   through   all   of   the   other   pacifiers ,   including   the   soothies .   brought   these   home   to   him   and   he   took   to   them   instantly   and   they   didn   t   seem   to   get   spit   out   easily .   i   love   the   translucence   too   because   you   can   see   more   of   his   face .
my   baby   loves   these   binkies .   my   daughter   will   not   use   any   other   pacifier   than   the   mam   pacifiers .   she   spits   out   the   others   and   screams   until   we   give   her   the   mam   binkie .   i   love   that   they   have   so   many   different   designs .   and   i   think   i   really   should   have   invested   in   mam   stock   as   many   mam   products   as   we   now   have   around   the   house .   i   would   definitely   recommend   these .
my   baby   didnt   like   these   my   baby   will   not ,   under   any   circumstance   use   this   pacifier ,   we   use   the   nuk   pacifier   instead   because   that   is   what   the   hospital   gave   us
not   for   a   newborm   we   got   one   of   these   from   the   hospital .   i   guess   it   explains   the   quality   of   the   product   right   away .....   awful   design ,   horrible   look ,   very   hard   and   ugly   pacifier ,   baby   hates   it   but   take   other   ones .
great   natural   binky !   my   daughter   wasn   t   impressed   at   first ..   i   kept   offering   it   to   her   and   after   about   the   4th   or   5th   time   she   decided   she   liked   it ..   now   she   won   t   take   any   other   kind !
amazing   it   s   sooo   cute   and   my   daughter   loves   it !   it   s   super   soft   and   she   likes   to   hold   on   to   it .   i   would   recommend   this   product   for   anybody   who   has   a   baby !
love   love   love !   our   son   loves   this   thing !   it   really   has   helped   him   grab   on   and   hold   things   better   and   quicker .   he   is   able   to   actually   play   with   it   and   get   it   back   in   his   mouth   at   3   months   old .   esp   like   the   monkey .   it   is   super   soft   and   washes   nicely .   we   have   the   elephant   too ,   but   do   not   prefer   the   material   on   it .
love   the   wubbanub !   i   m   not   a   huge   fan   of   soothie   pacifier   nipples   because   they   don   t   seem   good   for   the   mouth ,   but   a   nurse   i   am   acquainted   with   told   me   about   how   they   are   used   in   the   nicu   so   i   got   the   frog   one   for   my   daughter ...   it   s   so   cute !   she   loved   to   hold   it   while   in   her   bouncer   and   kept   her   company .   now   i   got   the   giraffe   awaiting   my   son   s   arrival ,   i   can   t   wait   to   introduce   it   to   him !  
awesome !   this   is   the   only   pacifier   my   baby   would   use .   he   liked   the   soothie   one   from   the   hospital   big   circle   one   ,   but   these   were   even   better   because   they   had   the   butterfly   shape   and   a   little   hole   in   the   handle   to   attach   a   clip .   the   colors   are   also   very   nice .
good   binkys   we   really   like   these   pacifiers .   we   ve   found   that   these   are   the   only   ones   our   daughter   will   take ,   won   t   even   take   the   soothie   brand   even   though   the   nipple   shape   is   the   same .   we   ve   been   getting   good   use   out   of   them   so   far .   i   ve   found   that   boiling   them   does   change   the   color   a   little   makes   them   a   tad   lighter ,   but   it   doesn   t   have   any   effect   on   their   performance   and   structure .
my   baby   can   t   put   it   down   i   have   yet   to   find   a   pacifier   that   my   baby   doesn   t   get   board   with .   it   s   light   weight   and   if   it   s   not   in   her   mouth   then   it   s   right   by   her   side .   my   4   month   old   loves   it .
like   up   to   now ,   we   had   used   the   mam   air   series ,   and   loved   them .   as   the   perfect   series   is   supposed   to   be   better   for   the   teeth ,   i   got   one   which   our   little   one   accepted   without   any   issue   as   opposed   to   e . g .   some   avent   paci   we   had   tried   .   i   would   give   the   perfect   5   stars   had   they   the   same   exterior   desig   as   the   air   ,   which   was   very   good   for   the   skin   of   our   little   one   so   only   4   stars .   in   case   you   want   to   get   several   of   them ,   check   other   online   vendors   i   just   found   one   offering   them   for   6.99   excl .   shipping   .
best   pacifier   ever   my   first   born   used   these   and   we   loved   them .   one   solid   piece   that   you   don   t   need   to   worry   about   breaking   apart .   we   tried   the   round   pacifier   similar   to   this ,   but   it   was   not   good .   it   was   heavy   and   would   fall   out   of   his   mouth   when   he   was   about   to   sleep ,   waking   him   up .   the   gum   drop   pacifier   fit   his   face   and   is   light   weight .   they   even   make   a   vanilla   flavored   one .   love   gum   drop   pacifiers .
my   baby   likes   another   style   of   pacifier   i   bought   these   after   seeing   that   my   newborn   kept   spitting   out   her   pacifier   that   is   shaped   like   a   bulb   because   my   sister   in   law   used   it   with   her   kid   and   it   works   like   magic   but   unfortunately   my   baby   was   used   to   the   other   paci   even   though   she   kept   spitting   it   out   and   when   i   kept   giving   her   this   one   she   would   just   look   up   at   me   and   scrunch   her   face .   otherwise   it   came   just   like   described .
awesome   case   for   those   indispensable   pacis !   bought   these   to   tote   along   our   son   s   nuk   pacifiers .   we   can   fit   this   on   the   skinniest   part   of   the   chicco   carseat   handle   so   it   s   always   there   when   baby   boy   gets   fussy   and   wants   his   paci .   this   container   has   holes   for   ventilation .   it   easily   fits   two   or   three   of   the   nuk   pacifiers .   we   ve   been   using   this   container   on   a   daily   basis   for   4   months   and   its   held   up   very   well .   being   plastic   its   also   very   easy   to   clean   very   well ,   unlike   those   fabric   paci   holders   that   i   also   considered .   if   your   baby   uses   a   nuk   pacificer ,   you   should   definitely   check   this   case   out .   updated   1   11   12 .   bought   a   2nd   case   to   keep   in   my   car ,   so   that   we   ll   always   have   a   clean ,   safe   way   to   keep   our   baby   s   pacifier   handy .
the   catepillar   is   adorable   and   i   haven   t   been   disappointed   yet   with   wubbanubs !   wubbanubs   are   great   and   i   love   the   mary   meyer   collection !   i   ve   purchased   these   as   gifts   for   several   of   my   friends   and   they   love   them   too !   my   friends   say   that   it   is   easier   to   find   and   harder   to   lose   and   they   have   had   no   safety   concerns   with   the   pacifier .   it   s   a   great   gift !
the   elephant   is   adorable   and   i   haven   t   been   disappointed   yet   with   wubbanubs !   wubbanubs   are   great   and   i   love   the   mary   meyer   collection !   i   ve   purchased   these   as   gifts   for   several   of   my   friends   and   they   love   them   too !   my   friends   say   that   it   is   easier   to   find   and   harder   to   lose   and   they   have   had   no   safety   concerns   with   the   pacifier .   it   s   a   great   gift !
love   these !   the   only   pacifier   my   baby   girl   will   take !   i   live   on   a   base   overseas   and   these   pacifiers   are   so   hard   to   come   by   and   sell   out   quickly   where   i   am .   i   had   to   resort   to   ordering   online   cause   they   never   have   them !   great   quality   and   no   plastic   pieces !   these   are   the   only   pacifiers   i   will   ever   buy .
stay   s   put !   we   tried   3   other   brands   of   pacifiers   and   our   son   seemed   to   be   able   to   keep   dr .   browns   in   his   mouth   much   easier   than   any   other .   it   also   seemed   to   pacify   him   faster   better   perhaps   because   he   wasn   t   frustrated   with   trying   to   keep   it   in .
food   grade   and   safe   when   you   re   on   the   go   you   ll   realize   how   great   these   wipes   are .   they   re   food   grade   and   safe .   i   used   to   think   you   could   use   baby   wipes   to   wipe   down   a   pacifier   or   toy ,   but   then   you   learn   that   the   chemicals   in   the   baby   wipes   aren   t   food   grade .   that   scares   me   as   a   new   mom .   i   m   not   super   cautious   or   protective   and   i   m   not   a   helicopter   mom ,   but   when   something   is   going   directly   into   my   son   s   mouth ,   i   think   important   to   at   least   take   this   small   precaution   and   buy   something   that   s   safe .   totally   worth   it .
hilarious   the   laughs   you   get   with   your   baby   sucking   on   this   in   public   is   hilarious !   i   have   been   stopped   many   times   and   told   that   we   have   made   someone   s   day   from   the   laughs   they   get   from   seeing   my   baby   chewing   on   this .   it   s   halarious !   not   to   mention   it   s   just   a   regular   pacifer   and   my   child   enjoys   it   for   that   aspect   as   well .
best   pacifier   with   my   first   son   i   used   regular   pacifiers .   with   my   second ,   i   found   wubbanub   and   i   have   bought   at   least   5   so   far ,   as   once   in   a   while   we   loose   one .   i   love   wubbanub   as   my   baby   can   find   it   in   his   crib   at   night   much   easier ,   he   loves   it   also   as   a   favorite   teddy   bear ,   and   because   the   wubbanub   is   heavier   it   is   harder   to   walk   around   the   house   with   it ,   decreasing   the   chances   of   addiction   to   having   a   pacifier   all   the   time   in   the   mouth .   my   baby   uses   mostly   to   go   to   sleep ,   in   the   car   or   in   the   stroller .   and   i   think   that   it   will   be   much   easier   to   break   the   habit   in   the   future .   maybe   i   will   just   cut   off   the   pacifier   and   he   can   keep   the   bear ,   giving   him   something   to   hold   to .
kind   of   small   such   a   cute   little   bear ,   and   i   love   that   you   can   throw   it   in   the   wash !   i   wish   the   bear   was   a   little   bigger   tho   my   3   month   old   son   can   t   really   utilize   it   yet .
very   nice   design   we   bought   this   for   our   daughters   baby   shower .   her   husband   is   a   big   fan   and   we   know   they   will   love   it .   we   re   skeptical   about   letting   the   baby   use   it   due   to   the   reports   we   have   read   about   the   paint   running   when   it   gets   wet .
great !   this   was   exactly   what   i   was   looking   for   when   i   was   looking   for   a   pacifier   holder .   i   also   like   that   it   clips   on   to   the   outside   of   bags ,   so   it   s   easy   to   access   when   you   have   a   screaming   baby .   also   fits   2   binks !
the   best   pacifier ,   especially   for   nighttime   we   ve   tried   a   number   of   pacifiers ,   and   these   are ,   by   far ,   the   best .   we   really   like   that   they   glow   in   the   dark ,   and   thus   can   be   easily   found   in   the   middle   of   the   night .
not   feeling   it   i   got   these   for   my   ebf   baby   to   try   to   avoid   nipple   confusion .   they   look   cute   and   i   liked   that   they   are   easy   to   clean   no   trapped   water   in   the   nipple   but   he   just   got   this   confused   look   on   his   face   when   i   gave   it   to   him   and   spit   it   out .   i   think   the   nipple   is   too   square .   we   ended   up   with   the   big   green   soothies   like   everyone   has   and   he   loves   them .   no   problems   with   confusion
pleased   my   son   wouldn   t   take   any   pacifier   until   i   tried   the   wubbanub .   it   definitely   soothes   him   to   the   point   he   falls   asleep .
so   cute   my   son   is   loving   his   new   friend .   he   is   only   4   months   right   now   but   i   know   he   will   continue   to   enjoy   it   for   months   to   come .
love   a   wubbanub   my   son   loves   his   wubbanub .   it   helps   keep   the   pacifier   in   their   mouth   when   they   are   nb   and   when   they   get   older   its   easier   for   them   to   find   and   put   in   their   mouth !
brilliant   healthy   before   coming   across   this   pacifier ,   we   had   tried   3   different   kinds   of   pacifiers   and   neither   one   of   our   2   babies   liked   them .   finally   natursutten   saved   us ...  
great   for   paci   babies   our   first   3   kids   didn   t   like   pacifiers ,   but   our   new   little   one   loves   them !   especially   this   one .   we   adopted   her   and   the   cradle   care   family   sent   her   to   our   home   with   this   little   giraffe ,   and   it   s   been   a   great   soother   for   our   little   one   at   night .   i   tried   using   a   different   pacifier   and   stayed   awake   for   a   very   long   time   putting   it   back   in   her   mouth .   with   the   wubbanub   she   puts   it   back   in   her   mouth .. even   at   2   weeks   old .   we   also   like   that   the   part   that   goes   in   babies   mouth   stayes   off   surfaces   tables ,   etc   when   you   put   it   down .   we   find   it   easier   to   just   hand   wash   and   let   air   dry ,   especially   since   right   now   we   only   have   one .   definatly   a   great   baby   shower   gift .
serves   its   purpose   well   i   ordered   the   elephant   wubbanub   first .   i   loved   it   and   so   did   my   daughter .   she   was   about   6   weeks   old   when   i   got   it ,   and   it   really   helped   her   keep   the   paci   in   her   mouth .   it   would   rest   on   her   belly   and   give   that   extra   support   to   keep   it   there .   unfortunately ,   my   dog   chewed   it   up .   i   loved   the   product   so   much   that   i   immediately   came   on   here   to   order   a   new   one .   the   elephant   was   gone ,   so   i   chose   the   caterpillar .   great   choice !   i   think   it   helps   keep   the   paci   in   her   mouth   even   better   than   the   elephant .   my   daughter   is   now   almost   8   weeks   old ,   and   she   even   looks   like   she   is   physically   holding   the   caterpillar   when   she   uses   it .   it   will   fall   out   of   her   mouth   but   stay   close   enough   that   she   can   root   around   and   get   it   back   in   there   quite   often .   plus ,   it   is   adorable !   i   only   wish   it   were   removeable   so   that   it   could   be   better   washed   and   she   would   be   able   to   keep   the   toy   once   she   no   longer   needs   the   paci   or   i   could   replace   the   paci   if ,   oh ,   my   dog   chewed   that   part   up   or   something .
a   sure   thing   this   is   the   same   pacifier   my   son   used   in   the   hospital   and   has   used   ever   since .   i   love   them   and   they   re   easy   to   sanitize .   a   must   have   for   all   babies
giving   up   on   this   monitor   have   been   through   2   of   these   monitors   now .   the   first   one   worked   well   for   9   months   and   then   just   quit .   note   we   lived   in   a   rural   area   then   so   it   may   be   why   it   worked   well   for   as   long   as   it   did   .   the   second   we   got   did   not   work   straight   out   of   the   box .   we   had   no   picture   and   it   would   not   hold   a   charge .   will   not   be   getting   another   video   monitor .
love   the   lanolin   the   lanolin   really   does   come   off   onto   your   nips   and   helps   with   soreness .   they   are   worth   more   than   the   regular   ones .
pac   n   play   sheets   and   mattress   pad   the   sheets   and   mattress   pad   work   very   well .   they   should   fit   any   standard   size   pack   and   play .   the   only   problem   is   you   have   to   disengage   the   mattress   from   the   frame   to   use   the   mattress   pad   and   sheet .   would   have   been   better   if   they   put   button   holes   where   the   velcro   straps   are   to   keep   the   mattress   flat   in   the   bottom   of   the   pnp .
great   for   smaller   infants   and   preemies   my   daughter   was   less   than   5   pounds   when   she   came   home   from   the   hospital   and   this   swaddle   wrap   was   the   one   that   fit   her   best .   it   is   very   easy   to   get   baby   in   and   out   of   this   wrap   and   it   was   much   more   difficult   for   her   to   free   her   arm   from   this   wrap   versus   the   halo   sleepsack .   she   is   now   8   lbs   and   the   wrap   is   a   little   tight   on   her   already .   there   is   no   way   this   swaddle   would   fit   a   bigger   infant   i   would   recommend   getting   a   bigger   size   if   your   baby   is   7.5   8   lbs   or   more .
so   cute !   these   little   guys   are   so   adorable   and   much   larger   then   i   imagined .   i   can   t   wait   to   hang   them   in   my   sons   nursery .   perfect   touch   to   his   sports   theme .   love   them !
good   value   easy   instructions ,   stroller   is   light   weight ,   practical   and   durable .   i   purchased   this   stroller   as   an   extra   to   keep   at   grandpa   s   when   baby   visits ,   so   as   not   to   have   to   bring   a   stroller   on   the   plane .   we   like   this   one   even   better   than   the   more   expensive   stroller   at   home .   it   was   shipped   quickly   and   arrived   even   earlier   than   promised .   very   satisfied   with   this   purchase .
our   music   box   came   broken   none   available .
love   these !   no   leaks   and   so   soft ,   wash   up   great .   these   are   wonderful .   i   have   the   bamboo   ones .   i   had   given   up   on   reusable   nursing   pads   after   trying   two   other   brands   that   didn   t   work   well .   luckily   i   decided   to   try   these ,   because   i   love   them .   they   are   really   soft   and   there   s   no   lint   sticking   to   my   nipples .   they   are   absorbent   and   have   a   breathable   nearly   waterproof   backing   so   your   bra   doesn   t   get   wet   but   your   boobs   don   t   feel   hot   and   clammy .   i   don   t   think   it   would   be   completely   waterproof ,   but   so   far   i   ve   been   dry .   i   use   it   to   catch   the   letdown   on   the   other   side   when   i   m   nursing   and   can   use   the   same   one   all   day .   they   don   t   bunch   up   in   the   wash   like   the   other   one   i   tried ,   so   it   sits   nice   in   my   bra   and   is   not   noticeable   under   clothing   within   limits   you   would   see   them   if   you   were   really   looking ,   or   wearing   an   unlined   nursing   bra   and   a   tight   fitting ,   light   colored   t   shirt   .   overall   i   m   really   happy   with   these .   i   use   their   cloth   diapers   too   and   love   all   their   products .
fun   to   use   and   it   works !   for   the   past   month   i   ve   been   torturing   my   five   month   old   with   the   hospital   s   nasal   aspirator .   not   only   does   her   crying   probably   just   worsen   the   situation ,   but   the   last   time   i   used   it   i   made   her   bleed .   after   that ,   i   decided   there   had   to   be   a   better   way .   then   a   friend   told   me   about   the   nasalfrida .   what   a   great   product .   first   of   all ,   the   name   itself   is   awesome .   i   simply   refer   to   it   as   the   snotsucker .   second ,   it   works .   for   the   past   two   nights   my   daughter   has   actually   been   able   to   breathe   as   i   nursed   her   to   bed .   finally ,   it   s   so   much   fun   to   use .   the   first   time   i   did   it   my   daughter   cried   because   i   think   she   was   still   traumatized   by   the   regular   aspriator ,   but   tonight   there   was   no   fight   and   even   a   giggle   at   the   end !   a   giggle ! !
great   teething   paci   i   had   purchased   some   mam   paci   s   for   my   son   and   within   2   weeks ,   he   had   holes   in   both   of   them   at   the   base .   when   i   contacted   mam ,   they   said   i   needed   to   use   the   diamond   paci   s   which   were   designed   for   teethers .   i   had   a   hard   time   finding   them   in   stores   and   was   thrilled   when   i   found   them   on   amazon .   the   only   negative   is   you   can   t   choose   the   color .
great   bag   the   bag   is   perfect   for   my   son   s   stuffs ... diapers ,   small   toys ,   milk ,   small   food   and   few   clothes .   the   bag   is   very   spacious   and   very   convenient   to   take   anywhere   we   go .
very   nice   crib   for   the   price   i   just   purchased   this   crib   and   am   very   happy   so   far .   it   looks   really   nice   and   while   it   s   not   quite   the   quality   of   a   pale   crib ... it   s   far   more   economical   and   just   to   look   at   it   you   d   never   know   the   difference .   i   m   looking   forward   to   putting   it   to   use   in   the   next   3   weeks !
very   well   made   this   cover   is   very   sturdy   and   painted   well .   i   was   worried   it   would   not   look   exactly   like   the   picture   but   it   does   and   looks   great   in   my   sons   nursery !   it   will   make   you   want   to   buy   the   whole   kids   line   sports   decor  
you   get   what   you   pay   for   very   cheaply   made .   difficult   to   close .   not   as   lightweight   as   you   would   think .   overall   not   much   different   than   the   20   30   ones   you   could   buy   at   the   store .
ok   toy   i   bought   this   for   my   4   month   old ,   she   doesn   t   have   much   interest   in   it .   and   it   is   very   hard ,   so   since   everything   goes   in   her   mouth   this   did   too .   she   acted   as   if   it   hurt   her   when   she   bit   down   on   it .
awesome ,   wish   i   had   thought   of   it .   i   love   the   sippigrip .   it   keeps   the   sippy   cups   and   toys   off   the   floor   and   in   the   stroller .   perfect   for   my   1   year   old   twins !
great   product !   we   did   our   homework   on   the   best   child   safety   products   before   we   bought   these   magnets   and   found   all   kinds   of   positive   reviews   from   other   parents .   these   magnets   were   easy   to   install   without   having   to   drill   into   our   cabinetry   and   work   really   well .   we   are   very   pleased !

her   own   remote !   our   six   month   old   is   always   trying   to   get   at   our   remotes .   we   finally   got   her   this   one   and   it   has   become   her   new   favorite   toy .   lots   of   sounds   and   lights !   hours   of   entertainment .
excellent   for   my   teething   9   month   old   and   beyond !   this   is   one   of   the   best   purchases   i   have   made !   it   allows   me   to   wear   necklaces   while   toting   my   daughter   around .   it   distracts   her   from   the   real   jewelry   and   she   s   content   chewing   on   the   ring .   i   would   never   have   thought   it   would   work   but   it   did .   highly   recommend   this   item !
very   impressive   sound ,   just   needs   a   2nd   handset   with   my   first   baby   8   years   ago ,   i   found   the   only   use   for   a   monitor   was   during   the   day ,   when   i   m   on   the   go   so   that   i   could   listen   for   the   end   of   a   nap   since   at   night   all   the   crackling ,   and   meaningless   baby   stirings   only   served   to   give   me   a   terrible   nights   sleep .   when   she   was   really   awake   or   needed   attention ,   i   woke   plenty   fast   .   and   although   most   baby   gear   had   been   long   since   been   purged   out   of   my   basement ,   i   still   had   my   basic   sound   monitor   from   all   of   those   years   ago .   and   at   first   the   baby   was   in   a   bassinet   next   to   me ,   and   then   knowing   how   terrible   the   sound   from   my   old   monitor   was   i   didn   t   even   hook   it   up !   but   i   really   did   want   a   day   time   monitor .   so   something   possessed   me   to   spring   for   this   one   and   wow !   i   am   impressed .   the   sound   quality   is   excellent   and   no   crackling   and   it   goes   into   a   sound   passive   mode   when   all   is   quiet   up   there .   and   the   temperature   monitor   is   a   nice   extra   although   not   high   utility   for   me   we   have   central   air   and   great   heat   so   not   something   i   worry   about   too   much   .   and   heck ,   it   looks   cute   too .   so   the   point   is ,   if   you   re   not   as   easy   going   as   me   or   your   baby   s   room   crib   is   far   enough   away   that   you   want   a   monitor   on   overnight   too   this   is   a   great   choice !   you   might   actually   get   some   sleep .   the   only   thing   i   wished   for   was   to   find   an   offering   with   audio   only   like   this   one ,   with   no   movement   monitor   that   has   two   remote   listening   handsets .   my   husband   and   i   often   do   tag   team   on   the   baby   care   while   each   is   off   doing   things   with   our   big   kids   or   chores   around   the   house   and   yard ,   so   it   really   would   be   best   if   they   had   a   2   handset   offering   like   they   do   with   the   movement   monitor   offering .   they   migtht   make   it ,   but   i   couldn   t   find   it   anywhere .
good   seat   this   seat   isn   t   bad .   a   trick   to   get   the   seat   tight   is   too   thread   the   tag   end   of   the   latch   strap   up   under   the   armrest   and   threw   the   cusion ,   then   pull   on   it   to   tighten .   make   sure   the   recline   is   all   the   way   down   when   tightening   the   strap ,   once   its   as   tight   as   you   can   get   it   try   to   recline   the   seat   as   much   as   you   can   by   pulling   up   on   the   seat .   worked   pretty   good   for   me .   the   only   thing   i   don   t   like   about   this   seat   is   that   even   with   the   seat   reclined   back   as   far   as   it   will   go ,   my   son   s   head   stills   falls   forward   when   he   falls   asleep .   even   though   he   stays   asleep ,   he   doesn   t   look   comfortable .   it   needs   a   way   to   recline   back   more .
nice   pacifier   seems   like   a   very   nice   product .   i   have   been   trying   for   months   to   get   my   son   to   take   a   pacifier ,   but   he   does   not   want   it !   but   i   give   it   5   stars   because   it   seems   very   well   made ,   and   i   like   that   they   come   with   individual   covers .
love   them   i   bought   many   many   different   sippy   cups   for   my   1   year   old   son ,   and   the   sip   and   smile   was   the   only   kind   that   he   did   great   with !   this   item   was   a   much   better   deal   than   at   the   stores .   the   only   issue   was   the   colors   may   vary   i   lucked   out   and   got   a   green   and   yellow   ,   but   it   is   a   50   50 .   great   product !
great   stroller   we   took   this   stroller   on   vacation   to   yosemite   and   san   francisco .   it   s   a   very   basic   stroller   but   the   kids   seem   comfortable   and   i   like   the   5   point   harness .   our   stroller   made   the   trek   down   some   tough   trails   and   performed   beautifully .   it   s   a   great   value   and   i   would   definitely   recommend   this   to   someone   else .
my   son   loves   this   his   nanny   bought   him   his   first   and   he   used   it   so   much   that   i   had   to   find   the   exact   some   one   to   replace   it .   i   bought   two .   great   product .   would   recommend .
my   twin   boys   love   this !   this   was   purchased   for   us   as   a   gift .   i   thought   that   perhaps   our   twin   boys   were   too   young   to   play   with   this   wrong !   they   were   completely   enamored   with   the   moving   lights   from   about   three   weeks   old .   they   re   now   nearly   four   months   old ,   and   they   re   still   entertained .   i   love   the   fact   that   you   can   hang   it   upside   down .   we   have   a   very   basic   play   mat ,   and   we   hang   the   flower   garden   upside   down   from   the   arch   it   s   extremely   secure .   they   are   now   able   to   strike   it   themselves   usually   with   their   feet   to   get   it   to   play   the   tunes .   when   one   strikes   it   and   the   melody   plays ,   the   other   stops   what   he   s   doing   to   watch   the   show   even   from   across   the   room   .   fantastic !   we   ve   even   come   up   with   a   little   dance   for   them ... dorky   yes ,   but   it   makes   them   smile   and   anything   is   worth   those   smiles !   oh ,   and   the   impact   required   to   activate   the   flowers   is   far   more   sensitive   than   i   thought   it   would   have   been .   my   boys   can   lightly   brush   one   of   the   flowers   and   the   chimes   melodies   play .   and   the   multiple   textures   and   colors   keep   them   staring .   love ,   love , love   this   toy !
works   great !   we   purchased   this   gate   to   put   at   the   top   of   our   steps   and   it   works   perfectly .   i   have   found   that   it   does   require   two   hands   to   get   the   bottom   hook   in   and   out ,   but   it   is   no   more   hassle   than   any   other   gate .   unfortunately   it   isn   t   very   attractive   to   look   at ,   but   it   does   the   job   and   keeps   my   son   safe .
previous   one   was   better   this   was   a   replacement   for   my   2   year   old ,   who   after   2   years   chewed   the   end   off   of   his   paci .   the   first   horse   was   more   of   a   beanbag   fill   and   squishy .   this   one   appears   the   same   but   has   a   stiffer   poly   feel .
gotta   love   the   wubbanubs ! ! !   wubbanubs   are   great !   they   stay   in   place   so   much   better   than   your   ordinary   pacifier .   now   you   don   t   have   to   use   one   of   those   horrible   clips   to   hold   the   pacifier   onto   your   child   s   clothes .   the   wubbanubs   are   also   great   for   when   it   s   time   to   lose   the   pacifier   because   the   child   doesn   t   want   to   carry   it   around   so   he   gives   it   up   himself .   i   give   these   an   a   and   wouldn   t   have   a   baby   without   one .   for   those   who   say   they   would   never   give   their   baby   a   pacifier   i   say   i   can   always   take   the   pacifier   away ,   but   you   are   stuck   with   a   child   that   sucks   it   s   thumb ! ! !
disappointed ! ! got   wrong   color   pacifiers   i   ordered   these   pacifiers   for   a   baby   boy   and   i   ended   up   getting   pink   color   pacifiers .   i   was   really   disappointed   when   i   opened   the   package .   there   is   no   way   i   can   use   this   pacifiers .   i   really   wish   there   was   an   option   to   choose   color .   as   it   is   a   complete   waste   of   money   to   buy   a   product   which   i   m   never   gonna   use .
binkibear   is   the   best   !   we   got   this   bear   for   our   daughter   when   she   was   just   born   and   it   has   been   her   favorite   since   !   along   the   way   we   got   her   a   second   one   just   because   hers   needed   a   wash   and   she   wont   be   without   it   for   that   long   !   great   product   great   price   and   so   cute   !   also   it   was   always   easy   for   her   to   put   the   binky   in   her   mouth   at   night   !   shipped   fast   !
cute ,   but   far   from   perfect   as   a   mother   of   twins ,   i   look   for   things   to   make   my   life   easier   and   keep   the   boys   happy .   i   purchased   the   mango   monkey   and   mvp   bear .   both   were   sent   by   different   vendors   and   one   got   here   a   day   later   than   the   other   by   parcel   post .   both   took   way   too   long   to   get   here .   my   boys   are   almost   four   months   old   and   cannot   keep   them   in .   they   like   to   hold   them ,   but   they   end   up   pulling   them   out   every   time .   the   monkey   already   has   a   tear   and   my   son   has   had   it   for   only   two   weeks .   they   are   cute   and   my   boys   do   like   them ,   but   it   is   not   fun   having   to   put   them   back   in   their   mouths   every   few   minutes .
my   daughter   loves   these !   this   is   the   only   kind   of   pacifier   my   daughter   will   take .   we   offered   her   a   pacifier   very   early   on   she   was   only   a   couple   weeks   old   ,   and   this   was   the   only   kind   she   would   use .   i   love   the   different   designs   they   have   and   the   fact   that   it   is   an   orthodontic   nipple .   someone   gave   us   a   pacifier   clip   of   another   brand ,   but   it   still   fit   because   the   rubber   ring   fits   easily   around   the   nob .   i   strongly   recommend   a   clip   to   go   with   it   to   keep   one   attached   to   the   car   seat .   now   that   she   is   a   little   older ,   my   daughter   still   uses   these   little   ones ,   but   she   also   has   the   mam   teether   pacifiers   and   loves   them .   now ,   i   always   get   these   as   a   gift   for   my   friends   having   a   baby  
not   a   good   pacifier .   this   seems   like   such   a   good   idea ,   but   my   daughter   hated   these   pacifiers .   they   were   always   snapping   shut   on   her ,   and   the   closures   seemed   to   press   into   her   face   and   not   be   comfortable .   i   offered   them   over   and   over ,   but   finally   gave   up .   i   found   one   in   the   car   months   later   that   i   d   left   there   for   an   emergency ,   and   i   offered   it   again ,   but   she   still   couldn   t   keep   it   in   her   mouth .
good   idea   but   baby   don   t   like   i   bought   this   for   my   newborn .   as   a   first   time   mom ,   i   wanted   to   make   sure   that   everything   that   baby   touches   is   germ   free .   i   ve   used   this   wipe   on   several   occassion   to   quick   clean   her   pacifiers   after   its   been   sitting   out   for   several   days .   when   i   try   to   give   her   the   paci   after   the   cleaning ,   she   spits   it   back   out   and   gives   me   a   disgusting   taste   face .   apparently   baby   isn   t   a   fan   of   the   after   taste   these   wipes   leave   behind .   i   ll   still   keep   these   to   clean   her   plastic   toys ,   but   won   t   be   buying   anymore .
worth   having   a   few   around   i   was   sick   of   fumbling   around   in   the   middle   of   the   night   for   my   daughter   s   paci .   this   solved   the   problem .   even   if   they   hadn   t   been   in   any   light ,   they   were   still   visible   hours   after   i   put   her   to   bed .   they   also   helped   her   learn   to   put   her   own   paci   back   in .   i   would   highly   recommend   getting   a   few   of   these !
wubbanub   the   pacifiers   are   very   similar   to   the   avent   soothie .   i   bought   the   puppy   one .   i   like   this   product   because   in   the   middle   of   the   night   when   my   baby   is   crying ,   i   can   easily   find   the   pacifier   because   it   s   attached   to   the   puppy .   it   helps   a   lot   from   the   pacifier   dropping   out   of   my   baby   s   mouth .   i   wish   it   was   detachable   from   the   puppy   so   i   can   clean   it   easier .
love   it .   i   love   these .   they   re   all   i   use   for   my   binki   addicted   baby .   she   can   even   hold   onto   the   bear   and   is   figuring   out   how   to   put   it   in   her   mouth .   they   re   great   for   car   trips   because   you   can   put   the   arms   through   the   straps   to   hold   the   binki   in   which   makes   car   rides   that   much   easier !
amazing   paci !   our   baby   is   35   weeks   corrected   he   was   born   premature   at   31   weeks   and   he   has   been   using   this   for   over   a   week   since   he   came   home   from   the   nicu   and   the   binki   that   comes   attached   is   just   like   the   soothie   binkis   they   use   in   the   hospital   so   he   took   to   it   right   away !   we   love   it .   he   s   able   to   hold   it   all   by   him   self   and   he   s   only   5lbs   still !   i   would   soo   recomend   this   paci   for   any   baby !   and   the   extra   paci   s   are   super   cheap !   we   bought   it   straight   from   pacimals . com   and   only   spent   28   after   shipping   and   taxes   and   got   toutou   the   dog   plus   3   paci   s   that   attach   right   on .   i   wouldn   t   recomend   using   the   adaptor   and   other   paci   brands   i   would   just   stick   with   the   kind   that   were   made   for   it .   i   included   a   photo   of   my   little   man   in   the   pictures   at   the   top   with   mr .   toutou .
must   have   i   bought   this   and   2   other   wubbanubs .   it   s   all   i   use   and   they   re   absolutely   fantastic .   they   wash   easily   and   hold   up   really   well .
best   paci   ever !   we   were   given   this   pacifier   in   the   hospital ,   and   we   love   it !   our   daughter   has   no   trouble   keeping   it   in   her   mouth ,   her   nose   isn   t   blocked ,   it   s   easy   to   clean ,   the   grasp   piece   on   the   outside   is   great   for   handling   the   paci   without   having   to   touch   the   mouth   piece ,   and   the   opening   on   the   other   side   of   the   nipple   is   great   for   putting   your   finger   in   for   extra   gumming   chewing   substance   sometimes   they   just   need   a   little   more   to   latch   on   to   than   just   the   plastic   .   we   have   had   no   trouble   finding   paci   holders   that   are   compatible   with   this   paci   there   s   a   hole   on   the   grasp   piece   for   threading   a   holder   thread   through   .   i   m   ordering   a   couple   more   so   we   can   have   one   paci   in   her   crib ,   one   with   the   papasan   and   one   for   the   car   seat   with   an   extra   one   or   two   just   in   case !   .   wish   i   had   had   these   when   our   son   was   a   baby !
yarr ! !   pirate   stuff   is   awesome   no   matter   what ,   when   i   saw   this   i   really   wanted   one   for   my   newborn   son ,   and   ordered   it   right   away ,   then   when   it   arrived   i   was   surprised   how   big   the   skull   was   on   the   other   side   and   relized   that   he   would   need   to   be   6   months   before   he   could   hold   the   weight   of   this   thing ! !   either   way   i   thought   it   was   still   adorable   and   can   t   wait   to   use   it .
not   good   quality   the   color   and   style   is   nice   but   not   the   overall   design .   the   package   said   orthodontic .   these   pacifiers   are   not   the   traditional   orthodontic   ones .   baby   doesn   t   like   this   binky ,   neither   do   i .   i   m   also   noticing   the   gray   part   of   the   soother   is   scratched   up   as   well .
too   unnatural   for   my   breast   obsessed   baby   my   5   week   old   does   not   like   any   pacifiers ,   and   he   does   not   like   these   either .   i   think   that   the   shape   and   feel   of   the   plastic   is   too   different   from   what   he   prefers   most   the   breast .   he   seems   to   have   trouble   forming   suction   in   the   way   that   you   do   while   breast   feeding .   like   most   traditional   pacifiers ,   there   is   a   ninety   degree   angle   perpendicular   junction   between   the   hard   plastic   outside   shell   and   inner   soft   plastic   piece   that   goes   in   the   mouth .   this   composition   makes   it   difficult   for   him   to   latch   on   as   it   is   so   different   from   how   one   latches   onto   the   breast .   anyway ,   i   suspect   that   if   your   baby   generally   likes   pacifiers ,   they   will   probably   like   these .   but   if   they   are   choosy   and   or   exclusively   breast   fed ,   they   may   not   like   these .   therefore ,   you   may   want   to   think   twice   if   you   re   purchasing   or   registering   for   these   for   a   baby   that   hasn   t   arrived   yet ,   or   until   you   have   a   better   sense   of   their   preferences .
love   it !   my   son   will   only   take   a   pacifier   like   the   one   given   at   the   hospital .   i   was   so   excited   to   see   this   toy   pacifier .   he   s   now   3   months   and   loves   this !   he   can   move   his   pacifier   to   his   mouth   himself ,   something   he   could   not   yet   do   w   o   the   attached   toy .   as   a   bonus ,   the   puppy   is   too   cute !
how   do   you   clean   this   thing   let   me   start   off   by   saying ,   i   love   this   pacifier !   my   daughter   has   the   yellow   duck   and   the   red   dog .   my   problem   is   that   both   are   made   of   fleece   material .   i   am   a   very   clean   parent ,   but   the   fleece   material   has   attracted   all   sorts   of   dirt   and   lint   that   simply   will   not   come   off .   i   want   to   purchase   two   more ,   so   are   there   any   more   of   these   out   there   that   are   not   fleece   material  
my   grandson   loves   them   there   is   something   about   these   pacifiers   that   seem   similar   to   the   old   playtex   pacifiers   that   i   used   for   my   daughters .   when   my   daughter   had   my   grandson ,   they   were   the   only   one   he   would   take .   they   used   to   be   carried   by   babies   r   us ,   but   for   some   reason   they   stopped   carrying   them ,   which   led   to   a   massive   web   search   and   alas ,   we   found   them   on   amazon .
glow   in   the   dark   was   suprise   because   wehn   i   turn   off   the   light   the   holder   was   glowing . its   nice   cos   in   the   middle   of   the   night   dont   need   to   actually   get   up   and   find   where   is   the   pacifier   went .   will   recommend   it
lovin   it   bought   it   early   for   my   son   to   get   used   to   it   by   halloween .   hes   not   really   a   pacifier   user   and   started   chewing   the   teeth   and   handle   first .   today   he   just   discovered   the   teat   nipple .   so   far   so   good .   since   i   think   its   main   purpose   is   for   the   onlookers   to   be   pleased   and   to   just   have   fun   with   it ,   mommy   s   very   pleased .
so   cute !   i   bought   these   for   my   new   nephew   and   his   mom   and   dad   really   liked   them !   i   didn   t   use   them   personally   but   they   make   a   great   gift   of   super   fans !
the   best   out   there ! ! ! ! !   wubba   nubs   are   the   real   deal .   we   have   ordered   8   10   of   these   from   amazon .   our   babies   have   loved   them   and   cherished   them .   they   don   t   fall   out   and   bounce   and   they   can   hold   on   to   them .   love   the   wubbas ! !
comes   unsnapped   i   bought   this   because   i   like   skip   hop   and   my   jj   cole   s   velcro   was   coming   off   of   my   other   pacy   holder .   it   was   such   a   disappointment .   the   zippered   holder   works   great   but   if   you   want   to   hang   it   on   your   diaper   bag   forget   it !   after   about   2   3   weeks   of   using   it   you   will   be   in   a   store   with   a   screaming   child   and   you   look   to   where   the   pacy   holder   should   be   just   to   find   it   not   there   because   it   fell   off   on   the   way   to   the   car .   but   if   you   are   just   going   to   shove   it   in   your   bag   then   i   would   choose   this   one   over   the   rest ,   but   if   you   want   an   easily   accessible   one   to   attach   to   your   bag   s   straps   choose   another   one .
super   cute   i   bought   these   for   a   friend   at   her   babyshower ,   when   she   had   the   baby   these   were   the   only   pacifiers   she   used   during   cardinals   season .   super   cute   and   she   loved   them   so   it   made   the   ridiculious   price   worth   wild .   because   10.00   is   really   too   much   for   these .
our   daughter   s   favorite   these   were   the   only   paci   s   our   daughter   who   is   now   15   months   would   take .   they   come   in   fun ,   bright   colors ,   which   is   great   because   that   makes   them   easier   to   find   at   the   bottom   of   the   diaper   bag !
i   like   the   cap !   i   like   that   this   pacifier   has   its   own   cap   for   it   so   that   it   s   easy   to   keep   clean   when   rolling   around   in   the   diaper   bag .   my   son   isn   t   a   huge   fan   of   pacifiers   in   general ,   but   he   s   taken   to   this   one   more   than   others .
great   purchase   love   this   and   would   recommend   to   any   new   parent   to   get   for   their   little   one .   it   s   perfect   for   traveling .   we   leave   it   our   son   s   carseat   for   any   trip ..   easy   for   him   to   hold   onto ,   pick   up   if   he   drops ,   and   doubles   as   a   play   toy !   my   only   negative   would   be   the   price ..   you   can   get   the   same   thing   for   about   half   the   cost ,   but   i   really   liked   the   dragon ..
baby   s   favorite   pacifiers   good   size ,   not   clunky ,   easy   to   find   when   dropped   because   of   colored   white   front ,   baby   prefers   this   shape   over   others .   but   of   course   every   baby   is   different   so ...   yours   may   hate   this   one !
the   lamprey   effect   when   my   little   one   was   discharged   from   her   stay   in   the   nicu ,   the   nicu   nurses   threw   together   a   bag   for   us   with   all   kinds   of   stuff   from   their   shelves .   included   was   about   30   of   these .   i   think   i   m   good   to   go   on   pacifiers   for   the   rest   of   her   infanthood .   br   br   these   little   guys   are   great !   we   got   several   other   brands   of   pacifiers   at   our   baby   shower ,   and   my   daughter   rejects   anything   but   these .   she   s   not   a   huge   fan   of   pacifiers   in   general ,   and   only   wants   to   take   one   when   she   is   super ,   super   fussy ,   or   crying   while   she   s   waiting   to   eat .   the   soothies   are   big   enough   and   bold   enough   in   color   to   find   in   the   middle   of   the   night   in   the   crib ,   too ,   which   is   an   extra   bonus .   they   re   also   really   easy   to   keep   clean .   i   throw   mine   in   the   dishwasher .   you   can   also   stick   your   pinky   finger   in   the   little   hole   on   the   nipple   part ,   and   that   really   seems   to   be   something   my   daughter   likes   a   lot .   br   br   with   all   that   said ,   the   best   part   of   all   isn   t   advertised .   these   pacifiers   are   translucent ,   so   when   you   put   it   in   your   baby   s   mouth ,   you   can   see   the   sucking   action .   it   looks   a   bit   like   a   lamprey ,   really .   it   s   absolutely   absurd   and   adorable .   i   never   thought   i   d   find   amusement   in   watching   my   kid   suck   on   a   pacifier ,   but   it   s   strangely   fascinating ,   and   my   husband   and   i   both   laugh   at   it   every   time .   she   s   our   little   lamprey .
these   are   good   my   son   just   doesn   t   like   pacifiers ,   but   he   likes   this   one   when   he   s   tired   enough   and   just   needs   something   to   gnaw   on   for   a   minute   while   he   falls   asleep .   i   like   that   s   it   s   one   piece ,   and   it   s   tough   so   i   don   t   have   to   worry   about   him   breaking   it   or   anything .
better   than   others   this   is   the   only   pacifier   my   7   weeks   old   would   keep   for   few   minutes   he   does   not   like   pacifiers   a   lot   .   i   like   the   fact   that   it   is   made   with   natural   rubber   and   that   it   has   a   round   nipple   much   easier   for   my   little   one   to   hold   on   to   than   the   orthodontic   ones   i   tried  
great !   i   wish   i   thought   of   this !   perfect   for   baby   to   have   something   to   hold ,   esp   in   the   first   months   when   they   get   startled   jump   easily !
great   product !   just   exactly   how   i   imagined   it   would   be .   great   prouct   even   fits   a   couple   bulky   soothie   pacifiers   and   easy   to   access   as   well   as   attach   to   diaper   bag !
sent   pink   for   a   boy   i   know   it   is   partially   my   fault   for   not   reading   all   the   fine   print   but   i   really   didn   t   expect   them   to   send   me   pink   pacifiers .   i   do   like   these   pacifiers   but   will   never   order   them   from   here   again .   they   need   to   have   boy   or   girl   choices   at   least .   i   would   have   been   happy   with   any   color   besides   pink .
great   my   baby   i   love   these   must   have .   kinda   pricy   but   a   nice   product .   my   baby   likes   the   taste   lol   would   buy   again   will   recommend !
the   best   thing   we   ever   bought   we   bought   one   when   my   son   was   2   months   bc   he   couldn   t   keep   his   bink   he   calls   it   his   ning   ning   in   his   mouth   by   himself .   this   was   perfect   to   keep   it   in .   now   he   s   21   months   and   if   he   wakes   up   in   the   middle   of   the   night ,   he   can   find   it   himself   in   the   dark .   he   still   has   that   first   bink ,   along   with   two   more .   he   goes   to   bed   with   all   of   them .   the   only   reason   i   am   giving   it   4   starts   is   bc   the   bink   does   not   detach   from   the   animal ,   so   if   it   has   to   be   replaced   i   have   to   buy   more ,   remove   the   old   one ,   and   sew   the   new   one   on .   it   s   a   pain   bc   i   have   to   do   it   about   twice   a   month .   i   know   it   s   probably   time   to   take   the   binks   away   from   him ,   but   he   loves   them   so   much   i   can   t   do   it   yet .
excellent   product   for   child   care   but   was   not   exactly   what   i   ordered !   i   purchased   this   unit   as   a   present   for   my   sister   and   her   first   baby   in   december   2010   and   she   told   me   that   she   loved   this   monitor   so   much   because   it   made   her   life   so   much   easier   while   being   out   of   direct   view   of   her   daughter .   i   made   my   first   visit   this   week   sept .   2011   to   her   house   since   being   born   and   came   to   discover   that   the   handheld   unit   was   a   black   and   white   screen   instead   of   the   color   video   monitor   as   promised   in   the   add .   i   think   it   works   fine   but   i   definitely   would   enjoy   getting   exactly   what   i   ordered   instead   of   finding   out   9   months   later   that   you   didn   t   get   exactly   what   you   ordered !   this   was   the   only   reason   why   i   didn   t   give   this   a   perfect   score ... my   sister   loved   it   and   that   is   what   was   important   to   me !
love   it ! ! ! ! !   this   thing   is   amazing ! ! ! ! ! ! !   i   bought   this   instead   of   a   high   chair .   and   we   are   soooo   happy   we   did ! !   we   love   it   and   i   would   recommend   it   to   anyone   who   needs   a   booster   high   chair   for   their   baby ! ! !   save   your   money   and   buy   one   of   these ! ! !

wish   i   bought   this   sooner ....   i   bought   this   when   it   was   time   to   take   a   road   trip   with   my   6   month   old .   i   had   been   using   a   small   handheld   in   the   car   for   other   times   we   were   out   needed   to   pump   but   for   long   trips   only   my   symphony   would   cut   it .   love   this .   felt   100   the   same   power   you   get   from   plugging   into   wall .   can   t   live   without
great   product   fits   the   doorway   perfectly ,   looks   great ,   seems   very   stable .   my   dog   is   a   climber ,   but   the   vertical   bars   and   lack   of   footholds   stops   him   from   even   trying .   i   like   that   the   gate   opens   both   ways ,   and   will   close   itself   unless   you   open   it   all   the   way ,   at   which   point   it   stays   open .   perfectly   designed ,   in   my   opinion ,   and   i   m   about   to   order   a   couple   more .
just   ok   i   got   this   stroller   because   i   needed   something   lightweight .   and   yes ,   it   is   lightweight   and   it   s   easy   to   fold   and   to   open .   but   that   s   about   it .   we   live   in   miami   and   the   umbrella   is   completely   useless ,   it   barely   covers   the   sun   and   it   certainly   does   not   cover   rain .   the   steering   is   really   awful ,   you   cannot   do   it   with   one   hand   if   there   s   barely   a   bump   on   the   ground .   the   tires   are   pretty   cheap   and   don   t   handle   much .   overall   it   s   an   ok   stroller ,   but   it   feels   a   bit   on   the   cheap   side ,   which   i   suppose   is   why   it   s   so   light   weight .
love   this !   was   hesitant   to   purchase   because   of   the   price ,   but   it   is   so   adorable   and   much   larger   then   i   expected .   we   are   using   it   as   toy   storage   for   our   infant   and   it   is   perfect !
love   it ! ! !   i   love   this   product .   great   multi   use   bag .   dirty   clothes ,   dirty   diapers ,   swim   suits ,   make   up   bag .   i   m   never   without   this   bag ,   need   to   order   more .   i   would   recommend   this   product   time   and   time   again .
awesome   and   fun   well   worth   the   price .   told   my   children   that   this   is   where   their   stuffed   animals   would   rest   and   be   happy .   it   has   become   a   great   place   for   them   to   lounge   with   their   friends .
much   smaller   then   i   expected   i   have   not   had   the   chance   to   use   this   item   yet   as   our   baby   is   not   due   for   another   two   months .   br   br   i   think   i   will   like   the   hanging   bag   feature   it   has   but   it   is   a   lot   smaller   in   person   then   i   gathered   from   the   photo . it   will   still   do   the   job   and   from   appearances   will   look   to   hold   10   12   diapers   just   wish   it   was   bigger .
great   product !   i   ordered   this   for   my   1.5 yr   old   son   who   would   not   sleep   in   the   pack   n   play   after   numerous   attempts .   the   first   night   we   were   away   from   home   and   i   put   the   mattress   in ,   he   slept   through   the   night .   this   was   a   life   saver   while   we   were   away !   i   would   highly   recomend   it !
excellent ! ! !   on   time   and   the   quality   of   product   is   excellent   and   the   price   is   the   lowest   on   the   market .   i   would   tell   a   friend .   thanks !
improved ! !   ignore   other   reviews !   i   got   this   for   my   22   months   daughter .   she   still   has   times   on   my   ergo ,   but   mostly   it   is   reserved   for   my   5   months   old .   she   loves   dolls   and   copies   everything   i   do .   she   loved   her   own   ergo !   i   was   reading   the   reviews   and   was   ready   to   use   the   strap   from   the   box   to   keep   it   in   place   but   this   was   not   needed   as   her   ergo   came   with   a   back   buckle !   just   like   mine !   it   stays   in   place   and   she   is   happily   taking   her   doll   for   walks   as   her   mommy   takes   her   baby   brother !   we   love   it
effectively   delivers   peace   of   mind   ...   foremost ,   like   most   reviewers   here ,   i   was   astonished   at   the   counter   space   consumed   by   the   avent   sterilizer .   no   matter   how   large   your   kitchen ,   counter   space   always   remains   at   a   premium .   does   one   put   her   his   juicer   into   hibernation   not   if   one   wants   to   stay   energized   and   healthy !   does   one   s   coffee   maker   disappear   into   the   cupboard   not   if   one   cares   to   stay   awake   through   morning   presentations !   one   s   grill   one   needs   to   knock   out   the   fat   !   unlikely ,   indeed !   so ,   with   this   product   comes   a   bit   of   compromise   true   ,   but   most   parents   are   prepared   for   compromise   ...   what   remains   most   important ,   the   avent   sterilizer   does   its   job .   it   is   one   less   thing   to   worry   about   since   it   is   immensely   effective   and   provides   one   s   child   with   one   more   layer   of   protection .   that   s   pretty   priceless   in   my   world .   as   far   as   practicality   is   concerned ,   it   s   far   quicker   than   your   dishwasher   and ,   it   is   just   a   more   specific ,   cleaner   venue   for   such   precious   items   .   one   can   cut   corners   on   a   number   of   baby   products   if   one   needs   to   nonetheless ,   this   is   a   splurge   that   soon   becomes   perceived   as   an   absolute   need .   and ,   as   you   can   imagine ,   this   rings   especially   true   for   first   time   parents !   buy   it   for   your   baby ,   give   it   as   a   gift ,   put   it   on   your   registry   ...   just   get   it .   trust   me ,   its   well   worth   sacrificing   that   cappuccino   machine   that   you   never   use   anyway   !
surprisingly   entertaining   for   babies .. i   have   no   idea   why   i   found   this   through   looking   for   top   registry   items .   i   seriously   wonder   how   a   toy   can   be   a   top   registry   item   when   it   s   simply   a   toy .   anyways ,   i   purchased   it   because   i   was   on   a   spree   looking   for   hanging   toys   for   my   little   one   s   play   gym   mat   and   decided   to   try   this   based   on   the   reviews   .   it   s   actually   not   a   bad   purchase   although   i   wouldnt   say   it   s   the   best   just   yet .   i   love   that   the   tunes   don   t   just   end   after   a   few   seconds .   there   are   about   5   6   tunes   that   aren   t   annoying   in   fact ,   made   one   of   the   most   annoying   tunes   before   sound   pleasing   now   .   there   are   lights   that   flashes   to   the   tune   of   the   songs   which   is   a   plus   cuz   babies   love   looking   at   lights .   it   s   easy   to   take   anywhere   you   go .   and   lastly ,   it   made   my   little   one   smile .   normally   i   get   a   smile   here   and   there .   with   this ,   i   got   possibly   three   smiles   in   a   row .   i   stopped   the   music   to   make   sure   it   was   actually   the   music   making   him   smile ,   then   turned   it   back   on .. and   he   smiled   again .   for   this   reason   alone ,   i   give   this   product   a   4 .   i   would   give   this   product   a   5   if   i   can   get   a   non   stop   giggle   from   my   baby .
best   invention   ever   cannot   say   enough   positive   things   about   this   product !   it   was   a   lifesaver   for   my   daughter   and   my   sanity .   she   had   reflux   and   laying   on   her   back ,   she   would   never   sleep   longer   than   5   minutes   in   the   rock   n   play   she   would   sleep   5   hours   a   night   from   2   3   weeks   old .   i   would   highly   recommend   this   to   anyone   from   birth   to   3   months !   my   daughter   used   this   instead   of   a   crib   until   she   was   almost   4   months   old .
good   bottles   the   bottles   were   fine ,   my   wife   just   wished   they   were   an   inch   or   so   longer   in   length   they   were   a   bit   on   the   short   side .
nice   changer   this   is   such   a   cute   changing   table .   it   wasn   t   terribly   hard   to   assemble   and   seems   very   sturdy .   i   also   bought   the   parker   crib   and   three   drawer   dresser .   i   really   liked   this   changing   table   because   it   offers   shelves   instead   of   drawers   and   the   unit   can   be   re   purposed   after   using   it   as   a   changer .   the   only   drawback   was   that   the   changing   pad   it   came   with   is   very   thin .   i   went   out   and   bought   a   much   plusher   version ,   but   it   fit   into   the   spot   well   and   i   am   very   happy   with   it .   the   wood   does   tend   to   scratch   easily ,   but   for   the   price   i   can   deal   with   some   scratches .
fantastic   parenting   tool   this   is   one   of   the   best   parenting   tools   when   your   child   has   a   cold   and   a   stuffy   nose ,   but   can   t   blow   his   nose   for   himself .   sounds   gross ,   but   it   works   fabulously   and   turns   out   not   to   be   gross   after   all !
suction   cup   toy   this   thing   is   great !   there   are   so   many   ways   it   keeps   your   baby   entertained .   the   wheel   looks   really   cool   when   you   spin   it   fast ,   it   makes   a   fun   noise   seriously ,   the   only   toy   in   my   house   that   makes   noise   that   i   don   t   find   annoying !   ,   there   are   little   bead   like   things   don   t   worry ,   they   re   not   coming   unattached   no   matter   what   ,   it   spins   and   turns ,   i   could   go   on   on .   it   s   so   worth   the   money ,   my   baby   is   9   m   still   gets   a   kick   out   of   it   regularly .
only   thing   going   for   it   is   the   cute   print   i   wanted   an   affordable   shopping   cart   cover   and   this   one   looked   great ,   plus   had   good   reviews   at   the   time   on   the   babies   r   us   website .   well ,   it   is   not   padded   at   all ,   is   a   royal   pain   to   set   up ,   especially   while   holding   a   baby ,   and   does   not   fit   larger   carts ,   such   as   at   target .   continuing   in   its   frustrating   qualities ,   i   do   not   find   it   easy   to   fold   up   into   itself   or   unfold .   the   toy   loops   are   way   too   far   down ,   making   it   tricky   for   my   son   to   access   the   toys   and   keep   the   nasty   cart   handle   covered .   you   see ,   if   i   want   him   to   be   able   to   reach   the   toys   on   the   loops   okay ,   i   have   to   fold   it   toward   him .   when   i   put   him   in   the   full   harness   covering   his   shoulders ,   it   forces   him   to   slouch   down   at   an   uncomfortable ,   and   probably   unsafe   angle ,   so   i   just   use   the   buckle   around   his   waist .   br   br   this   is   a   purchase   i   really   regret .   i   would   suggest   looking   for   a   cover   that   is   padded   and   fits   on   the   cart   with   elastic .   i   m   curious   if   other   shopping   cart   covers   all   have   to   be   buckled   around   the   back   of   the   seat   area   too   in   order   for   the   cover   s   safety   belt   to   work   well ,   or   if   an   elastic   fit   would   keep   it   secure   enough .   yes ,   i   do   like   the   pattern ,   but   the   quality   of   the   fabric   is   borderline   cheap ,   and   overall   it   s   an   annoying   mess .   i   ve   been   using   it   for   several   months   now   and   never   learned   to   like   it !
super   cute !   i   bought   this   cover   because   the   only   other   one   i   had   was   blue   and   i   am   having   a   baby   girl   soon .   it   s   super   cute ,   easy   to   wash   and   it   really   would   work   for   either   a   boy   or   a   girl   because   it   is   more   red .
the   only   bottle   my   infant   will   use !   i   love   these   bottles !   after   trying   all   these   fancy ,   nice   bottles   that   have   all   these   special   features ,   but   my   son   easily   latched   on   to   these   bottles .   they   re   easy   to   clean ,   they   re   the   perfect   flow ,   they   re   great   for   travel   because   they   have   additional   cap   under   the   nipple .   they   re   awesome ! ! ! ! ! ! !
perfect   for   us !   it   is   easy   to   assemble   and   weights   practically   nothing !   we   love   it   and   are   really   happy   we   chose   this   one   instead   of   another   car   travel   system .
fantastic   great   design .   one   of   the   better   kids   accessories   i   have   botten .   i   feel   like   my   money   was   well   spent .   i   have   bought   so   much   junk   that   gets   thrown   away   as   far   as   bottle   and   containers   ect   for   my   kids .   i   still   use   these   and   they   are   sturdy   and   useful .   good   to   use   the   bottle   strap   u   can   get   on   amazon .   hook   it   around   the   handle   and   now   you   can   have   a   container   of   snacks   on   your   stroller   that   wont   spill   when   your   kid   throws   it   on   the   floor .   nice   soft   top   that   dosent   come   off   easy .
only   cute   for   a   kids   room .   looks   cheap .   only   cute   for   a   kids   room .   looks   cheap . i   wouldnt   recommend   this   product   to   a   friend .   my   husband   and   i   didnt   care   for   it .
perfect   for   cleaning   the   straws   of   sippy   cups   i   can   t   live   without   these   things .   we   use   the   sippy   cups   with   straws   this   cleans   them   out   very   well .   nice   and   cheap   durable .   one   pack   lasts   about   6   weeks .   great   product .   so   glad   it   exists .
good   so   far   i   m   using   this   for   co   sleeping .   i   ve   had   it   about   a   week   now   and   so   far   so   good .   my   kid   is   only   six   weeks   old   and   he   doesn   t   move   around   much   yet   so   i   can   t   fully   review   this   product ,   but   so   far   it   s   what   i   expected .   i   think   it   can   be   improved   upon   to   better   suit   the   co   sleeping   clientele   but   it   s   the   best   i   could   find .   br   update   nine   months   later   and   i   like   this   product   even   more .   we   are   still   co   sleeping   bed   sharing   and   this   product   is   indispensable .   we   even   take   it   with   us   when   we   travel   although   we   haven   t   had   to   fly   with   it   yet   .   we   use   a   bungee   cord   to   secure   the   legs   to   the   frame   so   they   don   t   flop   around .   and   when   we   do   fly   we   plan   to   take   it   apart   to   fit   in   a   suitcase .   br   we   ve   used   bed   bumpers   too   and   we   still   do   in   the   center   of   the   bed   to   separate   my   husband   s   space   from   me   and   the   baby   s   space   although   we   don   t   use   the   bumper   we   bought ,   just   a   rolled   up   blanket ,   but   that   s   for   another   review   .   what   i   like   most   is   that   this   product   makes   the   entire   bed   usable ,   while   bed   bumpers   take   up   valuable   inches .   it   s   also   very   sturdy .   what   i   don   t   like   is   that   at   each   end   the   arm   it   s   made   of   hard   plastic   and   isn   t   covered   with   padding   the   way   most   of   the   other   hard   pieces   close   to   the   mattress   are .   i   use   a   small   round   bolster   to   fill   the   space   between   my   mattress   and   night   stand .   i   pull   it   down   to   cover   this   hard   plastic .   there   haven   t   been   any   tears   caused   by   this   yet   but   there   have   been   near   misses   and   i   m   always   looking   out   for   it .   br   overall ,   this   is   one   of   the   best   baby   purchases   we   made   and   i   often   recommend   it   to   other   co   sleeping   families .   i   can   t   imagine   co   sleeping   without   it .
a   must   for   any   baby .   this   product   is   a   must   for   babies .   very   safe ...   i   found   a   amazing   deal   on   amazon .   research   the   vulli   sophie   the   giraffe   teether   if   you   havent   already .
adorable   mobile   i   love   this   mobile   and   so   does   my   baby .   it   was   the   first   item   that   would   get   and   hold   her   attention   when   she   was   a   few   weeks   old .   it   s   so   cute ,   i   decorated   the   whole   nursery   around   it .
not   for   my   active   3   months   old   i   loved   the   idea   of   a   paci   that   wont   fall   out .   when   i   got   the   paci ,   i   loved   the   toy   and   everything .   unfortunately   my   son   didnt   like   the   soothie   brand .   i   went   for   make   it   urself   project   and   sew   his   old   avent   paci   to   the   wubbanub .   but   he   still   didnt   like   it .   he   is   a   very   ative   boy ,   he   waves   his   arms   and   rips   the   paci   out   of   his   mouth .   the   toy   is   good   size   for   his   little   hands   to   play   with   and   im   really   hoping   he   ll   like   it   later ,   when   he   can   reach   for   a   pacifier   and   put   it   in   his   mouth   knowingly ,   not   by   accident .
good   deal !   i   bought   this   for   my   1   year   old   s   nap   time   at   daycare .   i   like   the   padded   mat   part   since   they   have   hard   floors .   i   ve   washed   it   at   least   three   times   and   have   noticed   the   fleece   pilling   but   overall   for   the   price   and   what   he   uses   it   for ,   i   think   i   d   buy   it   again .   my   little   guy   loves   the   tractor   theme  
pacifier   i   am   very   satisfied   with   the   product .   it   is   just   a   shame   that   the   only   place   a   person   could   find   this   product   was   threw   amazon .   it   is   a   very   sturdy   product .   what   more   can   you   say   it   works ,   thank   god .
soothies   the   pacifiers   came   just   in   time   for   my   trip   to   see   my   grandson .   he   absolutely   loves   only   these   types   of   soothies   and   they   work   so   well .   fast   delivery   great   service .
super   silly   this   pacifier   is   super   silly   especially   when   my   little   one   10   months   hams   it   up .   my   baby   usually   gets   attention   she   s   a   people   person   ,   but   i   love   hearing   the   random   giggles   as   we   go   by .   just   a   note   because   i   couldn   t   find   info   on   it   when   i   first   looked   the   shape   of   the   actual   sucking   part   is   more   like   the   playtex   pacifier   style   with   the   upturn   on   the   end   .   we   usually   use   advent   which   has   a   different   style .
hard   to   find   anywhere   else   this   particular   kind   of   pacifier   was   loved   by   my   niece ,   so   i   wanted   to   try   them   and   can   t   find   them   anywhere   but   here .   neither   of   my   kids   ended   up   using   pacifiers ,   but   this   is   a   good   one   and   amazon   is   the   only   place   i   could   find   them .
best   pacifier   this   is   the   pacifier   that   they   gave   my   daughter   at   the   hospital ,   and   she   loves   it .   they   last   forever ,   my   older   daughter   also   used   this   kind ,   and   they   are   fairly   big   so   they   are   easy   to   find   in   the   crib   at   2am .
so   cute !   this   product   was   perfect   and   so   cute !   the   shipping   was   fast   and   the   item   was   as   expected .   very   pleased   with   this   purchase .   it   was   a   gift   and   it   was   very   well   received .
works   for   our   9   month   old   these   nuks   have   been   around   for   ages   and   they   still   work   as   promised .   my   one   complaint   is   that   they   can   become   a   bit   waterlogged   either   water   or   baby   saliva   and   make   some   noise   when   sucked ,   but   if   you   have   3   4   of   them   in   reserve   and   can   rotate ,   then   you   re   fine .
misleading   pic   on   amazon   the   picture   featured   here   is   misleading .   you   get   2   pacifiers ,   not   4 .   amazon   should   really   take   that   image   down .   the   pacifiers   themselves   are   fine .
love   this   wubbie   love   wubba   nubs ,   love   this   elephant   version .   very   soft   and   cute !   we   always   get   compliments   when   out   and   about   with   it .
great   idea ,   poor   execution   i   had   very   high   hopes   for   this   pacifier   when   i   bought   it .   however ,   it   was   made   with   such   poor   quality   material   so   badly   designed   that   it   is   really   a   huge   waste   of   money .   the   plastic   on   the   outside   is   so   brittle ,   that   if   it   falls   on   a   hard   surface ,   such   as   concrete ,   it   is   prone   to   shattering ,   leaving   sharp ,   jagged   edges   that   you   would   never   put   near   your   baby   s   mouth .   also ,   it   doesn   t   take   long   before   the   closure   no   longer   closes   all   the   way ,   defeating   the   purpose .   furthermore ,   the   clip   is   just   as   fragile .   the   handle   that   opens   closes   the   clasp   snaps   off   much   too   easily ,   rendering   the   clip   useless .   i   had   to   replace   both   so   many   times   that   after   6   months ,   i   gave   up   entirely   went   with   another   brand ,   mam .   both   the   pacifier   the   clip   are   made   of   much   sturdier   materials   the   design   of   the   clip   is   such   that   the   moving   parts   are   much   less   likely   to   break   off .   you   re   better   off   just   keeping   pacifier   wipes   handy   for   when   it   gets   dirty .   the   cost   of   replacing   the   pacifier   clip   so   often   far   exceeds   the   cost   of   the   wipes .   good   luck   congratulations   to   you   or   the   new   parents   you   re   shopping   for !
only   buy   original   wubbanub   pacifiers !   i   have   bought   lots   of   the   wubbanub   pacifiers ,   but   on   a   recent   amazon   purchase ,   i   decided   to   buy   ones   that   are   called   wubbanub ,   but   by   a   different   manufacturer   mary   meyer .   it   came ,   i   washed   it   like   all   others   and   it   fell   apart   when   i   pulled   it   out   of   the   washing   machine .   this   has   never   happened   with   the   real   wubbanubs ,   so   be   cautious   and   buy   the   original .

skip   hop   pacifer   pod   i   got   this   as   a   shower   gift   and   thought   i   could   use   it   attached   to   my   diaper   bag .   it   worked   great   until   the   snap   came   undone   and   the   whole   thing   fell   off .   and ,   it   had   2   pacifiers   in   it   one   with   a   clip   !   i   never   found   it   and   now   i   am   in   need   of   another   one .   i   don   t   think   i   will   be   getting   a   skip   hop   this   time .   i   will   search   for   one   that   will   hook   to   my   diaper   bag   in   a   more   secure   way .
awesome   product   my   baby   is   almost   4   months   old   and   absolutely   loves   it .. its   easy   for   her   to   hold   onto   and   it   goes   everywhere   with   us ...
baby   doesn   t   like   any   other ...   love   this   pacifier .   it   is   just   like   the   ones   issued   in   the   hospital   only   it   s   not   green .   i   purchased   this   because   of   it   s   girly   colors .   my   baby   doesn   t   like   any   other   pacifiers   other   than   the   soothie .   love   it   and   so   does   baby !  
shield   is   too   hard   for   my   liking   i   bought   these   adorable   pacifiers   for   my   2   month   old ,   as   i   did   not   like   how   the   shield   on   the   soothie   pacifier   she   had   been   using   was   so   large   and   was   smushing   her   nose .   the   gumdrop   s   nipple   is   nice   and   soft ,   just   like   the   soothie ,   however   the   gumdrop   s   shield   is   made   of   a   firmer   silicone .   as   my   daughter   would   sometimes   put   the   wrong   end   of   the   pacifier   in   her   mouth ,   i   didn   t   want   her   to   hurt   her   not   quite   ready   to   teeth   gums   by   sticking   the   shield   in   her   mouth .   it   s   not   as   hard   as   the   silicone   plastic   used   in   some   of   the   playtex   and   mam   shields   i   ve   seen ,   but   it   wasn   t   the   same   soft   material   its   nipple   is   made   of .
good   pacifier   we   got   this   pacifier   for   our   grandbaby   as   this   is   the   type   of   pacifier   he   was   given   in   the   hospital   he   did   not   take   the   regular   kind .   he   doesnt   really   like   using   the   pacifier   much   but   when   he   is   fussy   it   helps   a   lot .
love   it !   this   pacifier   attacher   is   great .   it   is   much   nicer   than   the   fabric   ones   and   i   love   the   skulls   perfect   for   your   bad   boy .
useful   but   quality   issue   we   can   usually   fit   three   green   soothie   pacifiers   in   one ,   or   four   nuk . with   two   little   ones   being   about   to   grab   the   right   pacifier   quickly   has   been   great .   one   of   them   has   had   the   velco   come   off ,   so   it   won   t   stay   closed ,   but   we   still   use   it .
lovely   to   start   but   faded   fast   we   were   so   excited   to   get   these   for   our   son   and   they   looked   great   upon   arrival ,   but   before   he   was   three   months ,   the   purple   and   paws   had   washed   off .
love   these !   i   didn   t   want   to   give   my   baby   any   items   with   potentially   harmful   substances   phlates   bpa   s   specifically   ,   so   i   was   searching   high   and   low   for   natural   baby   items .   i   was   very   pleased   to   find   this   item   and   my   baby   loves   chewing   on   these .   i   like   that   these   are   natural   products   and   i   feel   confident   in   giving   these   to   my   baby .
awesome   accessory   such   a   great   accessory   for   an   infant .   stuffed   toy   attached   to   nub   pacifier   keeps   paci   from   slipping   down   in   car   seats ,   beds ,   etc . ,   and   is   a   cute   plus   to   boot !   excellent   gift   for   any   young   thing !
great   little   item   just   a   nice   handy   item   to   have .   leave   it   hooked   to   the   outside   of   our   diaper   bag   for   easy   access .   easy   to   clean   too .
owned   2   and   both   lasted   less   than   2   years   i   owe   2   of   these   and   the   night   vision   has   broken   on   both   of   these   units .   i   didn   t   have   static   issues   like   others   have   noted   but   price   is   too   much   to   pay   for   something   that   lasts   less   than   2   years .
a   little   disappointed   the   color   and   pattern   are   as   expected   from   the   photo   and   i   like   the   design   look   of   the   bumper .   the   quality   is   below   average .   one   of   the   strings   broke   off   after   a   couple   of   weeks   and   it   looks   feels   flimsy .   i   spent   quite   a   bit   more   on   another   one   from   pottery   barn   and   can   definatley   tell   the   difference   in   quality .
lid   does   not   fit   i   read   the   reviews   and   thought   i   would   give   it   a   shot .   the   spoon   is   nice   and   the   bowl   is   generous   in   size ,   however ,   what   type   of   container   with   a   lid   is   it ,   if   the   lid   doesn   t   fit   properly .   i   tested   to   see   if   liquid   will   spill   and   because   the   lid   doesn   t   fit   tightly ,   it   spills .   the   lid   does   not   snap   on ,   so   it   s   useful   to   fill   with   anything   other   than   dry   food   on   the   go .   extremely   disappointed   with   this   product .   wondering   if   i   can   return   it .
item   not   as   described   i   bought   this   bag   from   another   retailer   based   on   the   description   here   on   amazon . com .   the   courier   diaper   bag   does   not   have   the   zippered   bottle   pockets .   it   also   does   not   have   the   2   outside   pockets   under   the   flap .   and   it   s   small   not   big   enough   for   a   full   day   out   at   all   imo .   we   returned   it   to   the   original   retailer .   if   you   re   looking   for   a   smallish   short   excursion   bag ,   this   would   work   fine .
boon   lawn   this   product   is   excellent !   i   can   fit   6   bottles ,   2   full   sets   of   pumping   accessories ,   several   pacifiers   and   several   other   items   on   it   at   once .   it   s   also   cute .
beware .   foot   not   as   good   as   hand   unfortunately ,   you   can   t   choose   to   get   a   foot   or   a   hand .   they   assign   it   to   the   customer   randomly .   however ,   there   are   real   differences .   the   hand   has   fingers   wide   enough   apart   that   a   baby   can   stick   a   finger   in   his   mouth .   the   foot   has   no   separation   between   digits .   it   is   one   big   clump .   very   difficult   for   baby   to   put   in   mouth   and   not   too   comfy   once   there .
just   not   big   enough   i   bought   this   bag   after   buying   and   returning   the   courier   version   of   the   same   bag .   i   thought   it   would   be   big   enough   for   me   to   have   enough   in   it   for   a   2   year   old   as   well   as   a   newborn .   it   s   just   not   big   enough   and   there   aren   t   enough   pockets .   there   is   no   where   for   mommy   s   things   to   go   and   the   bottle   pockets   aren   t   lined   so   not   sure   how   they   would   stay   cool .   it   s   a   fine   bag   although   not   sure   why   the   front   flap   comes   off ,   seems   like   that   would   be   annoying .   all   in   all   i   wouldn   t   recommend   this   bag   to   anyone .   it   s   just   really   not   practicle .
adorable   i   got   this   lamp   mainly   to   go   with   the   bedding   set ,   but   when   i   got   the   lamp   i   was   so   glad   because   it   is   so   adorable   and   it   is   defi .   worth   the   money .   i   would   recommend   anyone   that   has   a   theme   with   ladybugs   or   anything   that   would   go   with   this   lamp   to   get   it .
perfect   i   love   these .   i   was   concerned   that   the   printed   side   wouldn   t   be   as   absorbent   as   the   terry   cloth   side ,   but   both   sides   are   quick   to   absorbed   moisture .   i   like   the   small   size .   depending   on   how   i   m   using   them ,   i   like   to   have   some   large   burp   rags   and   some   small   ones .   these   ones   are   great   for   wiping   my   baby   s   mouth ,   and   because   they   re   a   little   stiff   the   work   great   to   cup   under   the   baby   s   mouth   when   holding   her   up   in   a   sit   for   a   burp .   if   your   holding   your   baby   over   your   shoulder   to   burp ,   then   these   will   definitely   be   too   small .   br   br   and   of   course ,   the   pretty   designs   are   very   nice .   not   exactly   as   pictured   though .   i   received   two   with   flowered   patters   and   two   with   the   diamonds .   no   solid .   i   m   okay   with   that .   i   ordered   these   and   the   green   ones .   they   came   prettily   wrapped   in   a   large   ribbon   that   says   eat   all   over   it   very   cute   with   a   large   button   on   the   front ,   not   a   knot .   great   for   a   gifts ,   but   i   got   them   for   myself .  
one   of   our   best   baby   purchases   my   husband   and   i   purchased   this   for   our   son   when   he   was   four   months   old .   it   is   one   of   the   best   purchases   we   have   made   for   him .   we   wanted   a   jumper   that   didn   t   make   noise ,   have   lots   of   attached   toys   and   didn   t   take   up   too   much   space .   this   doorway   jumper   meets   all   of   these   criteria .   our   son   quickly   figured   out   how   to   jump   and   was   soon   entertaining   himself   for   at   least   twenty   minutes .   he   has   been   in   it   for   as   long   as   an   hour   without   wanting   out .   the   doorway   jumper   enabled   us   to   work   in   the   kitchen ,   do   something   in   the   dining   room   and   eat   without   a   fussy   baby .   prior   to   having   the   jumper ,   our   son   only   entertained   himself   for   maybe   10   minutes   at   a   time .   i   will   say   that   this   jumper   works   for   our   house   because   we   have   a   very   wide   doorway   between   the   kitchen   and   the   dining   room .   our   son   is   a   vigorous   jumper   and   in   a   narrower   doorway   he   would   be   bumping   into   the   door   frame .   still ,   we   thoroughly   enjoy   watching   our   son   happily   bouncing   not   only   up   and   down ,   but   as   far   as   the   spring   allows ,   back   and   forth   like   a   swing   and   in   wide   circles .   the   only   down   side   to   this   jumper   is   that   our   seven   month   old   son   weighs   around   23   pounds   and   will   soon   be   too   heavy   to   use   it .   i   gave   it   four   stars   because   five   stars   implies   perfection   and   no   product   is   perfect .   this   works   for   our   son ,   but   might   not   work   for   other   babies .
i   love   it !   this   product   is   a   must   buy !   i   originally   recieved   this   as   a   gift   when   pregnant   with   my   son ... he   is   now   14   months   old   and   has   a   little   sis   on   the   way   and   still   loves   watching   and   playing   with   this   mobile !   there   are   two   volume   settings   for   the   tunes   which   are   perfectly   set .   of   the   two   volume   settings   one   is   set   to   be   fairly   quiet   for   nighttime   and   napping   and   then   there   is   the   higher   setting   for   playtime .   the   animals   are   very   vibrant   in   color   and   the   moving   leaves   are   adorable .   there   is   also   a   night   light   setting   as   well .   you   also   have   the   option   of   3   sets   of   tunes   or   rainforest   nature   noises .   this   is   truly   a   wonderful   item   that   i   recommend   for   everyone   whether   it   matches   the   theme   of   the   room   or   not .   my   son   absolutely   loved   watching   all   of   the   moving   animals   and   leaves ... i   would   joke   that   he   thought   going   to   bed   was   playtime   because   he   would   get   so   excited   to   see   his   mobile .   excellent   item !
terrible   i   bought   this   for   my   daughter   and   it   was   terrible .   it   leaks   from   the   bottom   as   if   it   its   missing   a   piece   and   came   with   no   instructions   of   how   to   assemble .
great   for   some   doors ,   not   others   i   purchased   this   for   the   door   leading   to   the   basement   wood .   it   was   easy   to   install   and   works   great   to   keep   my   2   year   old   from   opening   the   door .   i   then   bought   one   for   our   front   door .   however ,   i   have   not   been   able   to   get   it   to   stay   adhered   metal .   so   frustrated .
speaker   broke   down   i   have   purchased   this   set   and   it   worked   well   until   the   speaker   broke   all   of   a   suddent .   now   only   video   works   and   not   audio .   in   addition ,   the   range   is   not   great   and   with   a   single   wall   you   may   lose   connectivity .
nice   wrapping   paper   colors   are   vivid .   paper   was   good   quality .   came   early   and   in   good   shape .   like   the   fact   of   reversible   sides .   added   value   and   all   that .
perfect   fit   for   graco   pack   n   play   this   is   a   very   thick   mattress   and   it   fits   the   bottom   of   my   child   s   graco   modern   pack   n   play   playard   with   bassinet   and   changer ,   zurich   perfectly .   one   thing   to   note   i   also   purchased   a   water   proof   liner   for   the   mattress   but   it   is   not   necessary   because   this   mattress   is   made   of   water   proof   material .
so   cute   i   bought   this   as   a   baby   gift   after   seeing   my   nephew   using   his .   hope   this   helps   my   friend   never   loose   a   pacifier   again .   the   only   thing   i   m   not   crazy   about   is   the   pacifier   is   stuck   there .   it   can   t   be   removed .   it   would   be   nice   to   be   able   to   change   the   pacifier .   other   than   that   it   looks   like   a   great   baby   gift .
cute !   their   nice ,   strong ,   easy   to   clean   and   boil ,   super   cute   and   good   to   go   for   football   season !   great   over   all   passys !
broke   the   first   time   i   used   it   save   your   money !   i   used   this   the   first   time   i   took   my   son   to   the   doctor   and   it   fell   and   broke   in   half !
my   child   favors   it !   i   wasn   t   sure   about   pacifiers ,   but   got   this   from   a   ecostore   that   was   closing   down   before   my   child   arrived   and   when   she   seemed   colicky   and   as   i   read   viewed   happiest   baby   on   block ,   i   decided   to   dig   it   out   of   all   the   new   baby   stuff .   she   isn   t   a   big   pacifier   girl ,   but   as   we   struggled   with   colicky   type   symptoms ,   i   also   got   the   traditional   paci   from   the   store .   she   definitely   prefers   this   one   to   the   others .   it   seems   yesterday   we   dropped   lost   it .   hence ,   i   am   here   trying   to   figure   out   what   to   do   to   replace   it .
best   paci !   this   is   the   only   paci   my   son   would   take .   like   what   others   said ,   this   was   given   in   the   hospital   he   was   born .   it   was   really   a   life   saver   on   those   fussy   moments !   helpful   to   have   a   couple   of   these   in   your   bag ,   car ,   crib ,   daycare   etc !
love   these   pacifiers .   i   was   always   a   fan   of   the   soothie   pacifiers   but   didn   t   like   how   big   they   were   around .   i   think   these   are   just   what   i   needed .   my   son   loves   them   and   the   blue   is   so   pretty .
love   this   item !   this   pacifier   is   so   easy   to   find .   we   have   had   two   for   over   a   year   and   my   daughter   can   find   it   easily   on   her   own .   great   product !
4.5   rating   really   mr .   toutou   is   my   daughter   s   friend .   she   s   had   him   since   she   was   about   3   mo   old ,   up   to   now   11   mos   .   when   she   dropped   and   lost   him   one   time ,   we   got   her   another   one .   mr .   toutou   can   calm   her   at   night   when   she   wakes   up   in   the   dark ,   and   she   goes   back   to   sleep   on   her   own .   she   likes   to   suck   on   the   pacifier ,   the   ears ,   the   limbs ,   everywhere !   it   s   good   that   the   pacifier   detaches   and   i   can   wash   the   stuff   toy   part .   now   that   she   s   teething ,   she   also   bites   the   circle   around   the   pacifier   suprisingly ,   not   the   pacifier   itself .   the   only   reasone   this   gets   a   4.5   instead   of   5   is   when   we   got   mt   2.0 ,   we   noticed   that   the   ears   are   much   shorter   than   the   original   mt .   we   loved   the   floppy   ears .   oh   well ...   it   s   still   great ,   all   around .
not   the   same   as   the   picture   the   pacifier   in   the   picture   is   not   the   one   that   we   received .   br   br   i   normally   do   not   write   these   types   of   reviews   and   don   t   like   it   when   i   see   these   because   it   does   not   review   the   product .   but   i   don   t   want   anyone   else   to   go   through   what   i   did .   br   br   the   one   that   we   received   is   the   regular   avent ,   which   we   can   buy   in   the   store   for   less .   our   daughter   does   love   the   regular   ones .   br   br   i   noticed   that   the   picture   has   now   been   changed   11   15   2011   .
my   completly   breast   fed   son   just   spit   it   out !   i   bought   these   pacifiers   because   of   other   reviews   that   their   babies   liked   the   pacifier ,   and   they   were   breast   fed   babies .   my   son   did   not   like   these   wish   i   would   not   have   purchased   them .   i   do   like   the   design   better   that   the   ones   that   you   get   at   the   hospital .   my   son   will   suck   on   the   mam   pacifiers   for   a   while .   i   think   it   is   because   these   have   nothing   for   him   to   get   latched   onto   and   the   mam   pacifier   kinda   bows   out   to   the   sides .
so   cute ! !   fast   shipment ! ! !   my   daughter   loves   it !   very   cute ! !   love   that   its   so   easy   to   find   at   night ! !   can   t   wait   to   buy   more ! ! !
good   pacifier   worked   great   for   my   son ,   especially   when   he   had   colic .   he   s   3   months   now   and   doesn   t   need   it   nearly   as   much ,   but   it   was   a   lifesaver   during   those   first   few   months .
savior   but   buy   extra   if   you   have   dogs !   our   6   month   old   must   have   dragon   to   fall   asleep   he   s   a   savior !   plus ,   unlike   a   regular   pacifier ,   he   s   easy   to   keep   a   hand   on   so   he   won   t   fall   on   the   floor .   and   we   sometimes   tether   him ,   too .   the   only   problem   is   that   the   dogs   have   destroyed   two   of   them .   so   if   you   have   dogs ,   get   a   couple   extra   dragons .
have   a   soothie   paci   in   every   room   i   am   a   nurse   and   this   is   the   paci   that   is   used   in   many   of   the   hospitals   i   have   worked   in   and   this   was   the   paci   of   choice   at   the   hospial   my   twins   were   born   in .   the   paci   did   not   deter   my   twins   from   breastfeeding   and   it   does   not   leave   those   awful   marks   on   their   faces   that   some   of   the   other   pacifiers   do .   this   is   the   only   paci   i   will   use   and   have   two   in   every   room   of   my   home   and   4   6   of   them   in   my   diaper   bag ! ! ! !
it   does   the   job   i   purchased   2   one   came   in   great   condition ,   and   the   other   one   needed   to   be   replaced   because   it   opened   to   easily !   the   replacement   one   was   better   but   not   as   great   as   the   other   one .   no   hassle   in   exchanging   and   shipping   was   quick !
so   cute   i   saw   a   little   boy   with   one   of   these   and   had   to   order   one   for   my   son .   it   s   so   cute   when   you   look   at   it ,   and   when   my   son   is   using   it ,   even   cuter !   many   variations   to   choose   from   but   i   chose   the   doggie !   well   made !
great   for   new   babies   this   is   the   paci   they   gave   my   son   in   the   hospital   and   it   was   his   favorite !   however ,   his   granny   was   watching   him   one   day   and   her   dog   chewed   up   his   paci   so   we   had   to   get   more ..   i   liked   the   price ,   the   colors ,   and   the   free   shipping   so   i   ordered   them ,   but   when   they   got   here ,   my   son   already   prefered   a   different   one ,   so   i   kind   of   wasted   my   money ,   but   this   is   awesome   for   new   babies   and   the   bulb   is   the   perfect   size !
works   well   my   almost   6   month   old   loves   these .   it   s   not   much   larger   than   the   one   he   used   after   the   smoothie   ones   from   the   hospital   but   we   like   that   it   doesn   t   mash   into   his   big   cheeks   and   the   clear   allows   us   to   see   more   of   his   sweet   face   since   he   s   got   it   in   all   the   time   !
great   at   first   then   it   s   not   worth   20   after   it   being   not   used   as   a   pacifier   just   left   thrown   on   the   floor   of   the   play   gym ,   i   decided   to   take   a   cloth   and   clean   it ,   well   that   was   no   good   it   s   not   of   good   quality   the   plush   toy   has   alot   of   fuzzy   balls   and   looks   old .   this   is   not   worth   20   no   matter   what   the   seller   says   to   justify   the   price   of   10   shipping   and   handling .   not   worth   it ,   go   buy   a   regular   soothie   and   a   plush   toy   animal   for   less .
we   love   this   too   death ! ! !   not   only   is   it   adorable   but   my   daughter   loves   it .   its   her   friend   as   well   as   a   soother .   i   have   sewn   new   binkies   on   it   when   our   dog   ate   it   off   and   we   have   never   lost   this .   i   m   buying   this   as   a   shower   gift   for   every   shower   i   go   too !   the   best   part   is   they   go   with   any   theme   and   when   its   time   to   say   goodbye   to   the   binky   they   can   keep   their   friend   forever !
last   a   long   time   i   have   been   using   these   since   my   now   3yr   old   was   born .   they   last   a   long   time   and   don   t   get   all   gross   like   some   other   brands   from   daily   use .   if   you   get   water   inside   them ,   they   will   squeak   when   baby   sucks   it   and   get   gross .   so   i   always   dip   the   nipple   in   water   then   wipe   it   clean .   also   you   will   need   to   clean   around   the   base   of   the   nipple   part   where   it   attaches   to   the   hard   plastic .   there   can   be   buildup   of   milk ,   formula ,   food ,   etc .   you   will   want   to   clean   out .   again ,   just   dip   the   nipple   part   under   hot   water   then   use   your   fingernail   or   a   towel   to   wipe   the   buildup   away   from   the   base .   do   not   submerge   or   it   will   squeak   when   baby   uses   it   which   kept   mine   awake   bc   of   the   noise   it   made   and   grow   all   kind   of   nasty   mold   inside   the   nipple .   just   dip   it   into   hot   water .   i   would   check   about   using   the   microwave   bag   for   sterilizing   not   sure   if   these   are   rated   for   that .
best   pacifiers   these   are   the   pacifiers   that   they   gave   us   in   the   hospital   and   the   only   ones   my   daughter   would   take .   at   the   time ,   they   didn   t   sell   them   in   any   stores   so   i   ordered   here .   was   very   happy   with   them .   they   now   sell   them   at   target   babies   r   us   too .
nice   idea ,   but   can   t   clean   paci ...   i   bought   this   for   my   granddaughter   and   was   diaappointed   to   find   that   the   paci   could   not   be   removed   for   cleaning   or   changing   to   a   different   pacifier ,   as   baby   grows . the   concept   is   great ,   and   there   are   other   manufacturers   who   do   make   units   where   the   paci   can   be   changed   out .   i   wish   i   had   done   a   little   more   research .
better   as   a   teether   bought   this   for   my   6   month   old   because   i   liked   that   the   pacifier   is   molded   from   one   piece   of   rubber .   my   son   likes   to   use   it   as   a   teether   more   than   as   a   pacifier .   still   good   though .
those   are   the   only   ones   that   my   niece   uses   we   tried   different   styles   and   brands   before   and   she   didn   t   like   them .   but   she   likes   this   a   lot .   it   works   so   she   stops   crying   when   there   is   nothing   else   to   do .
great   pacifier   for   teething   my   son   never   really   sucked   on   binkies   but   he   does   love   this   one ,   now ,   at   14   months .   mostly   to   chew   on   and   suck   a   little   bit   with   his   teething ,   but   it   is   a   really   great   pacifier .   i   love   the   natural   materials   and   it   is   quite   soft ,   more   so   than   the   silicone   ones .   it   is   a   bit   waxy   and   rubbery   smelling   at   first   but   if   you   sanitize   it   before   first   use   as   it   states ,   it   goes   away .   the   waxy   part   is   a   natural   coating   from   the   rubber   and   will   fade .
best   binky   on   the   market ...   there   are   lots   of   styles   of   binkies   out   there ,   this   one   is   only   one   our   baby   likes .   have   a   few   of   these ,   in   your   diaper   bag ,   purse   and   stroller ...
superb   pacifier   i   could   not   find   the   mam   perfect   readily   available   in   stores .   i   purchased   online   and   my   daughter   loves   the   mam   perfect .   in   fact   i   have   several   in   every   color .   they   are   truly   very   thin   and   soft .   she   s   used   other   mam   pacifiers   and   teethers   before ,   so   i   had   a   hunch   she   would   like   this   pacifier .   this   has   by   far   been   her   favorite   pacifier .   i   am   recommending   this   product   to   all   my   mommy   friends   whose   babies   use   pacifiers .
best   paci   ever   this   is   the   paci   that   my   baby   was   given   in   the   hospital   and   the   only   one   she   will   still   take .   i   had   to   order   more   just   in   case   we   ever   lost   the   one   and   i   love   amazon   because   shopping   with   a   baby   isn   t   very   easy ... awesome   product ,   awesome   service .
my   favorite   pacifier   i   love   these   pacifiers .   the   design   is   cute   and   they   hold   up   well   in   the   dishwasher .   my   favorite   part   is   that   they   come   with   a   snap   on   cover   so   the   pacifier   stays   clean   in   your   diaper   bag   or   purse .   much   better   than   using   a   baggie   or   pacifier   holder   that   just   takes   up   more   room .   i   will   be   ordering   more   of   these .
small   pacifier   i   was   looking   for   a   first   essential   pacifier   that   looks   exactly   like   this   one   for   my   grandson .   however ,   this   nipple   is   a   little   smaller   than   the   one   he   currently   uses   and   he   can   tell   the   difference   and   refuses   to   take   it .
not   so   great   i   ordered   these   for   our   newborn   since   i   read   so   many   good   reviews   and   these   are   the   kind   the   hospital   uses .   our   daughter   just   didn   t   like   them .   i   ended   up   just   throwing   them   away .   i   guess   it   is   just   the   baby   s   preference ,   she   likes   other   brands   but   not   these .
all   the   first   would   use   second   wouldn   t   touch   them   i   got   one   of   these   at   the   hospital ,   and   it   is   the   only   pacifier   my   son   has   ever   accepted .   highly   recommend   you   at   least   try   it   if   you   haven   t   already .   it   s   great ,   because   you   can   stick   your   finger   in   and   babies   tend   to   latch   onto   it   better   when   you   do .   br   br   and   they   look   like   a   suckerfish ,   as   you   can   see   by   looking   down   the   translucent   nub .   it   s   entertaining   and   useful .   br   br   and   i   totally   don   t   laugh   at   my   child .   br   br   update   10   18   2013   br   my   second   son   is   now   four   months   old   and   he   has   never   once   liked   these   pacifiers .   it   is   true   that   all   babies   are   different ,   and   they   all   have   mouths   of   different   shapes   and   sizes .   it   always   seems   like   it   is   awkward   for   him   to   latch   onto   the   soothies   i   ve   tried   both   the   0   3   month   and   next   size   up   .   they   work   okay   if   we   can   hold   our   finger   there ,   but   once   we   let   go   he   spits   it   right   out .   br   br   i   am   leaving   my   rating   at   five   stars   because   they   were   still   a   lifesaver   with   my   first   born .   they   are   a   quality   product   made   out   of   a   sturdy   material ,   and   the   shape   is   brilliant   it   is   never   going   to   get   swallowed   .   i   also   recommend   trying   a   few   types ,   though .   nuk   is   his   favorite .   hope   this   helps !
average   these   pacifiers   are   average ,   not   bad ,   but   there   is   definitely   better .   my   son   is   now   five   months   and   does   not   use   a   pacifier   at   all .   between   five   weeks   and   four   months   he   really   seemed   to   prefer   the   gumdrop   pacifiers .   my   only   real   complaint   is   that   the   soothie   covered   his   nose .   not   ideal   when   baby   is   sleeping   and   could   potentially   be   hazardous   if   left   unattended .   we   did   not   have   this   problem   when   he   was   a   little   older   but   i   still   would   not   reccomend   this   pacifier   when   there   are   many   more   to   choose   from .   granted   all   babies   are   different   and   some   will   prefer   one   thing   over   another ... the   choice   is   yours .
rubber   smell   in   contrast   to   the   good   reviews   here ,   my   4   month   old   daugther   refuses   it   br   because   of   its   disgusting   smell .   br   for   a   first   couple   of   weeks ,   it   was   good .   however ,   after   that   it   smells   like   feet  
great   gift   item !   we   received   a   wubbanub   as   a   baby   shower   gift   for   our   now   5   1   2   month   old   baby .   she   loves   it !   initially   i   thought   we   would   not   use   it ,   but   as   it   happens ,   grandma   popped   it   in   her   mouth   while   we   were   out   one   night   when   baby   was   only   a   few   weeks   old   and   it   was   an   instant   hit   we   had   previously   only   tried   a   couple   other   brands ,   which   she   rejected   history   was   made   and   we   have   a   slew   of   pictures   to   document   her   fondness !   only   at   over   5   months   old   now ,   it   has   become   a   bit   of   a   distraction   when   trying   to   get   her   down   she   loves   to   play   with   it   giraffe   is   what   we   have ,   which   is   totally   cute   and   the   stuffed   animal   is   something   to   tug   on ,   thus   pulling   it   out   of   her   mouth .   i   vowed   to   give   this   as   future   shower   gifts   and   just   sent   the   ella   bella   elephant   one   to   my   sister .   i   hope   her   new   little   one   likes   it ,   i   haven   t   gotten   any   feedback   yet .   i   have   now   been   searching   for   a   binky   that   is   of   similar   feel   but   without   the   stuffed   animal   something   that   won   t   be   distracting   for   when   we   are   trying   to   put   her   down .   we   will   still   use   this   one   for   awhile   yet ,   though .   cleaning   is   not   too   much   of   an   issue   can   either   throw   it   in   the   washing   machine   or   hand   wash   to   clean   the   animal .
good   pacifer   these   are   great   pacifers ,   however   go   to   the   store   to   buy   them .   ordered   them   thinking   that   they   will   be   gender   neutral   colors ,   but   they   are   not .   i   have   a   baby   boy   and   amazon   sent   pink   pacifers ,   and   amazon   won   t   let   you   pick   the   color .   amazon   either   needs   to   send   gender   neutral   color   pacifers   or   let   you   pick   the   color .
alternative   uses   my   daughter   does   not   routinely   suck   on   pacifiers ,   but   at   10   months   old ,   these   infant   pacifiers   other   brands   can   use   harder   plastic   the   soft   material   seems   to   work   best   are   her   favorite   teether .   she   sticks   a   thumb   in   the   hole   and   uses   the   mouthpiece   as   a   sort   of   cushion   so   that   it   doesn   t   hurt   if   she   chews   bites   her   thumb .   i   attach   the   ribbon   clip   to   the   edge   of   the   pacifier   so   that   she   can   grip   it   she   also   sucks   on   the   ribbon .
yes   colors   do   vary   pacifiers   are   great   but   not   this   item   i   would   give   the   mam   pacifier   a   5   star ,   but   i   m   rating   this   particular   item   with   1   star   couse   you   do   get   any   color ,   bought   2   for   my   son   and   got   a   green   set   good   and   a   purple   set .   br   they   list   an   item   model   number   that   correspond   to   the   blue   one   in   the   first   picture ,   but   you   will   get   any .   so   save   your   time   and   maybe   pay   a   bit   more   but   buy   the   color   you   want .
oh   no ,   i   got   the   pink   one !   wahhh   i   ordered   these   because   these   are   the   kind   of   binks   that   my   kid   likes .   he   is   very   soothed   by   them   and   goes   right   back   to   sleep   if   im   quick   enough .   i   saw   that   the   colors   could   vary ,   but   if   i   really   cared   that   much   about   what   color   the   things   were   i   would   have   driven   my   lazy   butt   to   the   store   and   picked   some   out   in   person .   i   put   the   pink   one   up   as   an   emergency   back   up   and   attached   the   green   and   blue   one   to   his   pacifier   clip .   tragedy   averted .
so   cute !   i   was   looking   for   pacifiers   and   came   across   this .   it   is   the   cutest   thing .   i   haven   t   had   a   chance   to   use   it   yet   as   i   still   have   two   months   to   go .   my   friends   that   have   seen   it   want   one   so   i   will   be   buying   a   few   more   to   give   as   gifts .
pretty   good   my   baby   liked   it   for   a   couple   weeks   only ...... after   that   he   liked   it   as   a   toy   more   than   a   pacifier !   however   i   liked   how   it   stayed   close   to   my   son   so   he   could   suck   on   it   anytime !
wrong   color   i   bought   these   for   my   son .   i   wanted   the   blue   or   the   yellow   ones   but   received   the   pink   ones .   it   does   say   colors   may   vary ,   i   did   not   notice   that .   it   was   very   confusing   that   the   pacifiers   were   displayed   as   blue .   it   should   be   possible   to   choose   color .   i   don   t   want   my   son   to   have   a   pink   pacifier .   blue   for   a   girl   is   perfectly   fine ,   but   pink   for   a   boy   feels   wrong   to   me .   the   pacifiers   are   great .   used   them   for   both   my   other   kids ,   but   these   ones   will   only   be   used   for   emergency   cases .
most   valuable   baby   item   we   ve   had   so   far !   absolutely   love   these .   my   son   latched   on   from   the   very   beginning   with   our   help   by   putting   our   finger   into   the   hole .   i   love   that   it   doesn   t   obstruct   his   little   nose .   he   falls   asleep   sucking   on   these ,   and   it   keeps   him   calm   while   i   prepare   to   feed   him .   being   a   breastfeeding   mother ,   i   also   feel   good   about   the   natural   shape   of   the   pacifier .
very   useful !   this   is   very   useful   in   the   car   seat   when   the   baby   is   too   small   to   hold   in   the   paci .   it   will   help   keep   the   paci   in   the   mouth .   she   can   hold   it   easy   too !   now   that   she   is   8   motnhs   old ,   we   put   it   in   her   crib   with   her   and   if   she   wakes   up   she   can   find   it   herself   and   put   it   in   her   mouth .   again ,   i   can   not   say   how   great   this   was   for   the   car   seat !   it   washes   easy   in   the   washing   machine .   i   buy   these   for   every   baby   shower   i   go   to .   they   are   cute ,   cuddly ,   and   work   great ! ! ! !   we   love   this   product ! !
just   like   the   hospital   we   purchased   these   for   our   daughter   because   she   will   only   take   the   pacifiers   from   the   hospital .   these   are   just   like   the   ones   we   received   there ,   but   in   pretty   girly   colors .
love   them   my   daughter   s   favorite   and   now   mine .   can   t   find   them   in   stores   so   amazon   makes   it   so   easy   to   order   them .
great   product   we   purchased   the   monkey   wubbanub   for   our   son   when   he   was   six   weeks   old .   it   has   become   such   a   staple   in   our   lives   that   we   thought   we   had   better   get   a   back   up   because   our   lives   would   be   very   difficult   if   we   should   ever   lose   monkey !   we   purchased   the   lion   wubbanub   and   he   loves   it   just   as   much .   it   s   cute   because   he   likes   to   hold   onto   his   mane   while   he   s   sucking   away .   this   thing   is   a   lifesaver ,   trust   me !
pleased   it   didn   t   take   long   for   my   infant   daughter   to   ditch   pacifiers   for   conventional   use ,   but   she   loves   to   teeth   on   this   one .   she   gets   creative   with   it   and   sticks   her   thumb   through   the   back ,   into   the   nipple   to   suck   and   gnaw   on   it .   i   m   happy   for   the   unique   design   of   this   product ,   she   won   t   bother   with   any   of   the   other   brands .
nothing   beats   the   soothie   both   of   my   sons   refused   every   pacifier   except   the   soothie   for   the   first   few   months   of   their   lives .   they   even   rejected   the   new   gumdrop   pacifiers ,   which   are   similar   to   these   but   do   not   touch   baby   s   nose .   apparently   my   boys   like   these   even   though   they   look   too   big   for   a   newborn .   must   be   something   comforting   about   it .
love   these   things   we   love   all   the   wubanub   pacis .   my   baby ,   a   preemie   by   two   months ,   has   loved   the   monkey   wubanub   since   he   was   around   4   months .   he   is   now   10   months   old   and   it   is   a   critical   part   of   his   bedtime   routine .   i   bought   this   elephant   as   a   baby   shower   gift .
she   loved   it !   i   ordered   this   for   my   girlfriend   as   an   early   birthday   present !   it   arrived   in   four   days ,   packed   well   was   in   great   condition !   would   definately   deal   with   you   guys   again !   paul   tucson , az
great   product ! ! ! !   i   love   this   product !   i   try   to   use   natural   things   for   my   baby   and   this   pacifier   is   perfect .   i   m   pregnant   with   my   second   child   and   plan   on   using   again .   i   recommend   using   this   pacifier   above   all   other   natural   rubber   pacifiers .   i   have   tried   the   natursutten   ones   and   do   not   like   them   at   all ! !   the   way   the   little   handle   is   it   jus   collects   fuzz   and   dirt   that   you   cannot   get   off !   absolutely   horrible !   so   i   recommend   this   product   above   all   others ..   and   i   think   my   daughter   would   agree !   she   loves   it   too !   hope   this   helps !
not   the   same   as   original   gumdrop   tried   several   different   pacifiers   and   our   daughter   would   only   take   the   original   one   given   to   her   at   the   hospital .   we   got   tired   of   washing   the   same   pacifier   over   and   over   again   so   when   we   saw   first   years   made   the   gumdrop   pacifier ,   we   were   very   excited .   unfortunately ,   this   is   not   the   same   pacifier   it   is   squeakier   more   plasticky   than   the   original   rubbery   one   and   less   flexible .   in   conclusion ,   just   buy   the   hawaii   medical   group   one   because   this   one   is   just   a   waste   of   money .   i   am   giving   it   only   1   star   because   i   feel   i   was   misled   by   the   name   which   makes   me   mad .   if   first   years   insists   on   making   a   copy   of   the   original ,   they   need   to   give   it   a   copy   like   name   for   example   raindrop   or   gumball   i   don   t   know ,   just   a   thought   .
good   pacifiers   the   pacifiers   are   very   good   products .   the   only   problem   is   that   my   youngest   daughter   doesn   t   like   them   very   much .   i   still   doesn   t   found   one   she   likes .
does   it   s   job   wish   this   was   a   tad   bit   shorter   so   i   could   climb   over   it   easier ...   but   it   does   the   job   and   i   m   really   glad   i   have   it .   saves   a   lot   of   clean   up .
perfect !   i   ordered   my   first   package   of   these   a   week   or   so   ago   and   have   already   bought   more !   they   are   perfect   reusable   cloth   diaper   liners .   they   are   not   doublers   and   do   not   add   any   more   absorption ,   rather   they   allow   urine   to   pass   through   them   and   wick   away   moisture   from   your   baby   s   bum .   they   also   make   cleaning   up   poo   much   easier   and   cut   down   on   staining   the   actual   insert   or   shell   of   the   diaper .   i   use   these   with   my   best   bottom   hemp   inserts .   hemp   takes   a   little   longer   to   absorb   than   micro   terry   and   my   baby   s   bum   was   suffering .   these   liners   give   the   hemp   time   to   do   their   job   while   keeping   the   moisture   away   from   my   little   one   s   sensitive   skin .   i   like   that   they   are   thin   and   do   not   add   any   bulk .   so   far ,   they   have   stayed   in   place   perfectly   for   us .   thank   you   bummis   for   a   perfect   and   inexpensive   solution .
beautiful ,   soft   cradle   bumper   its   a   shame   that   this   cradle   bumper   has   received   poor   reviews   just   because   the   reviewers   thought   it   was   for   a   cradle .   we   used   this   bumper   with   matching   sheets   every   night   for   my   daughter   s   first   three   months .   it   was   soft ,   beautiful ,   and   washed   without   any   problems .
she   likes   it !   i   bought   this   for   my   daughter   who   is   now   3   mos .   old .   she   has   reflux   and   has   to   be   sitting   up   at   all   times   to   keep   her   bottles   down .   i   bought   this   to   keep   her   upright   and   give   her   bouncy   seat   a   break !   the   first   night   she   slept   in   it   she   absolutely   loved   it .   i   put   her   in   it   for   her   morning   nap   and   rocked   it   a   little   bit   just   to   see   her   smile   so   big !   she   loves   it !
undersized   decent   quality   onesies   but   definitely   undersized .   my   average   size   newborn   was   able   to   wear   them   for   about   7   10   days   and   they   have   became   too   short .   and   now   being   about   month   old ,   0   3   months   size   is   tight   already .
awesome   car   seat   we   bought   this   car   seat   for   my   husband   s   car   we   only   had   one   in   my   car   .   the   one   i   have   is   the   britax   blvd   and   this   graco   comfortsport   is   comfortable ,   and   very   secure   check   the   consumer   report   ratings ,   very   high   security   wise   .   the   only   bad   thing   was   the   head   support ,   we   ended   up   removing   it   and   my   toddler   doesn   t   need   it   anymore ... it   still   is   not   a   big   deal   overall   highly   recommended   for   its   safety   reviews ,   comfort   and   price !   great   purchase !
could   not   close   the   door   or   it   would   shut   the   power   off !   i   have   a   basic   single   row   power   strip ,   and   i   couldn   t   shut   the   smaller   side   door   or   it   would   depress   the   power   switch ...   therefore   making   this   completely   useless   to   me .   the   snap   buttons   are   hard   to   open   and   close ,   so   it   would   be   good   to   keep   little   fingers   out ,   but   i   just   couldnt   use   it   for   my   power   strip .   the   stip   i   have   is   similar   to   this   one ,   ...   but   not   exactly   the   same .   mine   is   dark   color   and   newer   looking   with   spots   labeled   adapter   so   you   can   plug   in   large   plugs   and   not   lose   any   outlet   space .
cupcake   cover   for   boppy   pillow   this   is   super   cute   and   soft   the   boppy   i   had   came   with   a   boy   theme   so   i   was   really   happy   to   get   a   girly   theme   for   my   daughter .
fits   perfect ,   very   durable   fits   perfectly   over   my   chicco   cortina   travel   system   stroller .   its   a   great   fit   with   or   without   the   car   seat .   its   made   of   a   heavy ,   durable   feeling   plastic .   glad   i   purchased   this   one .   br   only   complaint   is   that   it   s   hard   to   fold   up   and   fit   back   in   the   bag   but   i   just   fold   it   up   and   take   it   along .   it   s   fine .
safe   and   easy   to   install   i   had   a   hard   time   deciding   between   this   seat   and   the   britax   chaperone ,   after   a   lot   of   reviewing ,   i   ultimately   decided   on   the   britax   mostly   because   it   was   made   in   the   usa   and   had   the   side   impact   beams   and   has   a   reputation   for   being   a   very   robust   seat .   i   drive   a   roomy   cross   over   suv ,   despite   that   the   britax   was   very   bulky   and   i   was   not   able   to   put   the   front   passenger   seat   back   very   far ,   additionally ,   the   britax   had   a   lot   of   play   in   it   and   would   be   level   one   minute   then   we   would   drive   around   and   not   be   level   the   next .   i   figured   it   was   a   user   error   and   therefore   took   the   seat   to   a   certified   installation   technician   at   our   sheriff   s   office .   they   had   the   same   problem ... not   to   mention ,   the   britax   broke   in   the   middle   of   installation ! !   the   shoulder   harness   adjustment   lever   popped   out   when   the   bolt   broke   in   half   in   addition   to   breaking ,   it   was   quite   difficult   to   maneuver   and   the   installation   technician   did   express   that   the   britax   just   didn   t   seem   to   be   a   good   fit   for   the   vehicle   2009   toyota   not   to   mention   a   huge   safety   concern   if   that   would   have   broke   in   an   accident ,   the   baby   would   have   come   right   out   of   the   seat .   when   i   did   the   return   at   amazon ,   the   rep   commented   that   he   suspects   this   issue   with   the   breakage   will   result   in   a   recall   because   it   was   on   such   a   critical   component   of   the   seat .   i   read   some   reviews   on   amazon   and   decided   on   the   chicco   keyfit   to   replace   the   britax .... the   difference   is   night   and   day ! !   the   chicco   is   lightweight ,   very   easy   to   install ,   was   level   on   the   first   try   and   stayed   that   way   and   much   less   bulky   i   can   put   front   the   seat   all   the   way   back .   my   husband   and   i   installed   it   in   less   than   5   minutes   and   it   is   very   snug .   additionally ,   the   shoulder   harness   adjustment   lever   is   so   easy   to   pull   in   and   out   when   putting   the   baby   in .   everything   about   this   seat   is   easier   and   more   user   friendly .   i   liked   the   idea   of   the   britax   being   so   bulky   i   thought   that   would   mean   it   was   a   safer   seat ,   but   given   that   we   couldn   t   get   it   level   or   snug   and   then   it   broke ,   it   is   very   clear   to   me   that   the   usa   made ,   highly   overpriced   seat   just   isn   t   up   to   par   with   the   chicco   keyfit   30 .   additionally ,   i   got   the   chicco   on   sale   and   saved   over   40   compared   to   what   i   paid   for   the   britax .
it   does   the   job   when   my   first   child   was   born   health   insurances   still   paid   for   pump   rentals   so   i   had   medela   lactina   for   a   year .   i   never   had   any   problems   with   it   or   with   my   milk   supply .   i   only   had   to   pump   for   about   10   min .   when   my   second   child   was   born   insurances   no   longer   paid   for   pumps   so   i   splurged   and   bought   freestyle .   this   pump   has   a   2   stage   extraction   so   i   was   hoping   that   i   would   need   to   pump   for   less   than   10   min .   but   it   wasn   t   the   case .   i   had   to   go   up   to   15   min   and   could   still   hand   express   after   that .   i   did   pump   a   lot   more   than   my   child   was   eating .   but   i   also   had   plugged   ducts   and   milk   blisters   every   once   in   a   while .   never   had   the   same   issue   with   lactina .   but   it   s   possible   that   i   simply   had   more   milk   with   my   second   kid .   all   in   all   the   pump   lasted   for   a   year   of   very   heavy   use   3   4   times   a   day   5   days   a   week   .   it   s   a   decent   small   pump ,   it   does   the   job   and   takes   the   abuse   quietly .   i   would   definitely   recommend   it   but   not   necessarily   over   a   hospital   grade   one .   i   found   the   hands   free   kit   to   be   useless .   it   takes   too   much   time   to   setup   and   not   very   comfortable .   but   i   like   the   digital   timer .   i   didn   t   have   to   look   at   the   watch   every   few   minutes .
cute   but   fragile   i   bought   this   for   my   8   year   old   daughter   and   she   loved   it .   it   s   probably   a   little   small   for   her   to   get   the   full   value   in   terms   of   a   neck   rest ,   but   her   joy   in   using   it   is   not   diminished   by   that   fact .   the   problem   is   that   she   s   also   playing   with   it   as   a   stuffed   animal   and   has   already   put   her   finger   straight   through   the   fabric   in   two   places ,   and   she   s   not   using   it   as   a   weapon   or   anything   particularly   rought .   it   s   just   a   low   quality   fabric .   ah   well   i   ll   try   to   repair   the   wounds .
rear   facing   a   bit   short   for   1   price   and   safety   are   great .   i   bought   it   for   my   12   month   old   who   now   must   stay   rear   facing   until   he   is   two .   his   feet   are   altready   touching   the   back   of   the   seat .   he   may   have   to   cross   his   legs   by   age   2 .
really   good   collection   not   sure   why   amazon   consider   s   this   as   a   toy .   it   asked   me   to   rate   it   as   if   it   is   a   toy .   this   is   bedding   set !   anyways ,   bought   the   whole   vroom   collection   for   my   son .   really   great   product .   has   the   perfect   boy   colors   and   designs .   works   get   with   rest   of   the   collection .
it   worked   great ...   then   this   happened .   videoid   mo33ycml6hepkh9   we   bought   the   supergate   for   our   cat   to   block   him   from   running   around   the   living   room   and   destroying   our   in   progress   jigsaw   puzzles .   i   purchased   the   product   knowing   very   well   that   our   cat   might   be   able   to   clear   the   gate ,   which   he   did .   so   i   ordered   a   second   supergate   to   double   the   height   of   the   cat   prison   .   presented   in   the   video   is   our   little   houdini   clearing   both   supergates   with   ease .   br   br   for   nimble   cats ,   this   product   fails .   it   might   be   fine   for   babies   and   dogs .
love   love   this   gate !   somehow   the   gate   gods   were   smiling   at   me   the   day   i   bought   this   gate .   i   have   5   dogs ,   and   i   can   t   keep   them   out   of   the   dining   area .   the   width   of   the   opening   from   the   dining   area   to   the   family   room   was   130   inches ,   and   this   gate   opens   up   to   144inches .   i   had   to   find   out   this   information   from   the   reviews .... as   amazon   doesn   t   really   post   a   description   about   the   products .. unless   i   m   missing   something .   anyway   love   this   gate !   it   s   cute   and   keeps   out   my   5   beasts !
better   than   what   comes   with   porta   crib   i   highly   recommend   this   mattress   if   you   buy   a   porta   crib   because   the   mattress   that   comes   with   a   porta   crib   is   thin ,   flimsy   and   seems   uncomfortable   and   too   soft   if   you   want   to   prevent   sids   .   i   am   using   the   portacrib   as   a   regular   crib   because   i   have   to   squeeze   two   kids   into   one   room   until   we   sell   our   house ,   so   i   wanted   a   decent   mattress .   babies   r   us   sells   portacrib   sheets   koala   baby   brand   that   fit   it ,   too .
beats   the   boredom   my   2   month   old   cried   the   whole   time   he   was   in   his   car   seat .   we   just   assumed   he   was   uncomfortable .   we   finally   figured   out ,   he   was   bored .   when   he   was   little ,   it   gave   him   something   to   look   at .   now   that   he   s   4   months ,   it   gives   him   something   to   play   with .   love   that   the   adjustable   ends   will   fit   onto   just   about   anything .   several   people   have   asked   where   we   got   it .   br   br   i   m   only   giving   it   4   stars   because   the   piece   that   spins   if   you   pull   the   cord   is   a   little   junky   and   doesn   t   work   well ,   which   is   too   bad ,   because   little   one   is   all   about   spinning   objects .
didn   t   match   our   needs   i   was   swayed   by   the   joovy   caboose   s   sleek   looks   and   narrow   profile   but   now   have   serious   buyer   s   remorse .   unfortuately   the   only   positive   to   come   from   this   purchase   was   the   knowledge   of   what   i   need   in   a   double   stroller   all   features   absent   on   this   model .   first   of   all ,   and   most   importantly ,   neither   the   3   yr   old   nor   the   15   mo   old   are   comfortable   riding   in   this   and   there   is   no   possible   way   either   could   fall   asleep   in   this   stroller .   even   the   front   seat ,   the   more   comfortable   of   the   two ,   does   not   recline   worth   a   darn   which   makes   sense   as   the   back   seat   passenger   would   be   folded   in   half   were   one   to   try   .   i   knew   this   going   into   it ,   however   did   not   apppreciate   the   importance   of   having   two   seats   that   can   accomodate   sleepy   travellers .   the   back   seat   slides   around   constantly .   there   must   be   a   way   to   keep   this   still   but   i   ve   tried   every   configuration   of   the   2   snaps   that   are   presumably   there   to   to   this   and   nothing   has   worked .   i   spend   80   of   my   time   re   adjusting   big   sister   s   seat .   the   back   passenger   s   feet   will   end   up   getting   twisted   underneath   the   stroller   at   some   point .   i   have   a   child   in   the   10th   percentile   for   height   and   weight   and   even   she   cannot   avoid   this   happening .   for   being   un   ultralight   this   feels   remarkably   heavy   and   awkward .   you   will   end   up   making   a   spectacle   of   yourself   trying   to   navigate   this   stroller   in   tight   spaces   ie   the   pediatrician   s   waiting   room   .   prepare   to   be   humiliated .   the   footrest   of   the   front   seat   routinely   gets   stuck   in   the   upright   position .   now   that   little   sister   is   not   so   little   this   is   a   big   pain .   i   have   had   to   stifle   many   an   f   bomb   during   the   process   of   folding   and   unfolding   this   stroller .   fortunately   we   have   a   vehicle   large   enough   to   haul   it   whole   if   when   i   just   can   t   make   it   collapse .   this   happens   more   often   than   it   should .   i   barely   take   it   out   anymore   because   it   s   just   not   worth   the   trouble .   all   in   all ,   this   bargain   of   a   double   stroller   cost   me   plenty   since   i   now   have   to   replace   it   withsomething   more   appropriate   for   our   needs .   it   looks   great   in   our   basement ,   though .   that   sage   green   really   livens   up   the   otherwise   dreary   decor .
very   handy   device   i   used   one   of   these   when   my   son   was   little   and   loved   it ... so   i   found   this   one   for   my   grandson ... all   i   can   say   is   love   it   love   it   love   it ...
best   nursing   pad   ever   i   decided   to   go   with   washable   pads   since   i   didn   t   like   the   disposable   one .   i   first   tried   the   one   by   philips   avent   but   my   shirts   were   always   wet   and   i   had   to   change   pads   many   times   a   day .   then   after   a   few   research   on   the   web   i   found   that   the   fuzzi   had   great   reviews   and   customers   were   satisfied   with   it .   so   i   bought   them   and   as   the   other   customers ,   i   m   very   pleased   with   it .   they   are   large   might   be   too   large   for   a   small   breast   and   absorb   everything .   i   don   t   need   to   change   them   many   times   a   day .   now   only   once   a   day   and   even   for   2days   is   more   then   enough .   they   are   washable   and   i   even   put   them   in   the   drier .   these   are   the   best   nursing   pad   i   have   tried   and   i   m   very   satisfied   with   it !
love   this   item   although   this   item   is   bulky ,   my   husband   says   that   he   can   knock   people   down   with   it ,   lol ,   this   item   holds   a   carseat .   it   makes   the   carseat   easy   to   transport   when   traveling   through   an   airport .   you   will   get   strange   looks   but   oh   well   at   least   your   child   is   safe .
very   nice   the   shade   of   grey   is   very   delicate ,   and   the   fabric   is   nice   and   soft .   i   haven   t   used   it   yet .   been   too   warm   outside ,   but   this   will   be   great   for   fall   and   spring .   i   will   use   a   down   bag   for   the   winter .   yes ,   i   live   in   the   north   where   it   gets   very   cold  
a   must   have   for   working   nursing   moms   this   is   an   great   product .   it   was   comfortable   and   easy   to   use   and   allowed   me   to   pump   at   work   while   still   getting   things   done   on   my   computer .   a   must   have   for   working   nursing   moms !
very   nice   starter   set ,   but   beware   of   picky   babies   this   is   a   really   nice   starter   set   for   someone   who   plans   to   bottlefeed .   the   bottles   are   well   made   and   bpa   free ,   and   they   don   t   leak .   you   also   get   a   very   nice   brush   very   soft ,   so   it   doesn   t   scratch   the   plastic   ,   a   snack   formula   powder   cup ,   a   handle   and   top   to   transform   the   bottles   into   sippy   cups   later ,   and   a   pacifier .   with   their   wide   mouths ,   these   bottles   are   easy   to   wash ,   and   i   also   think   a   wider   nipple   helps   prevent   nipple   confusion   in   breast   fed   babies .   this   is   just   anecdotal ,   but   it   s   held   true   for   me   with   my   kids .   i   wasn   t   wild   about   the   pacifier ,   as   it   was   a   bit   too   heavy   for   my   daughter   to   easily   keep   in   her   mouth   she   seems   to   like   the   asin   b0037uzur8   mam   start   orthodontic   silicone   pacifier   best .   then   again ,   she   s   only   4   1   2   weeks   old ,   so   the   same   may   not   be   true   of   an   older   baby !   br   br   however ,   i   generally   recommend   that   at   least   for   babies   who   are   breastfeeding   ,   you   buy   just   one   bottle   at   a   time   and   see   how   your   baby   likes   it ,   and   then   buy   a   set   later   if   your   baby   is   amenable ,   because   two   of   my   three   have   been   very   particular   about   what   kind   of   bottles   they   ll   take .   my   daughter   who   has   just   started   using   a   bottle   doesn   t   seem   wild   about   the   avent   bottles .   she   seems   to   much   prefer   the   asin   b001q64at4   playtex   drop   ins   .   i   don   t   know   if   she   prefers   the   playtex   nipple   it   wasn   t   interchangeable   with   the   avent   bottles   or   if   she   prefers   something   about   the   drop   in   liner .   br   br   incidentally ,   if   you   have   a   non   avent   breast   pump   like   the   asin   b004hwxcjs   medela   pump   in   style   and   store   your   milk   in   bottles ,   you   ll   have   to   pump   into   a   different ,   narrow   bottle   and   then   transfer   the   milk   into   these   bottles ,   or   else   purchase   an   adapter ,   like   the   asin   b00005bxey   philips   avent   standard   breast   pump   conversion   kit   .
not   impressed   i   thought   this   was   a   great   idea   and   was   glad   to   find   an   alternative   to   a   200   dollar   car   seat   stroller   device .   however ,   this   was   quite   a   disappointment .   it   was   pretty   unstable   even   though   i   tightened   it   as   far   as   it   would   go .   it   also   broke   my   suitcase .   it   wasn   t   a   cheap   suitcase   either   but   it   broke   the   wheels   off   anyway .   i   ended   up   having   to   drag   my   daughter   and   suitcase   around   the   airport   on   the   last   leg   of   our   16   hour   trip .   i   was   traveling   alone   so   it   sucked   big   time .
alarming !   i   just   received   the   unit ,   and   can   t   speak   to   the   long   term   reliabiltiy ,   but   i   am   most   impressed   with   the   quality   of   the   video ,   audo ,   range   and   features .   its   two   way   communication   allow   the   parent   to   remotely   turn   on   different   functions   in   the   camera .. like   music ,   night   light .   the   one   feature   that   had   me   going   was   a   rotary   switch   on   the   camera   which   sets   the   sensitivity   for   an   alarm   in   the   monitor   whenever   the   sound   threshold   in   the   baby   s   room   is   exceeded .   it   was   set   for   maximum   sensitivity   and   the   alarm   was   reporting   continuously .   took   me   a   while   to   find   out   what   the   cause   was .   a   couple   downsides   to   the   system ..   if   the   noise   threshold   sensitivity   level   is   set   high   so   you   can   hear   a   pin   drop   in   the   baby   s   room ,   the   the   alarm   will   go   off   when   you   remotely   switch   on   the   music .   also ,   the   camera   has   a   room   temperature   monitor ,   but   it   is   mounted   so   close   to   the   camera ,   that   it   reflects   more   the   camera   temp   than   the   room   s .   so   it   reads   about   10   degrees   warmer   on   the   monitor   and   is   virtually   useless .   not   a   deal   breaker   though   .   overall   it   seems   like   a   great   system ..
great   purchase !   i   just   bought   this   monitor   and   i   love   it .   the   quality   of   the   night   vision   is   excellent .   all   of   the   options   are   great .   the   audio   is   overall   good .   dont   hesitate !
what   suction   i   bought   this   plate   so   that   i   could   put   messier   food   in   front   of   my   10   month   old   that   she   could   feed   herself .   the   plate   arrived   and   was   very   cute ,   but   even   out   of   the   box   the   suction   ring   was   not   attached   well .   i   hand   washed   both   pieces   and   put   it   back   together   and   it   does   not   suction   to   anything .   i   made   sure   that   the   ring   was   in   the   grooves   on   the   plate   as   another   reviewer   mentioned ,   but   still   nothing .   i   push   the   plate   down   and   i   can   hear   the   air   getting   and   voiding   the   suction .   so ,   if   you   are   looking   for   a   plate   that   will   actually   suction   and   stick ,   keep   looking   and   let   me   know   when   you   find   it .   i   will   keep   the   plate   because   it   is   cute   and   she   can   use   when   she   is   older   and   will   not   try   to   pick   it   up .   but   it   is   basically   useless   for   the   intended   purpose .
mine   could   not   self   feed   till   i   switched   to   gerber   graduates   metal   utensils   these   were   a   fail .   if   you   want   your   child   to   be   a   success   with   utensils ,   definitely   look   into   the   gerber   graduates   instead .
absolutely   gorgeous   the   blankets   are   super   cute .   i   got   the   ecru   color   scheme   there   are   several   pattern   choices   and   they   are   all   adorable .   the   blankets   are   soft   to   the   touch ,   not   too   thin   but   also   not   thick   and   rigid .   i   haven   t   used   them   yet   due   in   a   few   weeks   but   already   washed   them .   they   kept   their   shape   very   well   after   one   wash   dry   cycle   i   will   update   if   they   loose   the   shape   later   on   as   opposed   to   the   just   born   flannel   receiving   blankets   which   i   also   purchased   at   the   same   time .   in   retrospect ,   i   wish   i   just   got   two   sets   of   the   carter   s   blankets .   five   months   later   my   baby   is   4   months   now   and   those   blankets   are   our   favorite .   they   still   look   very   cute   even   though   the   colors   faded   just   a   bit .   they   keep   the   shape   nicely   though .   i   use   those   mostly   to   cover   my   son   on   days   when   it   s   warm   in   the   house   they   are   perfect   to   keep   him   warm   but   not   hot .   i   also   use   them   to   cover   him   during   night   feedings .   my   mom   usually   places   this   blanket   under   the   baby   when   she   rocks   him   to   sleep .   she   puts   him   down   in   his   crib   with   the   blanket   so   that   the   blanket   touches   the   cold   sheets   of   the   crib .   this   minimizes   the   chance   of   him   waking   up .
a   true   one   size   i   truly   wish   i   had   these   diapers   when   my   daughter   was   born   to   see   if   they   really   live   up   to   a   one   size   reputation .   as   it   is ,   i   first   got   them   when   she   was   11lbs   and   i   m   happy   to   say   i   was   extremely   happy   with   the   fit   and   the   different   adjustments   available   to   the   fit   .   the   inserts   were   a   little   daunting   but   they   are   very   intuitive   snap   smallest   setting   with   most   padding   in   the   middle   for   a   girl .   i   then   decided   to   try   the   diapers   on   my   just   turned   2   year   old   who   needs   the   rise   of   a   large   diaper   and   is   a   heavy   wetter .   i   snapped   in   both   inserts   and   the   mini   pad   to   give   maximum   up   front   absorbancy .   i   didn   t   hold   out   much   hope   of   a   leak   free   experience   as   the   inserts   are   so   thin .   4   hours   later   i   removed   the   wet   diaper   and   everything   outside   of   the   diaper   was   dry .   i   was   amazed   as   i   had   only   washed   the   diaper   once   and   the   bamboo   was   no   where   near   maximum   absorbancy .   it   fits   nice   and   trim   and   i   love   the   fluffy   soft   outer   fabric .   i   like   the   flexibility   of   adjusting   the   inserts   to   suit   both   an   infant   and   a   toddler .   i   also   like   that   you   can   use   the   outer   shell   as   a   cover   or   just   snap   in   a   fresh   liner   if   the   shell   is   still   dry .   i   will   be   buying   the   extra   insert   sets   that   are   sold   separately .   my   one   wish   was   for   this   diaper   to   be   not   suedecloth   i   had   really   bad   experiences   with   bg3   suedecloth   and   ds   had   bad   reactions   to   it   .   i   have   had   no   such   experience   with   this   diaper   so   i   can   only   assume   the   suedecloth   is   different .
drrescu   pros   easy   to   assemble   well   made   product   safe ,   will   not   tip   looks   good   real   item   is   the   same   as   in   the   photos   cons   my   son   just   didn   t   like   this   product   as   much   as   i   thought   he   should .   he   ll   entertain   himself   for   about   15   minutes ,   then   gets   bored .   he   likes   to   grab   at   the   hanging   toys   from   the   leaves .   maybe   he   doesn   t   find   the   toys   very   interactive .
beware   allows   for   easy   dumping   of   liquid   the   quality   of   the   spouts   is   great ,   but   i   was   unaware   that   when   using   these   spouts   the   child   can   dump   an   entire   cup   of   milk   by   simply   turning   the   cup   upside   down .   the   liquid   just   pours   out   of   the   spout .   i   guess   i   didnt   read   the   description   well   enough   to   understand   this   before   i   purchased   them .
what   a   potty !   bought   this   travel   potty   to   keep   in   the   car   for   the   kids   and   it   s   perfect !   fits   compactly   under   the   driver   s   seat .   my   3   and   4   year   old   boys   love   to   use   it .   love   that   it   uses   gallon   sized   bags .   the   two   storage   compartments   are   a   bit   tough   to   snap   open   at   times ,   but   maybe   because   our   potty   is   still   somewhat   new .   compartments   are   great   storage   for   extra   bags ,   wipes ,   and   spare   undies .   i   also   keep   a   few   nursing   pads   in   there .   i   found   that   if   i   put   one   at   the   bottom   of   the   bag   before   the   boys   use   the   potty ,   it   helps   soak   of   some   of   the   liquid   for   less   sloshy   disposal .   would   recommend !
works   great   this   extension   kit   makes   your   playyard   bigger   and   better !   our   child   has   more   room   to   play   without   feeling   as   much   confined .
pretty   and   perfect   i   love   how   easy   it   is   and   how   attractive   it   is .   i   use   it   outside   under   our   covered   veranda .   it   matches   our   iron   railing   so   well !   it   s   a   great   safety   feature   that   looks   like   it   just   fits   in   perfectly ! ! !   great
helpful   for   breast   feeding   everyone   had   recommend   a   breast   feeding   pillow   for   me   when   my   daughter   was   born .   now   she   is   a   month   and   a   half   old ,   i   figure   i   can   review   this   product .   the   boppy   is   probably   the   most   popular   breast   feeding   pillow ,   so   i   figured   i   couldn   t   go   wrong .   i   bought   it   off   amazon ,   because   they   are   so   much   more   expensive   in   stores   so   amazon   does   give   you   a   better   deal .   br   the   boppy   is   great   if   you   are   sitting   in   a   chair .   it   doesn   t   work   as   great   if   you   are   in   bed .   i   found   that   i   can   just   use   a   regular   pillow   if   i   am   feeding   in   bed .   however ,   sitting   on   the   couch ,   or   in   a   rocker   it   works   great .   i   personally   find   that   the   football   feeding   position   works   great   for   the   boppy ,   especially   if   you   have   larger   breasts .   i   don   t   wrap   it   around   the   front   of   me ,   it   goes   more   on   the   side .   when   i   am   in   the   rocker   and   i   use   this ,   i   don   t   need   to   use   blankets   or   anything   under   her   head .   it   is   even   better   in   the   middle   of   the   night   and   i   am   half   asleep   feeding   her .   she   snuggles   right   in .   br   my   fiance   likes   to   use   it   too   when   he   is   holding   her   during   the   day .   he   can   use   it   as   support   to   help   hold   her   so   he   can   do   other   stuff   like   work   on   the   computer .   i   also   have   used   the   boppy   as   support   for   her   during   tummy   time   exercises .   she   liked   to   rest   her   chest   on   it .   lastly   i   used   it   as   support   for   her   to   sit   up   on .   it   can   be   scrunched   up   to   make   the   hole   in   the   middle   smaller   so   she   doesn   t   slip   down .   br   over   all ,   i   happy   with   the   boppy ,   i   would   recommend   it ,   and   i   think   that   our   baby   girl   enjoys   it   too  
must   knows   of   these   bottles ...   my   baby   was   exclusively   breast   fed   for   5   months ,   at   two   months   we   tried   these   to   make   things   more   convenient   for   me   once   in   a   while   but   she   would   barely   take   them .   she   also   wouldn   t   take   a   paci   as   well   so   we   figured   we   d   just   have   to   wait   on   the   bottle   thing .   in   a   crunch ,   my   sister   in   law   gave   my   husband   a   plain   lil   bottle   they   had   gotten   from   nic   u   and   she   took   it   very   well .   i   m   adding   all   that   in   case   any   other   breast   feeding   moms   are   having   the   same   problems .   anyhow ,   after   5   months ,   i   tried   these   again   and   she   had   no   problems .   she   had   severe   reflux ,   so   we   started   with   these ,   if   your   baby   does   not ,   i   would   suggest   getting   the   regular   tommee   tippee   bottles ,   now   that   she   is   almost   7   months   we   have   switched   to   the   regular   fast   flow   nipple   and   bought   regular   rings   to   convert   these   to   use   without   the   long   vent .   the   secret   to   keeping   the   nipple   from   collapsing   yes   it   is   a   little   annoying   to   take   this   extra   step   but   it   works   for   me   every   time   after   preparing   the   bottle   formula   or   breast   milk   is   all   mixed   and   ready   to   feed   ,   open   the   bottle   back   up   and   squeeze   the   little   silicone   valve   bubble   at   the   bottom   of   the   cone   this   is   where   the   slit   that   allows   air   to   escape   is   ,   close   it   up   and   its   ready   to   go ! !   i   guess   they   seal   up   really   easy   and   i   ve   tried   this   every   other   way   and   it   only   works   when   done   right   before   feeding .   because   of   this ,   this   bottle   is   a   deal   breaker   for   most   daddies ,   i   always   fixed   it   for   my   husband   because   he   can   be   a   bigger   baby   than   my   daughter   fyi ,   the   regular   bottles   are   the   same   in   their   own   way   the   way   to   fix   those   is   easier   and   less   messy   because   the   air   spout   is   on   the   nipple   top   so   you   can   squeeze   it   without   opening   the   bottle .   i   don   t   believe   any   bottle   is   perfect ,   we   already   invested   in   these   and   i   love   everything   else   about   these   bottles ...   the   small   problem   with   the   vent   is   really   an   easy   fix ,   so   i   would   buy   them   again .   hope   this   helps  
deceived ...   i   was   very   interested   in   this   item ,   and   ordered   2 .   today ,   when   i   got   them ,   they   did   not   have   the   on   off   switch ,   they   were   just   2   plain   usb   2gb   sticks .   i   was   very   disappointed .
the   best   thing   i   bought   for   baby !   this   glider   was   worth   the   investment !   so   comfy   and   soothes   baby !   probably   the   best   thing   i   bought   for   baby !   must   have !
love   this   for   grandma   s   house   i   bought   this   to   have   a   changing   table   at   my   house .   i   love   it   will   convert   to   a   desk   as   my   grandchildren   grow .   sturdy   yet   not   too   large .
does   the   job   but   not   very   durable   love   this   potty   watch .   after   the   initial   learning   to   use   the   potty   my   son   got   bored   with   it ,   and   regressed ,   waiting   to   go   until   he   d   wet   his   pants   just   a   bit   each   time .   the   potty   watch   totally   changed   that ,   i   set   it   for   the   longest   setting   90   minutes ,   wish   it   had   a   2   hour   setting   and   he   d   go   when   it   went   off .   no   more   wet   underpants   and   no   arguing ,   since   i   didn   t   ask   him   to   to   go ,   the   watch   did !   i   can   t   give   it   5   stars   because   of   the   product   quality .   we   are   on   our   3rd   potty   watch .   the   manufacturers   know   this   is   a   watch   toddlers   preschoolers   will   wear   all   day ...   will   wear   to   the   potty ...   and   therefore   be   washing   their   hands .   it   is   really   not   the   least   bit   water   proof ,   it   s   barely   water   resistant .   i   think   because   of   the   way   it   s   disassembled   to   change   the   batteries ,   the   water   gets   right   into   the   little   computer   board   if   the   kids   really   get   any   water   on   it   at   all .   this   at   best   will   make   it   only   light   up   and   no   longer   play   music ,   at   worst ,   it   will   stop   working   entirely .   big   design   flaw !
great   product   i   love   this   potty   seat .   i   can   t   even   begin   to   tell   you   how   great   it   is .   it   s   made   out   of   sturdy   plastic   that   seems   as   if   it   will   last   a   long   time .   it   fits   snugly   in   on   the   toilet   with   no   problems .   the   adjusting   mechanism   is   genius .   it   s   super   easy   to   clean   and   i   don   t   have   to   worry   about   the   seat   absorbing   any   bathroom   nastiness .   it   comes   off   the   toilet   quickly   and   easily   for   adult   users   and   the   handle   allows   for   easy   hanging .   my   son   loves   sitting   on   it   and   hasn   t   looked   or   acted   uncomfortable   during   use .   he   has   great   confidence   sitting   on   this   seat .   the   splash   guard   isn   t   too   short   or   too   high   and   the   hole   is   just   the   right   size   for   my   potty   training   toddler .   we   haven   t   had   any   issues   as   of   yet   and   i   am   thrilled   to   own   this .   we   tried   self   standing   potty   chairs   as   well   as   the   seats   that   attach   to   the   toilet .   this   is   by   far   my   favorite .
best   thing   so   far   this   chair   added   significantly   to   the   pleasures   of   having   a   baby .   by   having   them   right   up   to   the   table   they   feel   so   much   more   like   a   part   of   the   family .   of   course   this   evolves   into   a   real   hands   on   approach   to   meals   and   has   been   good   for   my   diet   because   i   am   fully   engaged   feeding   the   baby   instead   of   myself .   it   has   also   helped   with   babies   schedule   becasue   he   is   eating   when   we   eat .   a   high   chair   has   some   of   the   same   benefits   but   can   also   segregate   the   child   unintensionally .   some   velcro   on   shields   would   be   a   nice   addition   to   this   item .   we   have   limited   space   in   a   small   apartment   and   not   having   a   high   chair   is   a   real   benefit .   this   chair   is   sturdy   and   srong   if   installed   properly .   the   chair   s   swivel   feature   is   great   because   you   have   clearer   shot   at   the   babies   mouth   on   their   swiveling   head .   the   only   draw   back   is   the   mess   that   builds   up   on   the   padding   between   the   eater   and   feeder .   we   solved   this   by   draping   a   receiving   blanket   over   the   pad   during   feeding   and   washing   it   as   needed .   would   i   buy   it   again   you   bet   i   would .
i   got   this   at   walmart   for   75.00   awesome   set !   i   got   this   set   at   walmart   for   under   100 ...   great   buy .   i   would   def .   recommend .   looks   beautiful   in   the   room   for   my   little   girl !
looks   great   in   our   nursery .   very   cute   and   matches   with   the   rest   of   the   laguna   theme .   light   is   slightly   dim   but   enough   to   see   what   you   are   doing .   a   baby   s   room   doesn   t   need   to   be   brighter .   i   m   very   happy   with   this   purchase .
great   addition   to   the   pac   n   play   this   mattress   makes   such   a   difference   in   the   continued   usability   of   the   pac   n   play .   at   23   pounds ,   my   granddaughter   no   longer   seemed   comfortable   sleeping   on   the   original   thin   mattress   that   comes   with   the   playard   even   though   i   had   put   a   quilted   pad   on   it .   this   mattress   fits   perfectly ,   tightly   enough   to   not   invite   little   fingers   but   easy   enough   to   take   in   and   out   to   change   the   sheet   or   if   you   want   to   use   the   pac   n   play   as   a   playpen .   a   good   price   for   a   really   good   product .
great   got   these   as   replacements .   they   say   to   replace   them   every   3   months   or   so .   sounds   good   to   me .   best   deal   i   found .   these   work   on   all   3   types   of   avent   pumps ,   i   have   the   manual ,   the   uno   and   the   duo .
just   what   i   expected .   this   is   a   great   concept ,   but   as   others   have   stated   beware   of   bananas .   my   son   loved   bananas ,   so   i   just   bought   a   bunch   of   the   extra   nets   because   they   do   get   ruined   after   putting   bananas   in   there .   my   baby   especially   liked   when   i   put   frozen   fruits   in   there   for   him !
great   for   an   umbrella   stroller   for   what   it   is ,   it   s   great .   better   than   any   other   umbrella   stroller   out   there .   my   only   big   problems   with   it   are   that   the   handles   are   a   bit   wobbly   and   my   feet   do   sometimes   hit   the   wheels .   i   am   not   a   fan   of   that   at   all .   my   main   reason   for   buying   this   was   the   height ,   it   s   actually   taller   than   my   full   size   stroller ,   so   i   don   t   have   to   be   bent   so   far   over   when   pushing ,   but   i   do   still   have   to   lean   a   bit .   i   had   no   problems   with   my   son   fitting   in   the   stroller   and   he   is   a   pretty   big   boy .   tall   and   a   bit   chubby ,   but   he   had   no   problem   fitting   in   the   stoller   at   all .   the   straps   adjust   so   he   will   definitely   fit   in   this   thing   for   a   while ,   which   is   awesome .   i   just   wish   there   weren   t   so   much   wobble   in   the   handles   and   i   didn   t   step   on   the   wheels .
hit   or   miss   with   having   them   go   on   perfectly   notes   on   the   room   i   put   these   up   in   my   nursery .   my   wall   was   clean ,   and   the   light   yellow   paint   was   done   over   a   year   ago .   works   well   with   a   pond   theme !   br   br   some   of   these   are   a   bit   close   together ,   so   cutting   them   with   enough   space   to   be   able   to   hold   them   to   the   wall   tightly   can   be   a   bit   tricky .   the   directions   say   press   firmly   ,   what   they   mean   is   press   and   scrape   as   hard   as   you   can   without   breaking   the   tongue   presser   stick   on   the   wall   .   you   arm   gets   pretty   tired   after   only   two   dragonflies .   br   br   i   didn   t   have   any   troubles   with   air   bubbles   like   the   directions   warned ,   but   i   did   have   troubles   with   the   tiny   dragonflies .   the   smaller   the   dragonfly ,   the   harder   it   is   to   get   the   adhesive   to   stick .   the   instructions   warn   you   that   tiny   pieces   and   edges   like   the   antennae   or   tip   of   the   tail   can   be   troublesome .   i   find   that   if   you   can   get   all   the   edges   stuck   down ,   the   middle   shouldn   t   be   a   problem .   if   you   peel   some   off ,   and   it   doesn   t   stick ,   only   about   50   of   the   time   will   putting   it   back   down   and   re   scraping   work .   br   br   honestly ,   on   some   of   the   harder   dragonflies ,   the   adhesive   won   t   entirely   work .   you   just   have   to   say   screw   it   after   working   on   one   dragonfly   for   10   minutes ,   and   tear   it   off   the   wall .   the   body ,   tail ,   and   most   of   the   wings   will   stick .   everything   else   is   a   maybe .   the   instructions   say   you   can   fix   it   up   with   paint ,   which   is   true   but   it   s   a   pain .   br   br   i   do   love   the   colors ,   design ,   and   ability   to   put   them   anywhere .   but   next   time   i   ll   try   other   things   first   before   i   go   back   to   these .
a   little   disappointed !   my   daughter   would   only   take   mam   binkies   and   mam   bottles   so   i   decided   to   go   with   a   mam   sippy   cup   too !   i   not   only   got   a   blue   cup ,   but   they   spill   everywhere !   we   ended   up   using   nuby   sippy   cups ,   my   daughter   took   right   to   them   and   they   never   leak !
not   for   active   infants   my   7   months   gets   too   active   during   bathtime   so   i   bought   this   to   replace   my   asin   b0018z8cn8   fisher   price   precious   planet   whale   of   a   tub   .   it   is   bigger   which   is   great   but   it   is   also   very   slippery   for   an   active   infant .   my   infant   would   crawl   or   tried   to   stand   up   causing   her   to   slipped   hitting   her   body   and   head   into   the   safety   supports   which   are   hard   plastic   mounds .   bathing   became   difficult   and   painful   for   her   so   i   stopped   using   it   and   got   something   with   a   flat   even   surface   like   a   asin   b00361b2ca   hoppop   bato   bath   tub ,   lime   which   worked   out   quite   nicely .   i   would   only   used   this   if   my   infant   just   lay   during   bath   like   a   newborn   but   she   doesn   t .   i   would   also   recommend   getting   some   anti   slip   stickers   if   you   re   still   going   to   get   this .   will   give   it   another   try   once   she   can   stand   on   her   own .
engaging   my   daughter   is   just   over   three   months   old   and   i   attatch   this   to   her   playmat .   she   loves   to   reach   for   it   and   bat   at   it .   i   enjoy   the   different   colors   and   different   textures .   this   is   an   enjoyable   toy   to   have   for   her .
works   great   this   has   helped   our   6   month   old   3   months   adjusted   sleep   through   the   night .   the   only   bad   thing   about   the   one   we   received   is   it   does   have   a   zipper .   it   is   two   pieces   of   foam   that   goes   into   a   case .   the   foam   pieces   are   not   exactly   the   same   height   so   there   is   a   bump   in   the   middle   when   put   into   the   case .
love   his   little   zebra   would   be   5   stars ,   but   the   black   stripes   are   fading   and   did   after   the   first   time   i   washed   it   ... fits   a   lot   and   keeps   things   cool   and   looks   adorable !
not   good   i   run   an   inhome   daycare   and   have   two   of   these   monitors .   i   have   them   both   plugged   in   in   the   kitchen   but   have   them   across   the   room   from   each   other   because   of   interference .   the   sounds   still   bleeds   into   each   other   so   if   one   kid   is   making   noise   in   one   room ,   i   can   hear   it   in   both   monitors .   drives   me   crazy ,   making   it   hard   to   know   which   kid   is   awake .   i   bought   these   because   of   the   low   price   and   apparently ,   the   quality   reflects   the   cost .   i   will   be   splurging   on   higher   quality   monitors   from   now   on .
used   as   educational   toy   i   purchased   these   blocks   to   make   the   learning   toy   found   on   the   mama   jenn   blog .   ...   ,   click   on   education   cubes   link   basically   you   print   out   her   premade   inserts   of   letters ,   numbers ,   sight   words ,   etc   and   insert   them   into   the   block   instead   of   photos .   i   can   use   these   for   all   kinds   of   learning   games   with   all   three   of   my   homeschooling   children .
broke   in   the   wind   we   bought   this   tent   because   we   were   going   to   florida   and   wanted   to   make   sure   we   had   some   shade   for   our   18   month   old   daughter .   when   we   put   it   together   at   home   to   try   it   out ,   she   loved   going   in   and   out   of   it .   on   the   beach   she   wasn   t   interested   in   going   into   it   at   all .   she   just   wanted   to   play   in   the   sand .   we   thought   she   might   nap   in   it   but   it   was   too   hot   for   that   and   while   we   were   at   the   beach   all   she   wanted   to   do   was   play   so   it   was   best   to   go   back   to   the   room   for   naps .   our   biggest   complaint   is   that   it   is   quite   flimsy   and   broke   in   the   wind .   we   can   still   use   it   but   one   of   the   plastic   poles   is   broken .   to   be   fair ,   i   should   mention   that   it   is   very   easy   to   set   up   and   take   down .   perhaps   it   would   be   more   useful   for   a   younger   baby   and   not   on   windy   days .
okay   if   it   fits   your   toilet   seat   i   would   rate   this   seat   at   5   stars   if   it   would   have   fit   all   the   seats   in   my   house .   luckily ,   the   most   important   seat   we   needed   this   for   it   fits   perfectly .   we   have   twin   girls   and   needed   two .   both   are   made   the   same ,   however   out   of   three   toilets   we   ve   put   these   on ,   only   one   works   with   this   seat .   the   holes   on   the   toilet   seat   are   too   small   for   the   rim   for   the   seat   to   sit   on .   not   sure   why   this   seat   isn   t   universal !
excellent !   i   ve   got   twin   girls   and   they   love   to   potty   on   this   seat .   the   well   is   deep   enough   and   even   girls   need   the   splash   guard   at   times .   this   has   proven   to   be   the   best   seat   we   own .   it   s   sturdy !   it   doesn   t   tip   over !   it   s   tall   enough !   we   actually   use   this   in   our   van   because   i   encourage   the   girls   to   potty   before   we   go   in   somewhere   so   they   aren   t   subjected   to   nasty   public   restrooms .   even   with   driving   it   while   there   s   still   pee   inside   isn   t   a   problem .   it   s   never   tipped   or   spilled !

nice ,   simple   set   for   kids   i   ve   had   this   set   for   6   months   now .   my   3   year   old   seems   to   do   fine   with   it ,   and   it   has   held   up   well .   i   hand   wash   it ,   but   the   bowl   has   been   dropped   tons   of   time   and   has   held   up   great   without   any   dents   or   dings .   the   bowl   does   slide   around   a   bit   versus   the   plastic   bowls   we   have   with   the   rubber   base   ,   but   i   think   that   s   just   a   trade   off .   the   cup   is   light   and   easy   enough   for   my   son   to   hold   and   drink   from .   i   saw   some   comments   that   this   set   is   tiny ,   but   the   small   plate   size   has   worked   for   us .   i   d   actually   rather   give   my   son   two   small   servings   than   pile   on   all   the   food   at   once ,   but   that   s   totally   just   personal   preference .
not   my   favorite   i   ordered   these   based   on   the   rave   reviews ,   but   i   have   to   say   i   am   not   impressed   with   these   liners   compared   to   the   grovia   liners   that   we   used   prior   to   this .   yes ,   these   are   much   softer ,   but   they   are   a   pain   to   pull   out   of   the   box   one   at   a   time ,   then   unfolding   it ,   laying   it   on   a   diaper ,   and   getting   diaper   on   whilst   wrestling   a   baby   is   not   an   easy   feat .   but   the   worst   thing   about   these   liners   is   that   they   stay   so   wet   once   my   baby   wets   her   diaper   the   liner   starts   to   dissolve   and   stick   right   to   her   bum ,   requiring   me   to   peel   it   off   her   skin .   in   the   past   week   since   we   ve   started   using   this   brand ,   her   bottom   has   been   very   red .   coincidence   maybe ,   but   i   m   not   going   to   wait   for   a   full   blown   diaper   rash   to   find   out .   i   m   ordering   the   grovia   liners   again ,   and   maybe   we   ll   experiment   with   another   brand   for   next   time .
save   your   money   do   not   buy   this !   this   bear   was   so   disappointing ! !   we   have   a   bigger   bear   and   love   it .   it   s   stood   up   awesome   to   4   years   of   play   with   no   issues   at   all .   we   had   this   new   bear   less   than   a   month   and   mostly   ignored   and   unplayed   with   the   entire   time   and   one   of   the   paws   has   ripped   where   the   satin   part   meets   the   fur   part   of   the   bear !   it   is   so   incredibly   cheaply   made .   life   has   been   very   crazy   and   busy   and   i   didn   t   realize   the   return   window   is   a   mere   month   long   from   when   the   bear   is   shipped .   i   can   however ,   return   the   cheaply   made   piece   of   junk   for   a   partial   refund ,   and   pay   for   all   the   shipping .   that   would   amount   to   about   the   cost   of   the   bear   in   the   first   place .   terrible   return   policy ! ! !   i   ll   just   sew   the   bear   up   and   not   purchase   another .   don   t   waste   your   money   on   this   bear .   mine   wasn   t   even   washed   yet ,   and   it   s   already   ripped   apart .   i   can   only   imagine   how   well   it   would   withstand   a   washing   or   two .   so   disappointing .
the   perfect   detail   for   baby   s   nursery !   i   love ,   love ,   love   this   for   garland   for   decorating   the   wall   above   my   son   s   crib .   we   didn   t   want   anything   permanent   for   decor   in   our   baby   s   room   because   they   grow   out   of   those   murals   infant   wall   art   so   quickly .   this   is   colorful ,   cheery   and   tasteful .   relatively   inexpensive   too   when   you   consider   how   pricey   decorating   a   room   can   be .   plus ,   we   can   use   this   when   2   comes   along ,   boy   or   girl ,   and   aren   t   locked   into   something   gender   specific !   this   is   contemporary   without   being   super   modern ,   and   goes   well   with   any   color   paint   bedding .
poor   battery   life   i   didn   t   buy   this   product   on   amazon   which   was   okay   b   c   i   returned   it   to   the   store   within   3   days   of   buying   it .   i   m   adding   my   review   b   c   it   s   slightly   different   than   the   others .   i   didn   t   have   a   problem   with   the   quality   of   the   screen ,   etc .   i   had   a   major   problem   with   the   battery   life .   even   when   the   monitor   is   only   on   audio ,   the   battery   drains   fast .   i   need   to   ask   summer   infant   why   they   would   create   a   baby   monitor   that   drains   its   battery   so   fast .   i   woke   up   2   nights   in   a   row   to   find   the   handheld   had   died   and   i   couldn   t   check   on   my   baby .   very   frustrating ...
love   it !   this   is   the   best !   i   had   the   boppy   pillow   but   gave   it   away   and   bought   this   after   trying   it   at   my   dr . s   office   in   comparison   it   is   thicker   and   much   larger   to   really   support   the   baby   while   nursing .   i   would   absolutely   suggest   this   pillow   to   any   first   time   mom !
love   these   binkys !   i   love   these !   they   not   only   come   in   cute   designs   and   colors   but   these   are   the   only   binkys   my   baby   would   ever   take !   i   m   so   thankful   for   them  
great   potty   trainer   i   read   up   on   so   many   types   of   potty   seats   from   free   standing   to   toilet   attachments   and   this   one   works   perfectly   for   our   22   month   old .   we   have   never   had   a   leak   between   the   toilet   seat   nad   attachment   and   he   enjoys   sitting   on   the   extrememly   comfortable   seat   thought   out   the   day .   my   only   mistake   was   not   buying   2   straight   away .
wonderful   this   is   great .   my   daughter   loves   them .   it   is   so   useful .   she   was   able   to   shop   for   5   hours   at   the   mall .   her   daughter   was   so   content .   she   is   only   3   weeks   old .   i   would   highly   recommend   this .
great   alternative   to   ugly   expensive   bassinets   my   wife   and   i   were   against   buying   a   bassinets   simply   because   it   would   only   be   used   for   a   few   months   then   it   would   just   take   up   space .   not   to   mention   most   bassinets   are   ugly   and   the   only   decent   looking   ones   are   crazy   expensive .   when   we   both   saw   this   play   pen   we   knew   we   found   a   happy   medium .   set   up   was   easy   right   out   of   the   box .   the   instructions   make   things   go   really   fast .   snap   the   arms   up ,   then   push   down   on   the   middle .   the   stages   pad   has   slots   that   metal   bars   slide   through .   these   metal   bars   snap   into   the   top   corners   of   the   crib .   it   is   light   and   easy   to   move   around .   it   is   about   2ft   wide   by   3ft   long   and   this   fit   perfectly   in   our   bedroom   without   getting   in   the   way .   i   really   like   the   fact   that   we   will   be   able   to   use   this   play   pen   for   many   years   to   come .   it   compact   enough   that   we   can   take   it   anywhere   with   worrying   about   space .   it   s   big   enough   that   i   think   even   an   18month   old   could   use   it   as   a   play   pen   with   out   feeling   claustophobic .   i   would   highly   recommend   this   play   pen   bassinet   to   any   shop   savy   parent   who   wants   their   baby   in   their   room   for   the   first   couple   of   months ,   but   doesn   t   want   to   feel   like   they   re   wasting   money .   let   s   not   forget   the   fact   that   it   is   also   a   play   pen !   bottom   line   great   item   for   a   great   price .
great   purchase   well   worth   the   money   i   m   100   satisfied   with   the   kidco   convertible   crib   bed   rail   i   purchased .   it   was   a   simple   set   up   and   has   been   durable   and   reliable .   i   was   looking   for   something   that   would   keep   my   2   year   old   from   rolling   out   of   bed   but   wanting   a   rail   that   wasn   t   as   large ,   tall   and   bulky   as   the   other   bed   rails   i   was   seeing   everywhere .   the   height   is   exactly   what   i   wanted   and   it   is   of   good   quality .   i   am   so   pleased   i   found   this   on   amazon ,   its   been   a   great   purchase !   thanks   kidco   for   making   a   common   sense ,   good   quality   product !  
not   worth   it   after   reading   many   good   reviews ,   we   registered   for   and   received   this   product   while   expecting   our   first   child .   after   she   was   born ,   however ,   it   became   apparent   that   it   was   a   waste   of   money .   she   slid   down   the   hammock   constantly   so   we   had   to   hold   her   up   and   keep   her   from   having   her   head   submerged ,   meanwhile ,   the   hammock   kept   most   of   her   body   out   of   the   water   so   she   was   cold .   perhaps   some   parents   might   be   drawn   to   it   because   it   will   last   them   until   their   children   are   toddlers .   good   luck   keeping   a   toddler   in   this   thing !   perhaps   if   you   have   a   shower   only ... but   i   think   a   bucket   or   deep   try   would   work   just   as   well   and   be   a   lot   cheaper .   after   two   or   three   baths   i   gave   it   away   to   a   friend   who   was   expecting   and   wanted   to   give   it   a   try .   we   ended   up   using   a   towel   on   the   bottom   of   the   bathtub   as   a   cushion   until   our   daughter   was   old   enough   to   sit   up   in   the   tub .   when   our   second   daughter   was   born   we   purchased   a   6   infant   bath   sponge .   it   keeps   her   comfy ,   warm ,   and   she   loves   it   and   it   dries   a   heck   of   a   lot   faster   than   the   towel   ever   did   .   skip   this   item   all   together .
thin   fabric ,   dull   colors   i   returned   this   product   because ,   like   another   reviewer   said ,   the   colors   were   not   as   vibrant   as   the   picture   particularly   the   orange   and   the   fabric   was   very   thin .
good   fit   this   was   the   only   pacifier   that   was   the   right   size   for   our   newborn .   she   seemed   to   gag   on   the   others   once   in   a   while   they   were   to   big   even   though   were   size   0 .   good   shape   and   fit   and   very   cute   designs .
love   wubbanubs !   i   love   wubbanubs   and   so   does   my   baby !   the   soothie   style   pacifier   is   the   only   one   he   will   take ,   but   they   are   hard   to   keep   in .   i   like   having   the   stuffed   animal   attached   as   it   helps   keep   it   in   and   makes   the   binky   harder   to   lose .
lion   love !   love ,   love ,   love   this   lion   wubbanub .   it   is   so   cute   and   the   satin   mane   and   satin   tip   on   the   tail   are   perfect   for   rubbing .   we   have   already   had   the   duck ,   frog   and   elephant   and   this   is   a   welcome   edition .  
does   what   it   promises   our   son   received   his   first   red   dog   wubbanub   paci   while   in   the   nicu   and   after   he   was   released   later   i   soo   understood   why   the   nurses   loved   these   pacifiers .   my   son   who   just   turned   4   months   old   is   not   a   great   paci   sucker   even   though   he   likes   to   fall   asleep   with   it ,   but   his   wubbanub   helps   him   by   staying   in   place !   i   just   love   that   they   are   very   easy   to   find ... havent   lost   one   yet ! .. and   he   has   three !
great   pacifier   my   wife   bought   this   for   her   godson ,   and   he   loves   it .   it   was   smaller   than   she   had   pictured ,   but   ended   up   being   the   perfect   size   for   him .   talking   about   size ,   the   monkey   is   the   size   of   beenie   baby .   she   said   the   only   thing   she   didn   t   like   was   that   the   actual   pacifier   can   t   come   off   to   be   cleaned .   her   friend   bought   pacifier   wipes   to   clean   it .
fantastic   and   safe !   love   knowing   that   it   s   all   one   piece .   my   baby   really   likes   this   pacifier .   we   tried   several   different   kinds ,   but   she   only   wanted   this   one .
nice   pacifier   holder   i   love   this .   2   pacis   can   fit   in   this   pod .   i   love   that   it   matches   my   jj   cole   diaper   wipes   pod ,   and   my   diaper   bag .   the   material   it   is   made   out   of   is   so   easy   to   clean ,   and   doesn   t   hold   or   absorb   germs .   i   love   it .   it   is   a   perfect   baby   shower   gift .
love   the   mams !   pros   mam   binkies   really   are   the   best   br   1 .   when   your   baby   gets   to   be   old   enough   to   bring   things   to   his   her   mouth ,   these   binkies   are   very   easy   to   get   in !   there   s   no   upside   down   like   there   is   with   most   orthodontic   pacifiers   ,   and   there   s   no   floppy   hook   in   the   way .   br   2 .   they   re   weighted   extraordinarily   well ,   and   when   they   fall   90   of   the   time ,   they   land   without   touching   the   nipple   to   the   ground !   this   is   an   enormously   valuable   feature !   br   br   cons   br   1 .   they   re   a   little   hard   to   come   by ,   so   when   you   find   them ,   you   ve   got   to   stock   up !   i   can   only   find   the   6   mo   size   at   walgreens   and   my   local   grocery   stores .   br   2 .   they   re   more   pricey   than   others .   worth   it ,   tho !   br   3 .   you   can   t   pick   the   colors   when   ordered   from   amazon .   i   lucked   out   and   got   blue   for   my   boy ,   but   i   could   have   received   pink .
will   not   stay   in !   our   2   month   old   loves   to   be   pacified ,   but   this   will   not   stay   in   at   all .   it   pops   out   after   a   few   seconds .   we   switched   to   a   cheapo   type   and   those   work   much   better .   these   are   not   all   they   re   cracked   up   to   be .
not   for   us   we   got   this   because   his   paci   was   falling   out ,   and   he   woke   us   up   every   hour   to   put   it   back   in .   we   couldn   t   figure   out   how   to   get   this   to   stay   in   place   so   he   could   find   the   nipple   on   his   own .   maybe   good   if   you   start   using   it   right   away ,   instead   of   when   they   are   older .
summer   customer   service   sucks   my   video   monitor   froze   up   11   months   after   using   it .   summer   infant   customer   sucks   and   said   they   never   heard   of   that   complaint   before .   after   being   on   hold   for   34   minutes   and   arguing   with   a   rep   for   about   the   same   time ,   they   agreed   to   send   me   a   new   and   improved   monitor .   save   yourself   the   trouble   and   purchase   a   video   monitor   not   from   summer   infant .   their   customer   service   reps   are   cocky   and   are   trained   in   giving   customers   the   run   around .   if   you   are   considering   a   summer   monitor ,   search   around   and   read   the   reviews   appears   that   they   all   begin   to   freeze   up   eventually !   200   worth   of   junk ! ! !
comfy   chair   but   we   received   the   chair   in   good   shape   from   amazon .   it   is   vey   comfortable   but   very   difficult   to   assemble .   the   snap   for   arm   rest   cushion   are   terrible ,   not   fit   each   other   at   all .   my   husband   has   tried   everything   but   still   not   able   to   make   it   fit .   still   don   t   know   what   to   do   with   it .
good   but   jury   still   out   update   since   the   baby   just   started   sleeping   in   the   crib   i   cannot   talk   about   long   term   but   the   mattress   fit   nice   and   snug   in   the   crib   and   is   easy   to   lift   out   to   change   sheets ,   which   fit   nicely   form   the   get   go .   there   is   ample   support   along   the   edges   for   when   the   baby   is   going   to   be   standing   there   and   the   mattress   is   easy   to   clean   any   wetness   or   other   messes   off   should   they   occur .   my   son   seems   very   comfortable   when   lying   on   the   mattress .   i   can   t   comment   on   firmness   for   my   son   since   he   barely   puts   a   dent   in   a   pile   of   cotton   when   on   it   but   the   mattress   seems   nice   and   firm   to   my   test .   i   think   for   the   price   it   is   a   great   bargain .   at   the   very   least   you   will   get   a   few   good   years   while   your   child   is   still   growing   and   putting   on   weight .   i   know   we   want   to   buy   for   the   long   term   but   to   be   honest ,   will   we   really   keep   this   over   3   4   years   from   what   i   have   seen   thus   far ,   looks   like   a   great   product .   br   br   i   am   changing   the   rating   from   a   four   star   to   five   as   the   mattress   has   been   a   perfect   fit   and   must   be   comfortable   as   the   baby   sleeps   endlessly   on   it .   very   happy   with   this   purchase .
good   product   i   pleased   with   this   cute   eco   friendly   placemat .   a   ribbon   was   attached   to   the   mat .   whenever   i   wash ,   it   bother   me ,   so   i   take   it   out .   also ,   i   am   not   sure   about   chalk   pocket ...   it   s   kind   of   on   the   way   when   my   son   eat   meals ...   anyways ,   these   are   little   complains .   all   things   consider ,   i   am   happy   with   it .
awesome !   this   is   the   coolest   night   light   bed   time   lamp !   well   worth   the   .   we   purchased   this   for   our   1   year   old ,   and   by   the   time   night   fall   came   our   11   year   old   daughter   took   it .   not   much   of   a   hands   on   toy   for   the   little   ones ,   but   it   s   defenitaly   a   great   room   deco .   going   to   buy   another   today   for   our   oldest   daughter !
right   battery ,   wrong   connector   the   battery   pack   was   correct ,   but   the   connector   was   wrong   for   the   model   02174   monitor .   i   had   to   cut   it   off   and   replace   it   with   the   connector   from   the   original   battery   pack .   other   than   that   the   battery   takes   a   good   charge   and   lasts   all   day .
my   son   s   favorite   cup   when   i   discovered   that   my   14   mo   old   son   could   drink   from   a   straw ,   a   started   searching   for   a   non   spill   straw   cup .   we   have   tried   many   and   this   is   my   son   s   favorite .   now   16   mo ,   this   is   his   favorite   cup   to   use .   he   feels   like   a   big   boy   and   has   no   difficulty   getting   the   liquid   out .   for   those   that   have   expressed   concern   that   it   is   too   difficult   to   suck ,   i   think   it   just   takes   practice   for   the   little   one   to   get   used   to   it .
cute   baby   toy   my   6   month   old   grandson   loves   this   giraffe ,   whether   he   is   chewing   on   it   or   smacking   it   around   to   make   it   squeak ,   it   s   very   durable   and   soft .
my   favorite   baby   bib   of   all   time !   my   daughter   uses   this   while   she   s   teething   and   when   i   feed   her .   it   s   an   easy   way   to   prevent   getting   things   on   her   clothes ,   since   the   bib   is   quite   large .   the   material   is   so   soft !   and ,   the   designs   are   very   cute .   this   is   a   must   have   item !   i   love   that   you   simply   just   pull   it   over   baby   s   head   and   it   stays   on ,   unlike   other   bibs .   it   makes   it   easy   when   i   clean   up   after   feeding   her   because   all   i   do   is   use   the   bib   to   wipe   her   down   and   nothing   ever   gets   on   her .
just   never   takes   neither   of   my   kids   like   these   pacifiers   despite   my   best   efforts .   it   seems   like   one   of   those   products   parents   like   and   frankly   i   never   see   any   other   babies   with   them   either   despite   many   friends   receiving   them   as   gifts .   i   don   t   know   if   it   s   the   shape   or   the   flavor   of   the   rubber   but   they   really   dislike   them .   otherwise   i   don   t   have   a   problem   with   their   construction   and   such .
really   easy   to   use   our   six   month   old   baby   picked   up   our   older   son   s   cup   and   was   able   to   drink   with   ease   from   the   straw .   the   fun   design   attracts   our   children   and   they   reach   for   the   lollacup   over   our   other   straw   sippy   cups .   the   adorable   design   and   ease   of   use   and   cleaning   make   this   a   wonderful   product .
hideous   scratches   out   of   the   box   i   uploaded   a   picture .   noticed   others   had   similar   problems ,   but   i   hadn   t   noticed   those   pictures   before   i   ordered .   please   do   check   them   out .   probably   not   a   problem   if   you   have   a   sander   and   wood   finish ,   but   then   you   can   probably   make   your   own   out   of   better   quality   wood   this   is   gumwood   .
good   product   asin   b002kar786   nuk   silicone   orthodontic   nipples ,   slow   flow ,   size   1 ,   2   pack   i   feed   my   baby   breast   milk   medela   pumping   and   similac   advance   newborn   ready   to   feed ,   2   fluid   ounces   .   i   was   using   the   disposable   nipple   from   similac   for   the   medela   bottle ,   too ,   but   it   was   too   wasted .   so   i   was   looking   for   a   nipple   fits   to   the   similac   ring   i   m   not   sure   this   is   medela   narrow   or   wide   size   ring .   ,   and   has   slow   flow .   this   nuk   nipple   fits   perfectly   to   the   similac   ring .   i   removed   the   disposable   nipple   from   the   ring   and   inserted   the   nuk   nipple .   perfect !   my   baby   sucks   this   nipple   as   she   sucks   breast   milk .   it   is   definitely   slow   flow .
excellent   product !   babies   spend   a   lot   of   time   on   their   mattresses   for   many   many   years   during   childhood .   consequently ,   we   felt   like   it   was   worthwhile   getting   a   decent   mattress   and   so   purchased   the   moonlight   slumber   starlight   support   mattress   which   is   amazing .   with   a   nice   mattress   a   mattress   cover   is   a   must   as   accidents   happen .   this   is   a   nice   mattress   cover .   it   is   soft   and   fits   snugly .   no   problems   so   far .

fishing   set   for   a   1   year   old   i   did   nt   know   what   to   get   my   grandson   for   his   first   birthday ,   and   i   came   across   this   fishing   set   on   amazon ,   and   i   was   very   pleased ,   when   he   found   this   toy   to   be   his   favorite   among   all   the   toys   he   recieved   at   his   birthday   party !   he   also   takes   it   in   the   house   and   plays   with   it   in   his   bath   tub   time .   he   has   also   learned   the   word   fishie   from   playing   and   understanding   all   the   different   toys .   it   is   safe   for   him   to   play   with   which   is   a   main   concern   of   mine   and   i   recommend   it   for   any   one   year   old ,   and   he   knows   the   concept   of   fishing   for   the   toys   with   the   magnetic   pole .   and   it   is   nice   that   the   magnet   actually   works   with   the   toys   as   well .   the   toys   also   are   squirters   and   he   already   learned   to   do   that !
great   sippy   with   1   flaw   we   have   been   using   these   straw   sippy   cups   now   for   a   few   months   and   have   decided   that   we   like   them .   they   really   are   spill   proof ,   hold   a   lot   of   liquid ,   and   are   easy   for   my   daughter   to   use .   the   only   flaw   is   that   liquid   is   held   in   the   straw   after   my   daughter   finishes   drinking   and   when   she   pulls   the   sippy   from   her   mouth ,   the   straw   tends   to   flick   liquid   back   at   her   face .   so ,   she   gets   hits   with   a   few   drops   of   liquid   after   most   sips .   it   s   annoying   and   tends   to   shock   her   after   each   drink .
perfect   little   high   chair   sturdy   chair   attaches   to   any   table ,   we   even   took   it   to   the   beach   with   us !   seat   cover   wipes   clean   very   easily ,   only   criticism   i   would   have   is   there   were   no   color   choices ... would   have   preferred   something   other   than   red   but   this   is   an   awesome   product   for   the   money !
almost   as   difficult   as   a   bassinet   from   reading   reviews   for   this   product ,   i   had   different   expectations .   there   is   still   a   sizable   lip   on   this   thing .   you   can   t   exactly   have   it   next   to   the   bed   and   draw   your   baby   over   to   you .   especially   when   they   are   a   newborn   and   don   t   have   head   control ,   i   still   had   to   get   up   to   properly   safely   pick   my   daughter   up   to   bring   her   close   for   nursing .   so   i   don   t   find   this   to   be   a   good   alternative   to   co   sleeping .   also ,   at   5   months ,   she   already   pretty   much   outgrown   this .   i   don   t   use   it   for   sleeping ,   but   i   d   let   her   play   it   in   with   the   fourth   side   pulled   up .   she   really   has   only   a   few   inches   to   spare ,   so   i   can   t   even   get   use   out   of   it   like   that .   pros   i   like   the   storage   on   the   bottom   and   this   pattern   tan   dot   is   neutral   and   attractive .
good   idea   but   bad   fit   a   hands   free   bustier   is   a   must   for   any   bfing   mom   who   wants   to   pump   but   i   could   never   get   a   good   fit   from   this   one .   for   a   much   better   fit   try   the   asin   b00295mqlu   simple   wishes   hands   free   breastpump   bra ,   pink ,   xs   s   m   .   it   s   very   adjustable   and   should   allow   for   a   good   fit   for   any   woman .
extension   worked   well   with   the   gate .   the   porch   steps   are   wide   and   the   gate   needed   an   extension .   this   works   fine .   and   looks   decent   too .
can   be   boiled   we   got   one   like   this   in   the   hospital   when   our   baby   was   born .   it   is   nice   to   have   a   simple   one   piece   pacifier .   it   is   very   easy   to   clean   and   withstood   being   boiled .   the   baby   loves   it .
pacifier   and   teether   we   used   these   pacifiers   with   our   daughter   when   she   was   a   newborn .   she   quickly   learned   to   suck   the   soothie   without   nipple   confusion   even   though   she   is   tongue   tied   .   when   she   was   about   1   month   old ,   we   transitioned   her   to   the   nuk   brand   of   pacifier   because   they   are   easier   for   babies   to   keep   in   their   mouths   while   sleeping .   now   that   she   s   4   months   old   and   started   teething   poor   thing !   ,   we   use   the   soothie   as   teethers .   she   can   easily   hold   the   pacifier   and   chew   on   the   nipple   or   the   edges   of   the   pacifier .   she   especially   likes   to   chew   on   this   pacifier   when   we   have   our   finger   inside   the   nipple .   turns   out   that   the   soothies   are   better   teethers   than   the   majority   of   her   teething   toys ...
can   t   drive   with   out   it .   i   bought   this   for   are   son .   its   easy   to   grab   while   in   the   car .   regular   pacifiers   not   attached   to   anything   get   lost   in   the   car   seat .   also   he   holds   on   to   it .   its   something   for   him   to   grip   on   and   soothe   him   at   the   same   time .
natursutten   pacifiers   my   baby   loves   these   pacifiers   and   so   do   i !   they   are   such   high   quality   and   so   good   on   babies   teeth .
it   makes   me   feel   better !   i   always   worry   about   my   son   s   pacifier   being   dirty   when   we   are   out .   at   home ,   we   can   always   wash   it   before   giving   his   pacifier   to   him .   but   it   is   not   always   that   convenient   when   we   are   out .   i   know   a   lot   of   people   do   not   quite   care   about   it   or   think   lightly   of   if   the   pacifier   being   super   clean .   i   am   so   relieved   when   i   found   this   product   what   a   great   idea .   i   also   use   it   to   wipe   my   nipples   before   i   nurse   my   son .   it   makes   me   feel   better   knowing   that   i   clean   the   stuff   that   is   going   to   enter   his   mouth .   he   is   now   3   months   old .   i   plan   to   use   this   to   clean   all   the   toys   that   he   will   be   chewing   on   later .   again ,   toys   can   be   washed   when   we   are   at   home   but   not   easily   when   we   are   out .   this   product   really   comes   in   handy   when   we   are   out .   i   carry   it   in   my   purse   and   in   my   diaper   bag   now .
love   it ! !   i   bought   this   cute   binkibear   for   my   4   m   old   son   and   he   fell   in   love   with   binki   as   soon   as   he   saw   it ! !   he   really   enjoys   cuddling   with   binki   and   plays   with   it .   i   even   found   my   son   rolling   on   the   bed   and   still   holding   it   in   his   arm ! lol   the   only   thing   i   didn   t   satisfy   is   my   son   doesn   t   like   the   pacifier   attached   on   binki ,   but   i   think   it   s   not   a   big   deal ,   i   can   buy   other   pacifier   to   replace   it .
love   this   pacifier   my   daughter   is   a   breastfed   baby   and   i   was   afraid   to   give   her   any   pacifier   at   first .   but   when   the   screaming   constantly   got   to   be   too   much ,   i   decided   to   give   this   one   a   try .   heaven !   she   only   sucks   it   for   brief   periods   until   she   calms   down   and   when   she   s   done ,   she   is   done ,   she   spits   it   out   with   a   disgusted   look   on   her   face   that   is   too   funny .   but   it   has   caused   no   nipple   confusion   and   it   does   what   it   s   intended   purpose   is ,   stopping   the   screaming .   highly   recommend !
like   a   lovey   love   it .   soft   and   adorable .   my   daughter   had   it   when   she   was   small   and   even   at   one   now ,   she   still   uses   it   like   a   lovey .   it   s   easy   for   her   to   find   at   night   when   she   wakes   and   fits   perfectly   in   her   small   hands .   i   buy   it   for   all   my   new   mommy   friends .
my   little   man   loves   this ! !   perfect   for   a   small   baby ... the   stuffed   animal   lays   on   the   baby   and   the   pacifier   is   just   the   right   size   for   his   little   mouth !   we   had   a   monkey   and   had   to   get   a   second   in   case   it   was   lost   b   c   our   baby   loves   it   so   much !
really   huge   nipple   these   pacifiers   are   gigantic .   i   ended   up   not   giving   them   to   my   son   because   they   are   so   much   bigger   from   the   other   pacifiers   he   s   using .   i   just   didn   t   want   him   to   get   used   to   this   one   and   not   use   the   other   ones   i   have   purchased .   since   my   son   never   used   them ,   i   really   can   t   say   how   the   quality   of   these   are .
fun   practical   my   son   loves   this   pacifier !   he   has   been   using   it   since   we   got   it   he   was   8   weeks   .   at   first   he   could   care   less   about   the   dinosaur   attached   and   was   just   interested   in   the   pacifier ,   but   now   he   loves   that   he   can   grab   it   and   move   it   around .   he   doesn   t   have   the   ability   to   put   a   small   pacifier   in   his   mouth   yet ,   but   with   the   dinosaur   he   can   hold   it   much   easier .   i   also   love   it   because   if   you   lay   the   dino   on   him   or   a   surface   with   the   pacifier   in   his   mouth   it   doesn   t   fall   out   so   easily   as   the   pacifier   alone .   a   great   help   for   when   he   wakes   up   when   the   pacifier   falls   out !   overall   we   find   it   so   adorable   and   helpful   it   goes   everywhere   with   us !
love   these !   ever   since   i   bought   my   friend   a   wubbanub   for   her   son ,   i   ve   been   wanting   to   buy   these   for   everybody .   so   far ,   all   the   babies   seem   to   enjoy   them !   i   bought   this   for   my   cousin   and   his   girlfriend   s   baby   boy .   way   too   cute !
not   as   great   at   other   moms   say   it   is   i   thought   this   was   a   good   purchase   until   it   finally   arrived .   i   did   not   like   how   the   soap   and   water   got   stuck   inside   the   pacifier .   not   only   is   it   difficult   to   get   out   and   clean ,   i   feel   that   it   s   unsanitary   to   give   to   a   baby   if   you   don   t   sanitize   it   in   hot   water   after   every   use .   i   sanitized   it   in   hot   water   for   5   10   minutes   before   use   and   my   son   did   not   accept   the   pacifier   at   all   which   i   don   t   mind   because   it   would   be   a   pain   to   sanitize   after   every   use .   the   only   positive   thing   about   the   pacifier   is   the   cover   that   it   comes   with   because   if   it   didn   t   i   would   have   given   it   one   star .
we   love   this ! ! !   this   is   the   best ! !   my   son   is   able   to   take   the   pacifier   in   out   of   his   mouth   on   his   own ,   we   no   longer   lose   pacifiers ,   and   it   is   easy   to   catch   if   it   does   fall   out   or   he   drops   it .   we   give   this   to   our   5   month   old   every   night   and   we   find   him   curled   up   snuggling   with   the   lamb   throughout   the   night .   sometimes   he   will   even   put   it   back   in   on   his   own   in   the   morning   and   go   back   to   sleep   for   a   bit .   this   was   a   lifesaver   for   us ! ! !
best   pacis   ever !   after   trying   all   kinds ,   these   are   the   only   pacifiers   that   my   daughter   will   take .   i   love   them   and   they   come   in   such   cute   colors !   so   glad   we   found   these !   br   br   the   glow   in   the   dark   kind   are   especially   genius ...   no   more   searching   for   lost   pluggies   with   a   flashlight   trying   not   to   wake   the   baby   too   much .
not   good   for   babies   with   really   big   cheeks   i   really   like   these   pacifiers ,   but   i   wasn   t   able   to   use   them   for   very   long .   my   baby   has   really   chubby   cheeks   and   the   curve   on   these   pacifiers   started   to   make   sores   on   his   cheeks   where   the   pacifier   was   hitting .   i   tried   using   the   6   month   size   and   it   didn   t   seem   to   help   much .
favorite   pacifier   by   far !   my   husband   and   i   were   given   two   orange   newborn   gumdrop   pacifiers   in   the   hospital   and   found   that   our   daughter   took   to   them   quickly   as   she   needed   the   additional   suckling   time   and   i   couldn   t   be   her   permanent   pacifier .   before   we   found   that   our   daughter   prefers   the   gumdrop ,   we   tried   the   following   pacifiers   because   we   received   a   ton   at   my   baby   showers   1   philips   avent   soothie   pacifier   look   similar   to   gumdrop ,   but   doesn   t   have   the   nook   cutout   around   the   nose   2   nuk   latex   pacifier   and   the   nuk   silicone   have   the   angled   tip   upwards   3   various   mam   pacifiers   shorter   oval   sized   stem   and   silicone   4   dr .   brown   s   orthodontic   pacifier   angled   tip   upwards   our   daughter   preferred   silicone   to   latex   and   wasn   t   picky   at   first ,   but   once   she   hit   6   months ,   she   wouldn   t   take   any   of   the   others   than   her   gumdrop !   we   don   t   give   out   5   stars   easily   unless   we   really   love   something ,   but   these   gumdrop   pacifiers   are   the   best .   one   thing   to   note   i   wasn   t   sure   what   the   difference   was   between   the   newborn   vs .   full   term   gumdrop   pacifier   newborn   was   what   we   received   in   the   hospital   on   the   package   but   it   said   full   term   on   the   ones   we   ordered   here   on   amazon .   from   what   we   can   tell ,   we   believe   the   only   difference   is   the   thickness   consistency   of   the   silicone .   the   newborn   ones   appear   to   be   a   little   thinner   softer   type   of   silicone   and   the   full   term   ones   are   a   little   thicker   sturdier   perhaps   since   they   chew   harder   especially   now   that   there   are   teeth !   there   is   no   difference   in   the   length   of   the   stem   or   the   overall   shape   of   the   pacifier .   we   purchased   the   natural   scent   as   we   thought   that   was   safest   and   we   just   make   sure   to   wash   them   often   so   they   don   t   get   the   plastic   type   of   smell   pacifiers   sometimes   carry .   but   next   time   we   may   try   to   order   the   vanilla   scent   just   to   see   what   the   difference   may   be .   pros   love   the   nose   cut   out   because   they   can   breathe   easily   without   interference   and   it   is   made   to   conform   to   their   face   comfortable   not   like   the   soothie   that   takes   up   their   whole   face !   hole   for   stem   is   easy   for   her   to   put   her   finger   through   when   she   wants   to   chew   on   something   with   some   substance   medical   grade   silicon   dishwasher   safe   one   piece   of   silicone   is   easy   to   clean   and   doesn   t   collect   in   hard   to   reach   crevices   soft   and   pliable   no   nipple   confusion   when   breastfeeding   firm   enough   that   your   little   one   can   chew   away   but   lightweight   hole   that   you   can   loop   a   pacifier   strap   through   it   to   attach   to   their   clothes   available   in   four   colors   pink ,   purple ,   orange   and   blue   cons   none !   one   we   received   from   the   hospital   recently   cracked   after   7.5   months   of   use   as   she   liked   to   chew   on   all   sides   of   them   now   that   she   can   grab   them   herself   and   she   was   bending   them   backwards   against   the   way   they   are   made   to   fit   smoothly   against   their   face   .   i   tried   giving   her   one   of   the   others   we   had   until   i   could   order   some   gumdrops   and   she   put   them   in   her   mouth ,   immediately   pulled   them   out   and   laid   them   on   the   ground   all   in   a   matter   of   two   seconds .   that   s   why   i   think   the   full   term   are   helpful   because   it   s   a   sturdier   silicone   likely   better   equipped   for   older   babies   toddlers .   just   recently   we   saw   asin   b004iohn8q   the   first   years   2   pack   gumdrop   infant   pacifier ,   pink   purple   are   now   sold   at   target   and   they   have   the   same   shape   and   appear   to   be   almost   identical   to   these   but   these   also   are   offered   in   one   more   color ,   green .   i   did   buy   some   just   to   see   if   they   were   different   and   i   noticed   the   difference   in   the   thickness   of   the   silicone   in   these   much   clearer   than   the   ones   on   amazon .   the   first   years   0   3   months   version   is   softer   thinner   more   pliable   than   the   3   months   version   which   is   a   thicker   sturdier   silicone .   the   best   price   is   still   on   amazon ,   but   still   a   good   back   up   if   you   re   ever   in   a   bind .
the   only   pacis   not   sure   why ,   but   after   trying   several   brands   my   son   only   likes   this   ones   br   they   are   vented ,   so   you   can   also   fill   it   with   water ,   freeze   it   and   use   it   for   teething
finally   a   pacifier   that   stays   in   my   daughter   s   mouth !   we   didn   t   use   a   pacifier   initially   as   it   is   not   recommended   right   away   when   breastfeeding .   when   we   did ,   we   initially   used   the   first   years   soothies   pacifiers   as   they   were   recommended   for   their   nipple   shape .   however ,   this   pacifier   had   an   odd   circular   shape   that   came   too   close   to   her   nose   and   was   also   rather   heavy   and   would   just   pop   out .   saw   an   ad   for   the   gumdrop   pacifier   made   by   the   same   company   with   the   same   nipple   shape   but   a   nice   nose   cut   out .   daughter   is   still   not   very   keen   on   pacifiers   but   this   one   she   will   use   and   it   does   not   cover   her   nose   or   pop   out .   she   won   t   use   any   other   type   of   pacifier !
thank   goodness   thank   goodness   that   i   was   able   to   find   these   pacifiers   on   amazon !   they   are   the   only   ones   my   son   will   use   and   it   seems   all   the   stores   around   have   discontinued   them .   i   wasn   t   too   worried   about   color   of   pacifiers   for   when   you   are   in   need   color   doesn   t   matter ... but   only   2   days   after   placing   the   order   i   was   pleased   to   have   them   arrive   and   extra   happy   to   have   gotten   blue   ones !   would   order   these   again   if   i   needed   too !
try   a   different   one   this   lion   came   with   a   snag   in   his   mane .   i   thought   he   silky   fabric   would   add   some   interest   for   my   baby .   but   it   just   runs   and   pulls   when   it   gets   snagged   on   something .   not   worth   your   money .   it   is   very   cute ,   though .
love   these   pacifiers   i   have   a   giraffe   and   this   elephant .   the   giraffe   is   my   and   my   daughter   s   favorite ,   although   it   seems   to   cost   more   than   the   elephant   everywhere   i   ve   checked .   i   get   so   many   comments   from   people   about   these .   not   only   are   they   cute ,   but   they   are   also   very   effective .   tiny   babies   can   find   it   easier   and   as   they   get   older ,   it   becomes   a   little   like   a   lovey .   mine   holds   the   ears   while   she   nurses   and   then   transitions   to   that   nipple   when   she   s   done   with   me  
fits   perfectly   we   bought   this   to   replace   the   flimsy   old   pad   that   came   with   our   used   changing   table .   we   were   sure   to   measure   it   before   ordering ,   since   changing   pads   come   in   various   sizes .   this   fits   the   table   perfectly ,   and   i   love   that   this   is   the   nicest   one   we   found   here   on   amazon .   many   of   the   others   looked   flimsy   not   as   durable   as   this   one .   they   all   seemed   to   be   very   thin   in   the   middle ,   unlike   this   one .   i   also   love   that   this   particular   pad   doesn   t   dip   way   down   in   the   middle   like   all   of   the   others ,   it   s   just   a   nice   gradual   indentation .   i   also   like   that   it   has   the   belt   to   ensure   that   baby   won   t   fall .   the   only   thing   i   didn   t   like   about   this   was   the   stinky   smell   of   chemicals   that   the   bag   it   came   in   had .   the   pad   itself   smelled   a   tiny   bit   like   that ,   but   once   i   had   it   out   of   the   bag   and   allowed   it   to   air   out   for   a   few   days ,   that   was   no   longer   an   issue .   i   would   suggest   doing   that   either   before   baby   arrives ,   or   allowing   it   to   air   out   for   a   few   days   before   using   it   at   the   very   least ,   so   that   baby   doesn   t   come   into   contact   with   the   chemical   smell .   overall   a   very   great   changing   pad ,   and   the   nicest   one   we   could   find   here   on   amazon .
perfect   lovey !   i   wanted   a   star   child   type   doll   for   my   8   month   old   daughter ,   and   this   works   perfectly   as   a   bedtime   lovey .   it   s   the   perfect   size   for   her   hands   and   she   has   loved   it   from   the   moment   i   gave   it   to   her .   the   doll   itself   is   very   very   soft .   i   love   that   it   s   organic   and   sustainably   made ,   too .   it   s   so   affordable   that   i   plan   on   buying   several   and   keeping   around   as   baby   gifts   i   know   many   mamas   that   will   like   this   for   their   little   ones ,   too .
not   safe   at   all   first ,   the   shades   arrived   extremely   wrinkled   out   the   package .   the   wrinkles   greatly   obstruct   the   view .   secondly ,   asides   from   the   wrinkles ,   the   shades   themselves   are   not   see   through   at   all .   i   could   not   see   anything   out   the   back   of   my   car   from   the   driver   s   seat   and   it   was   a   bright   sunny   summer   afternoon .   not   safe   at   all .   third ,   the   side   window   shades   were   too   large   for   my   2011   honda   civic ,   but   fit   my   other   compact   sedan   just   fine .   anyway ,   with   the   wrinkles   and   the   fact   that   i   cannot   see   a   single   thing   out   the   rear   window ,   this   will   be   going   back   immediately !
great   quality   entertaining   and   safe .   my   son   likes   the   monkey   and   i   like   being   able   to   keep   an   eye   on   him   in   the   car .   easy   to   use .
works   great   no   complaints   at   all   on   this .   does   exactly   what   it   s   supposed   to   do ,   and   it   s   also   easy   to   cut   if   you   need   to   trim   it   down   to   size .

love   the   bibs ! !   my   daughter   and   i   love   these   bibs   for   her   little   girl   my   granddaughter .   they   catch   all   her   spills   and   are   a   breeze   to   wash   up   by   just   rinsing   under   the   faucet .   they   fit   her   well   time   and   make   lunch   time   fun   and   easy   to   clean   up .   we   would   definitely   highly   recommend   these   bibs !
redturned   item   the   item   was   dirty   and   the   the   rubber   was   rotten   and   discolored .   it   smells   like   ammonia .   i   had   to   return   the   item   and   ask   for   a   refund ,   fortuately   i   had   it .
very   unhappy   with   quality   this   is   definitely   not   a   quality   piece   of   furniture .   i   knew   we   were   not   buying   top   of   the   line ,   but   i   have   purchased   cheaper   and   more   solid   fake   wood   pieces   from   target   and   walmart .   there   are   scratches   all   over   the   wood ,   and   i   definitely   anticipate   more .   unfortunately   we   were   pressed   for   time ,   but   i   definitely   do   not   recommend   this   piece   to   others .
cute   but   not   all   that   entertaining   i   thought   my   daughter   4   months   would   love   this   given   how   much   she   loves   her   sassy   go   go   bugs ,   but   she   really   wasn   t   interested .   it   is   cute   and   makes   a   nice   chiming   sound ,   but   it   doesn   t   seem   to   have   the   kind   of   properties   that   she   s   interested   in   right   now   crunchy   sounds ,   lots   of   things   to   chew   on ,   etc .   she   s   tried   to   chew   on   its   feet   and   wings   as   well   as   the   ribbons   that   decorate   the   body ,   but   had   a   hard   time   getting   a   purchase   on   anything .   i   keep   it   in   the   diaper   bag   to   occupy   her   while   changing   a   diaper   on   the   road ,   but   that   s   all   i   use   it   for .   i   gave   it   3   stars   because   it   didn   t   interest   my   daughter   very   much ,   but   it   is   a   well   made   toy .   i   have   no   complaints   with   the   toy   itself .
great   product   i   am   really   glad   i   made   the   switch   from   plastic   bpa   free   bottles   to   glass .   the   glass   bottles   keep   the   milk   from   spoiling   longer   and   are   very   easy   to   clean   vs   plastic .   not   to   mention   safer   for   your   child .   i   have   droped   the   bottle   several   times ,   with   the   cover   on ,   and   the   bottle   did   not   break .   the   outer   covers   are   bright   and   beautifull .   worth   the   money .   i   just   wish   i   got   these   when   i   had   my   first   child .   i   guess   one   draw   back   is   the   9   oz   size   is   a   little   heavy   for   my   9   month   old   to   hold   but   they   do   make   a   smaller   size .   also   the   nipples   collapse   and   do   not   vent   but   i   think   you   could   purchase   different   nipples .   these   are   not   problems   for   me .
i   like   them   perfect   for   freezing   baby   food .   the   plastic   is   fragile ,   so   you   do   have   to   be   careful   to   not   drop   them   especially   when   frozen   .   i   do   wish   they   made   a   2   ounce   size .   but ,   again ,   they   work   just   fine .
make   great   burp   clothes   i   got   these   only   to   use   as   burp   clothes .   the   get   smaller   and   kind   of   rippley   looking   once   washed   and   dried   but   my   little   one   is   a   very   messy   eater   so   i   need   a   lot   of   cloth .   works   well
baby   s   gotta   have   it !   this   product   is   great !   first   introduced   this   to   my   baby   at   two   weeks .   she   had   reflux   and   the   pacifier   seemed   to   help   sooth   her .   still   loves   it   today   and   she   s   6   months .   we   have   three   different   ones   but   the   lamb   is   our   favorite .
a   very   useful   baby   basic   when   i   started   getting   ready   for   our   first   baby ,   i   ran   into   the   word   boppy   everywhere .   i   wasn   t   sure   how   i   would   use   it ,   but   i   went   ahead   and   registered   for   one .   we   love   this   luxe   version   because   of   its   soft ,   velvet   front   material   and   neutral   stripes   on   the   back .   the   cover   fits   snuggly   and   matches   well   with   any   decor .   at   first ,   i   tried   using   it   for   breastfeeding   but   found   that   the   rounded   edge   made   it   difficult   to   get   the   baby   to   the   right   position .   i   would   recommend   mybrestfriend   for   this   use .   boppy   now   sells   a   wedge   for   breastfeeding   but   i   haven   t   tried   it .   the   boppy   has   many   wonderful   uses   over   the   course   of   a   baby   s   development .   prop   up   baby   for   playing   and   bottle   feeding   use   to   create   overhang   support   for   head   during   tummy   time   place   around   baby   when   learning   to   sit   as   head   cushion   when   they   fall   over   good   lap   cushion   for   nap   time   rocking   and   bottle   feeding   adult   pillow   for   napping   on   floor   next   to   baby   we   ve   really   loved   having   this   around .   the   regular   covers   are   fine   and   more   colorful ,   but   if   you   want   to   splurge ,   get   this   softer   one .   i   highly   recommend   getting   a   second   cover   so   that   you   have   another   to   put   on   after   the   baby   spits   up   on   the   cover   in   use .   also ,   when   i   received   this   as   a   gift ,   i   noticed   the   price   changed   every   couple   of   days .   definitely   don   t   pay   the   full   retail   price   listed   if   you   can   wait .
safety   first !   it   serves   it   s   purpose   well ,   but   due   to   our   very   old   hanging   style   windows ,   we   had   to   improvise   on   the   installation .   would   probably   have   rated   all   five   stars ,   if   we   had   newer   windows   and   had   an   easier   time   using   the   product
pink   glider   the   glider   i   purchased   is   very   comfortable .   the   color   is   perfect   and   has   alot   of   support   for   my   back .   i   like   the   idea   that   you   can   lock   the   rocker   in   place .   shipping   was   perfect ,   no   chips   or   broken   pieces .   i   was   very   pleased   with   my   purchase .
second   time   around !   i   so   wish   i   was   able   to   breastfeed   without   this   little   piece   of   plastic ,   but   apparently   its   not   going   to   happen .   because   of   bleeding   cracked   nipples ,   ineffective   latching   by   my   children   my   first   child   was   exclusively   pump   bottle   fed .   that   lasted   6   months .   my   second   child   i   discovered   the   shield   and   i   lasted   9   months .   my   third   baby   i   went   to   the   shield   on   day   3 ,   and   were   at   5   weeks   now .   there   is   no   way   i   would   be   able   to   feed   them   without .   and   after   pumping   exclusively   for   6   months ,   this   little   thing   has   been   a   lifesaver !   yes ,   it   is   a   pain   to   make   sure   i   have   it   with   us ,   but   worth   it !
summer   infant   day   night   baby   monitor   we   purchased   this   for   our   daughter   and   it   was   one   of   the   best   gifts   we   could   give   to   her .   when   she   puts   the   baby   down   she   can   watch   to   make   sure   she   is   ok .   you   not   only   can   watch   but   also   hear   their   every   move   so   you   are   aware   right   away   if   they   are   awake ,   etc .   the   monitor   is   clear   to   see   and   the   sound   is   very   good .   definitely   would   recommend   this   for   anyone   with   an   infant   or   if   you   are   a   caregiver   to   an   elderly   person .
perfect !   this   is   the   perfect   pacifier   holder .   our   daughter   uses   the   sassy   mam   pacifiers   and   we   are   able   to   fit   two   in   this   holder .   it   keeps   them   clean   and   makes   it   easy   to   find   a   paci   when   you   need   one !   great   buy !
excellent   for   breastfeed   babies !   i   loved   these   pacifiers !   they   are   the   best   pacifiers !   my   baby   was   breastfeed   and   i   found   these   and   they   are   great .   they   actually   simulate   a   nipple   and   move   back   and   forth   as   the   child   is   sucking .   so   they   are   wonderful .   i   have   tried   all   the   other   pacifiers   and   my   baby   still   seems   to   like   this   best   of   all .   only   trouble   is   stores   have   discontinued   them ... soo   now   you   can   only   find   them   online .   so   be   prepared   to   order   a   few   at   a   time !   some   folks   say   they   have   found   mold   in   them .   i   disinfect   my   nipples   and   pacifiers   in   boiling   water   every   week   and   have   found   no   sign   of   that !   these   are   a   terrific   product .   i   give   it   a   10   star   in   my   book !
wubbanub   love   it ! !   i   do   not   like   that   the   seller   made   it   look   like   it   was   only   10   and   then   oh   yeah ,   the   shipping   is   10   for   this   item .... wwhhhhaaaattt !   give   me   a   break .   but   15   20   is   about   the   normal   price   range   for   these   things   around   the   board   so   whatever   dragon   lady .   have   it   your   way .   it   was   always   easy   to   find .   i   wash   it   like   at   least   once   a   week   and   let   it   air   dry   and   my   little   man   loves   it   and   i   get   comments   on   it   all   the   time .   it   doesn   t   weigh   nearly   anything   so   it   s   not   hard   for   him   to   keep   in   his   mouth   either   like   i   was   thinking .   the   wings   are   much   more   bright   turquoise   blue   and   i   think   it   s   even   cuter   than   the   picture .
not   very   soft   my   daughter   is   5   months   old   now   but   i   have   been   trying   to   get   her   to   take   these   pacifiers   since   she   was   born .   she   hates   them   she   loves   the   ones   that   she   got   at   the   hospital ... they   are   green   soothies   i   think   made   by   advent   anyways ,   they   are   much   softer .   i   wanted   these   for   her   because   they   have   a   cut   out   for   the   nose   area   soothies   don   t   but   they   are   too   hard   firm   for   her   i   think .   she   just   throws   them   now   and   spits   them   out   immediately
gum   drop   pacifiers   these   are   the   only   only   pacifiers   my   granddaughter   likes !   they   re   most   like   the   ones   she   was   given   in   the   hospital   when   she   was   born .   if   she   loves   them ,   i   love   them ,   too !
great   product   this   is   great !   it   helps   keep   the   pacifier   near   baby   s   mouth ,   which   is   a   lifesaver   when   driving .   our   baby   also   loves   playing   with   the   toy   monkey .
alright   this   product   is   okay .   my   son   seemed   to   like   them   alright .   we   had   to   wait   till   he   was   a   little   bigger   to   use   them   because   they   covered   his   nose   at   first .   this   paci   is   a   little   stiffer   and   a   bit   longer   than   some   others   but   the   baby   doesn   t   seem   to   mind .   we   much   rather   prefer   the   gum   drop   pacifiers   by   hawaii   medical ,   but   these   have   been   a   good   back   up   when   my   others   are   all   over   the   place   or   being   steam   sterilized .   they   do   fade   a   bit   when   sterilized   but   the   gum   drops   do   as   well .
great   find !   i   was   so   lucky   to   have   found   these !   they   arrived   quickly ,   the   case   they   came   in   had   come   apart   when   i   opened   the   box ,   but   it   snapped   back   together   fairly   well .   made   the   perfect   gift   for   a   red   sox   fan !
wubbanub   is   great   my   son   only   liked   the   soothie   pacifiers ,   but   would   always   pull   them   out   of   his   mouth   and   then   get   upset   the   wubbanub   is   great   because   he   could   fall   asleep   holding   onto   the   wubbanub   stuffed   animal   and   the   pacifier   would   stay   in   place !
hilarious   gift !   when   my   friend   opened   this   gift   at   her   baby   shower ,   the   entire   room   erupted   in   laughter .   worth   every   penny .   i   doubt   it   ever   really   gets   used .   .   .   maybe   at   halloween   but   it   sure   makes   for   a   fun   gift  
only   one   he   would   take   i   too   got   these   pacifiers   in   a   gift   bag   from   either   babies   r   us   or   buy   buy   baby   and   would   highly   recommend   for   newborns .   br   br   that   said ,   we   didn   t   use   these   until   nursing   was   well   established ,   maybe   about   5   6   weeks   or   so .   i   was   reluctlant   to   use   but   there   are   times   when   a   pacifier   is   helpful .   these   were   the   only   ones   he   d   take .   and   when   we   started   doing   a   bottle   a   day   just   to   get   him   used   to   the   bottle   he   wouldn   t   take   any   other   nipples   but   the   mam   nipples   so   the   pacifier   worked   well   as   a   transition   to   the   bottle .   br   br   pacifiers   are   widely   available   everywhere ,   bottles   nipples   are   not   off   topic   .
baby   loves   these !   my   husband   is   a   die   hard   red   sox   fan .   being   from   new   england   we   just   had   to   have   these   on   our   registry .   i   had   my   doubts   about   them   since   they   weren   t   one   of   the   big   brands ,   but   my   baby   loves   them !   he   has   a   very   deep   palate   and   need   something   a   bit   longer   than   the   average   pacifier   to   trigger   his   suck   reflex ,   and   these   worked   great !
precious !   the   first   one   that   arrived   didn   t   work ,   but   a   couple   of   days   later   i   had   a   new   one   at   my   door !   very   happy !
gets   lots   of   attention   it   is   very   heavy   for   a   pacifier ,   but   it   gets   a   lot   of   attention   when   i   let   my   daughter   use   it ,   which   was   the   point .   it   s   not   the   style   pacifier   she   s   used   to   but   she   doesn   t   seem   to   mind   using   it ,   but   she   doesn   t   prefer   it   over   the   avent   paci .
son   hates   them   my   son   hates   how   the   nipple   on   these   is   so   straight   and   pointed .   he   refuses   to   suck   on   them   at   all   and   prefers   the   mam   style   over   this .
fading   fast   as   other   reviews   have   stated ,   the   bears   logo   doesnt   last   long .   we   were   careful   not   to   boil   or   microwave   them   but   didnt   matter .   disappointing   since   they   arent   cheap !
lamb   paci   great   idea ,   but   our   2   month   old   doesn   t   love   it !   our   son   moves   his   hands   a   lot ,   so   he   often   knocks   the   pacifier   out .   we   have   had   trouble   getting   it   to   stay   in .   i   m   hoping   when   he   s   a   little   older   it   will   work   with   him   a   little   better
best   pacifier   my   granddaughter   loves   her   wubbanubs .   she   has   several   different   animals .   they   are   well   made   ...   soft   and   cuddly .   pacifier   is   securely   attached .   worth   every   penny .
awesome   the   product   was   not   supposed   to   delivered   until   june   12   june   27   and   i   received   the   product   on   june   2 .   i   was   very   happy   with   the   product   and   would   purchase   more   items   from   this   buyer ! ! !
not   as   good   as   a   soothie   my   baby   girl   won   t   take   these   binkis   she   only   likes   soothies .   i   thought   these   would   be   comparable   because   of   their   straight   tips ,   but   she   doesn   t   think   so   and   spits   them   out .
okay ,   but   munchkin   better   this   pacifier   is   made   of   a   super   hard   plastic .   a   baby   cannot   bit   down   or   squeeze   this   thing ,   so   when   giving   nasty   tasting   medicine ,   our   baby   immediately   rejected   it   each   and   every   time   .   we   have   had   great   success   with   the   munchkin   dropper   and   like   the   flexible   nipple .   i   also   like   that   i   can   fully   clean   the   munchkin ,   while   this   one   does   not   work   with   a   brush .   it   s   just   a   little   channel   about   the   size   of   a   small   wire   that   leads   from   the   reservoir   to   the   nipple .
new   mother   s   helper   this   item   was   recommended   to   me   by   a   new   mother   as   the   best   gift   she   had   ever   received   for   her   new   baby .   bought   it   as   a   gift   and   hope   it   worked   as   advertised !
okay   but   after   using   a   wubbanub   for   a   few   months   i   dont   like   this   as   a   pacifier   holder .   it   s   huge   compared   to   the   wubbanub .   my   baby   is   seven   months   and   when   he   is   napping   the   bear   doesn   t   move   with   his   head   from   side   to   side   like   the   wubbanub   does .   it   was   slightly   difficult   to   put   the   soothie   pacifier   on   but   not   impossible .   i   ended   up   cutting   it   off   because   i   just   couldn   t   get   it   off   to   use   the   teether   attachment   it   comes   with .   i   like   it   much   better   as   a   teether   holder !
love   it !   my   son   loves   his   bull   nuk   as   we   call   it .   doesn   t   bounce   away   so   it   s   easy   to   find ,   and   stays   on   his   chest   in   the   stroller .   i   toss   the   whole   thing   in   the   laundry   with   no   problems .   we   get   so   many   compliments   on   it .   a   bit   bulky   for   nighttime   sleeping ,   so   we   only   use   it   during   the   day .
different   from   original   gumdrops   the   original   gumdrops   by   hawaii   medical   are   much   better ,   in   my   opinion .   these   are   hard ,   shiny   silicone   whereas   the   originals   are   softer   and   matte ,   which   many   breastfed   babies   prefer   since   it   is   less   plasticky .   the   shield   is   quite   hard   against   my   son   s   face ,   compared   to   the   original .   because   of   this   he   just   teethes   on   this   and   chews   all   over   it ,   and   its   useless   as   a   pacifier .   i   m   sure   these   are   fine   pacifiers ,   but   i   wish   they   had   a   more   obviously   different   name   than   gumdrops   by   the   first   years   instead   of   hawaii   medical   .
dragon   wubbanub   i   really   was   excited   about   this   item ,   but   i   was   disappointed   when   i   received   it .   the   quality   of   the   dragon   reminded   me   of   a   toy   from   a   happy   meal ,   not   the   high   quality   plush   i   expected   for   20 .   it   is   cute ,   though ,   and   the   colors   are   nice   and   bright .
just   great   my   baby   has   used   nuk   pacifiers   since   he   was   born .   he   loves   them   and   i   love   its   colors   and   designs .   i   feel   very   comfortable   and   secure   with   all   nuk   products .
if   your   baby   doesn   t   like   other   pacifiers ,   try   these ...   my   son   has   tried   so   many   different   types   and   brands   of   pacifiers ,   only   to   find   that   mam   are   the   only   ones   that   he   likes .   the   avent   ones   are   a   close   second   but   they   fall   out   easier   than   these .   my   son   used   the   smaller   mam   ones   before   but   after   4   months   or   so   he   wanted   something   bigger ,   and   this   was   it .   when   choosing   a   pacifier ,   try   to   consider   the   kind   of   bottle   nipple   your   baby   likes .   mine   uses   the   playtex   bottles ,   so   i   suppose   he   is   used   to   a   larger   nipple .   the   gerber   pacifiers   were   very   highly   recommended   to   me ,   so   your   baby   may   like   those   if   they   use   a   bottle   with   smaller   nipples ,   such   as   dr .   browns   bottles .   anyway ,   good   luck   and   i   hope   this   pacifier   will   work   for   your   baby   too .   it   has   saved   us   from   hours   and   hours   of   complaining .  
daughter   loves   them !   we   searched   for   pacifiers   that   she   would   take   for   a   while .   we   heard   about   these   and   tried   them .   it   was   worth   it !   she   loves   them .   the   only   problem   is   that   she   is   now   mobile   and   has   since   lost   all   but   one .   i   m   here   ordering   more .   that   s   how   good   they   are !
my   son   loved   it ! ! !   i   first   bought   this   item   when   my   son   was   a   little   less   than   2   months   old .   he   loved   soothie   he   got   from   the   hospital   but   he   kept   dropping   it .   i   wanted   to   get   this   one   so   that   my   son   could   hold   it .   he   absolutely   loved   it !   he   went   everywhere   with   it .   he   also   played   with   it   like   a   toy .   most   of   the   time , this   paci   was   the   only   way   to   calm   my   son   down .   i   washed   it   in   the   regular   washing   machine   with   rest   of   his   clothes   and   dried   it   in   a   drier   with   high   temp   many   times   and   it   was   still   fine .   i   ended   up   buying   total   4   of   them   for   my   son .   the   difficult   part   was   to   get   rid   of   this   pacifier   from   him .   he   didn   t   go   to   sleep   with   out   it .   he   became   so   fussy   without   it .   however ,   last   month   when   my   son   was   20   month   old ,   he   chewed   the   soothie   badly   and   tier   all   of   them   off .   i   didn   t   buy   another   one   for   him   but   i   gave   him   a   little   teether   just   to   keep   something   in   his   mouth   when   he   gets   fussy .   first   3   days   without   this   paci   were   very   rough   but   he   became   fine   without   it   after   a   few   days .   now   he   is   21   month   old ,   and   still   chews   on   teether   a   few   times   a   day   just   for   a   little   bit ,   but   he   is   completely   pacifier   free .   i   am   very   happy .   this   pacifier   helped   my   son   and   my   family   a   lot .
don   t   be   fooled   these   are   not   hawaii   medical   gumdrops ,   they   are   smoother   shinier   silicone   and   have   a   harder   plastic   plate   in   them .... my   son   knows   the   difference ! !   if   your   baby   likes   the   soothie   get   the   hawaii   medical   ones
awesome   paci   s   love   these ..... so   does   my   son ,   and   my   nephew   br   do   not   be   fooled   by   the   first   years   brans   gumdrop .... they   are   not   the   same ... the   inner   plastic   is   harder ,   they   are   a   glossy   silicone   not   a   softer   silicone .   my   son   loves   the   hawaii   medical   but   not   the   first   years .
i   love   it .   my   daughter   loves   these   pacifiers .   and   apparently   so   does   everybody   else   because   we   draw   so   much   attention   with   them .   they   are   just   a   little   pricey .
not   for   older   babies   i   bought   this   for   my   5   month   old   son   because   he   likes   having   a   paci   at   night   as   well   as   a   stuffed   animal .   first   of   all ,   the   paci   on   this   is   horrible   and   it   is   way   to   small   for   a   5   month   old   to   hold   in   his   mouth .   would   be   soo   much   better   if   it   had   a   larger   pacifier   and   a   mam   type   pacifier .   do   not   wast   your   money
heavy ,   poorly   shaped .   there   is   not   enough   shape   to   the   nipple   part .   combined   with   the   heaviness   of   the   plastic ,   baby   can   t   latch   on   to   it ,   and   if   she   does   it   falls   right   out   because   of   the   weight .   i   would   have   expected   much   better   for   the   price .   i   use   only   mam   now ,   but   i   can   imagine   just   about   any   other   pacifier   would   be   better   than   these .   i   gave   an   extra   star   because   they   do   seem   made   well ,   but   functionally ,   these   are   only   a   1   star .
must   have   in   your   diaper   bag   i   keep   this   in   my   diaper   bag .   my   son   really   loves   sophie   the   teether   giraffe   but   often   drops   it .   i   use   this   to   clean   it   since   he   likes   to   chew   and   it   s   always   in   his   mouth .   very   handy .   one   star   taken   away   because   the   wipe   can   get   dry   in   time   if   you   dont   use   it   often .
a   pacifier   that   stays   in !   we   had   another   pacifier   that   was   given   from   the   hospital .   the   one   that   we   used   was   really   good   too   except   that   it   was   too   heavy   for   infants .   out   son   is   now   8   weeks   old   and   he   always   love   to   suck   on   a   pacifier   to   comfort   himself   and   we   needed   one   to   put   him   to   sleep   except   the   old   one   would   fall   out   from   his   mouth   when   he   was   just   about   to   fall   asleep .   so   we   we   went   to   babiesrus   to   get   a   new   one .   this   is   the   one   that   we   bought .   it   s   pricy   compared   to   other   ones   but   we   wanted   to   right   one   so   we   didn   t   have   to   waste   money   on   trying   out   multiple   pacifiers .   this   one   is   great .   it   stays   in ! !   the   only   thing   that   bothers   me   is   that   water   does   get   into   the   pcifier   and   we   have   to   clean   it   really   thoroughly .   however ,   if   we   shake   the   pacifier   really   well ,   the   water   will   go   out   and   as   i   observed   the   pacifier ,   the   water   will   not   get   back   to   our   son   s   mouth .   we   got   another   one   from   amazon   so   we   have   2   handy .   however ,   i   would   probably   go   back   to   the   old   ones   when   he   can   suck   on   something   that   s   a   little   heavier .
poor   quality   lasted   less   than   one   week !   this   product   looked   like   a   great   idea ,   to   help   parents   with   sterilizing   pacifiers   that   fall   on   the   ground   over   and   over   and   over .   it   was   amazing   to   see   the   pacifier   ready   to   use   in   just   a   few   minutes .   but   the   quality   of   this   item   is   very   poor !   it   stopped   working   after   only   a   week   of   use ,   and   it   was   already   presenting   some   problems   since   day   3 ...   my   wife   got   really   upset ,   and   we   are   trying   to   return   the   item .
pacifier   cannot   be   replaced   the   product   is   a   good   idea ,   however   the   pacifier   cannot   be   replaced ,   it   is   sewn   into   the   animal .   there   are   others   on   the   market   that   the   pacifier   is   inserted   and   held   in   place   and   not   sewn   so   it   can   be   replaced .   wouldn   t   buy   this   again   or   recommend ,   it   s   cute   but   20   is   a   lot   for   one   pacifier .
love   it   but   ...   let   s   keep   it   brief .   awesome   thing   to   have   if   you   re   a   bit   paranoid   to   put   baby   down   out   of   your   sight .   period .   unecessary   absolutely ,   let   s   not   kid   ourselves .   but   i   love   using   it   because   it   puts   my   mind   at   ease   and   helps   me   be   a   better   not   so   crazy   mom .   the   only   problem   is   that   i   ve   dropped   the   video   screen   handset   and   now   it   does   not   seem   to   have   video   anymore .   i   ll   be   checking   into   it   and   such   but   it   only   dropped   from   the   coffee   table   to   the   floor   maybe   2   ft   and   now   kaplooie .   buy ,   enjoy ,   but   handle   with   kid   gloves  
not   the   best   i   like   that   this   bath   toy   storage   can   be   used   to   scoop   up   the   toys   out   of   the   tub ... but   that   doesn   t   really   help   when   you   have   to   sqeeze   the   water   out   of   squirting   toys   anyway .   i   like   the   mesh ,   it   s   pretty   heavy   duty   but   the   actual   storing   part ,   doesn   t   work .   i   can   t   get   it   to   hang   on   the   attachment   provided   so   it   ends   up   sitting   in   the   sink   anyway .
one   of   the   best   baby   products   i   own !   i   have   a   small   home   so   i   did   not   have   an   option   of   getting   a   big   swing .   i   registered   for   this   and   have   been   using   it   successfully   with   my   little   one   for   two   months   i   have   not   even   had   to   change   the   batteries   yet   .   now   that   i   have   it ,   i   cannot   imagine   having   anything   else   i . e . ,   a   large   stationary   swing   and   separate   bouncer   ,   regardless   of   my   house   size .   one   of   the   things   that   i   love   about   this   is   that   it   is   portable   i   can   even   move   it   around   when   my   daughter   is   in   it .   i   have   moved   it   from   the   kitchen   table ,   to   the   back   deck ,   to   my   bedroom ,   to   the   living   room .... wherever   i   go   in   the   house   i   can   move   it   so   that   i   can   see   her .   the   other   great   thing   is   that   if   she   gets   fussy   when   it   s   swinging ,   i   can   switch   it   immediately   to   vibrating .   i   can   t   imagine   having   to   take   a   fussy   baby   out   of   it   and   move   her   to   a   different   seat   just   to   see   if   she   wants   the   vibrations .   br   br   some   people   have   complained   that   the   swing   is   too   fast .   if   you   just   swing   it   without   a   baby   in   it ,   it   seems   fast ,   but   once   you   put   some   weight   in   it   it   swings   at   a   very   nice   setting .   other   complaints   were   that   it   is   too   hard .   i   purchased   a   snuzzler   asin   b000dzs720   kiddopotamus   snuzzler   complete   head   and   body   support ,   ivory   terry   which   i   move   from   the   swing   to   the   stroller ,   to   the   carseat .   this   too   has   been   a   lifesaver ,   since   newborns   are   so   small   and   cannot   support   themselves .   however ,   now   that   my   daughter   is   bigger   she   seems   perfectly   happy   in   the   swing   without   it .   br   br   this   is   a   product   that   i   could   not   live   without   as   a   parent .   i   recommend   this   to   everyone ! !

a   mothers   joy !   after   searching   for   baby   books   this   was   the   best   fit   and   match   for   our   son .   the   book   has   alot   of   options   and   was   a   perfect   mothers   day   gift !
love   it   my   son   loved   this   toy   when   he   was   8   months   old   and   still   loves   it   now   that   he   is   a   year   old .   the   only   down   side   is   that   it   does   not   walk   or   make   noise   for   a   long   period   of   time .   we   still   love   it !
love   the   monkey !   not   as   flexible   as   the   wubbanub ,   but   my   son   was   able   to   hold   onto   this   pacimal   pretty   easily .   i   wish   the   animal   faced   him   vs   me ,   but   that   s   okay .   it   s   much   more   weighted   than   the   wubbanub   so   it   stays   in   place   a   lot   easier   if   my   son   is   holding   it   however   if   i   m   trying   to   rock   him   it   s   harder   to   keep   in   place ,   whereas   the   wubbanub   i   can   kind   of   prop   against   my   chest .
get   one   !   bought   this   item   for   my   new   grandson .   he   sleeps   safe   and   secure   no   matter   where   you   sit   it .... it   s   like   a   hammock   for   babies .   he   is   so   much   more   a   part   of   our   daily   life   because   it   is   easy   to   move   him   from   one   area   to   another .   positioning   helps   keep   formula   down   also .   item   arrived   quickly   and   in   excellent   shape .
stroller   too   big   and   heavy   this   is   a   high   quality   product ,   but   the   stroller   is   so   damn   heavy .   my   wife   cannot   put   it   in   the   truck .   i   barely   can .   it   also   does   not   fold   nicely ,   after   folding   it   is   still   big .   they   should   have   used   more   lightweight   material   thinking   that   it   will   mostly   be   used   by   a   woman .   i   am   happy   with   everything   except   the   weight   and   size   after   folding .
great   for   us   this   worked   great   for   us .   my   two   year   old   daughter   does   not   like   to   sit   in   her   car   seat   on   the   plane .   she   wants   to   use   the   seat   belt   like   we   do .   she   wore   the   cares   well .   it   did   not   hit   her   head   neck   back   in   a   weird   way   and   made   reclining   the   seat   easy .   we   have   used   this   on   commuter   flights   and   in   business   class   on   international   flights .   using   this ,   the   seat   tray   can   fold   down   for   my   daughter   to   color   or   eat   not   an   option   when   using   a   car   seat .   there   is   no   more   work   to   do   to   remove   your   child   from   the   cares   system   then   to   remove   him   her   from   a   car   seat   undo   the   chest   strap   and   lap   belt .   it   was   much   easier   to   use   carry   the   cares   system   and   check   the   car   seat ,   especially   now   with   a   newborn .
like   it !   i   ve   used   this   for   my   son   while   we   ve   been   out   at   the   doctor   s   office   and   shopping .   my   son   is   2   1   2   and   in   the   middle   of   potty   training .   i   wasn   t   sure   if   he   d   sit   on   a   big   toilet   without   a   seat ,   but   with   these   potty   toppers   he   was   happy   to   sit   there .   i   was   happy   to   have   him   sit   there   too   because   the   topper   covered   up   a   lot   of   the   seat   so   he   didn   t   have   to   touch   it .   overall   really   like   the   product .
great   print   great   product   this   bag   is   great   for   any   type   of   on   the   go   wet   items ,   we   personally   use   for   cloth   diapering   when   we   are   not   at   home   but   have   also   used   for   swimsuits .   product   is   well   made   and   very   sturdy !
cute   idea ,   but   don   t   love   em   i   absolutely   love ,   love ,   love   the   idea   of   these   things   in   concept .   however ,   after   having   used   them   a   few   times ,   i   don   t   think   i   m   in   love   with   the   idea   of   them   anymore .   for   one ,   i   use   aveeno   baby   wash   in   my   daughter   s   bath   and   i   typically   squirt   just   enough   of   the   baby   wash   directly   on   a   washcloth   when   i   m   bathing   her .   enter   the   palm   mitts   i   squirted   baby   wash   directly   on   these   and   had   the   hardest   time   getting   all   of   the   soap   out   of   them   when   i   was   done !   i   would   personally   recommend   just   using   traditional   baby   washcloths ... not   worth   the   hassle   to   use   these   things ,   imho .
not   at   all   what   i   expected   for   the   price ...   the   animals   on   the   mobile   are   adorable   and   match   the   rest   of   the   bedding   set   perfectly .   that   said ...   the   rest   of   the   mobile   is   a   complete   let   down .   the   fabric   that   covers   the   arm   looks   incredibly   cheap .   the   crossbar   the   animals   hang   from   looks   cheap .   the   bottom   conveniently   hidden   in   the   picture   of   the   mobile   is   glaringly   white   and   plastic   and   looks   awful   against   my   cherry   crib .   if   i   had   seen   that   in   the   product   photo ,   i   would   have   never   bought   this   piece .   there   is   one   lullaby   that   plays   with   a   wind ,   which   is   fine   with   me ,   but   you   can   barely   hear   the   music   over   the   noise   the   gears   inside   make .   like   another   reviewer   said ,   i   wouldn   t   be   upset   if   we   had   spent   15   or   20   on   an   item   of   this   quality .   but   for   this   price   and   for   this   brand   i   d   expect   much   better .   i   will   be   writing   to   carter   s ,   as   well .   at   the   very   least ,   they   should   change   the   picture   on   the   product   page   to   adequately   show   what   the   mobile   looks   like .
great   mattress   for   the   price   good   mattress .   my   serta   mattress   for   my   other   son   isn   t   any   better .   i   would   buy   this   again   if   i   needed   a   mattress .
we   like   it   i   got   it   from   pavilions   vons   and   i   love   it , yeah   it   does   touch   the   floor   but   not   the   silicone   nipple   and   sometimes   when   u   r   at   the   mall   and   they   drop   it   ... its   better   than   the   regular   one   that   i   never   give   it   back   after   a   drop . im   gonna   get   another   one   from   amazon
baby   loves   this !   the   hospital   my   son   was   born   in   used   a   soothie   on   him   and   i   ve   used   them   ever   since .   i   love   the   soothie   but   it   isn   t   easy   to   keep   track   of   because   the   standard   pacifier   clips   don   t   work   on   it .   br   br   i   started   searching   for   a   way   to   make   it   easier   to   keep   track   of .   since   his   theme   animal   is   the   giraffe   i   found   this   cute   way   to   hold   onto   the   soothie   .   br   br   we   call   him   edgar   and   i   love   it   because   it   is   cute   and   more   importantly   i   can   find   it !   br   br   the   only   issue   i   have   with   it   is   that   grandma   had   to   reinforce   the   stitching   in   his   neck   right   after   we   got   it .   otherwise ,   it   has   been   a   lifesaver !
love   the   lamb !   this   lamb   is   adorable .   really   cute .   i   love   its   tiny   pink   nose .   our   daughter   loves   the   stability   of   the   wubbanub   and   the   shape   of   the   soothie .   everything   came   well   packaged   and   came   quickly .
love   it ! ! ! ! !   i   absolutely   love   this   pacifier .   they   are   easy   to   hold   onto .   when   i   need   to   be   hands   free   i   just   stick   the   little   tab   in   my   mouth   haha .   also   the   little   hole   in   the   middle   is   convenient .   when   my   son   is   first   trying   to   latch   onto   it   i   can   put   my   finger   in   that   and   help   him   get   a   better   grip   on   it .   it   s   also   really   funny   to   look   at .   lasst   but   not   least ,   they   are   the   only   types   of   pacifier   that   my   son   will   use .   he   loves   them !   they   re   a   lifesaver   for   me .
my   daughter   is   obsessed   i   used   this   bear   to   break   my   daughter   from   her   pacifier .   we   used   her   own   paci   on   it   for   a   while   and   then   switched   over   to   the   included   teether .   it   actually   worked !   she   s   19   months   old   now   and   she   still   loves   this   bear .   she   won   t   sleep   without   it .   i   wound   up   buying   a   second   one   just   in   case   she   loses   the   first   one .
every   baby   needs   a   wubbanub !   best   baby   invention   ever !   we   have   2   wubbanubs   actually   like   the   frog   better ,   it   lays   on   the   baby   better   for   ease   of   use   when   a   newborn   .   we   never   lose   a   paci !   easy   to   clean ,   just   throw   it   in   the   washing   machine .   our   baby   loves   holding   onto   the   animal !
daughter   loves   it ! !   i   added   this   to   my   baby   registry   and   my   daughter   loves   it !   she   is   almost   5   months   old   now   and   she   cannot   sleep   without   dragon .   my   aunt   bought   it   for   her   and   it   is   by   far   her   favorite   paci !   i   have   tried   others   when   dragon   needs   washed   by   hand   and   i   had   to   buy   a   red   and   yellow   puppy   wubbanub   because   it   closely   resembles   the   dragon ...   br   the   pacifier   is   very   securely   stitched   onto   the   dragon   and   it   is   relatively   easy   to   clean .   just   wash   it   in   the   sink   with   mild   dishsoap   and   a   cloth .   br   ultimately   this   is   a   great   paci ,   just   wish   they   weren   t   so   expensive .   br   br   update   my   daughter   is   now   almost   2   years   old   and   she   still   loves   this   binky .   it   is   her   absolute   favorite !   i   had   to   buy   a   second   one   just   in   case   the   first   one   needed   cleaned .   now ,   she   sleeps   with   both   and   will   not   sleep   without   at   least   2   1   in   her   mouth   and   the   other   in   her   hand .   br   the   stitching   has   held   up   wonderfully   through   the   extensive   use .   i   have   not   had   to   do   any   mending   to   it   at   all .   i   also   started   throwing   the   binkies   in   the   washing   machine   on   cold   delicate   and   throw   them   in   the   dryer   on   low .   cleans   them   and   they   have   stood   up   against   the   washings !
best   pacifier   ever !   we   were   given   one   of   these   pacifiers   at   the   hospital   when   our   daughter   was   born .   we   had   a   few   around   the   house   that   we   had   boughten ,   or   were   given   at   baby   showers .   she   definitly   prefers   these   pacifiers   over   the   rest .   they   dont   have   latex   in   them ,   which   is   nice ,   because   the   last   thing   you   would   want   is   for   your   baby   to   have   a   reaction ,   when   you   have   no   idea   what   alergies   they   may   have .   they   are   also   bpa   free ,   which   is   a   must   with   somehting   that   a   baby   will   have   in   their   mouth !   we   have   about   10   of   these   scattered   about   the   house .   great   product !
did   not   work   for   my   baby   this   pacifier   is   made   of   super   soft   material .   my   daughter   couldn   t   keep   it   in   her   mouth ,   it   was   so   flexible   that   it   didn   t   trigger   that   comfort   reflex   for   her .   it   was   really   cute   but   we   eventually   tossed   it   since   it   was   ineffective .
great   they   work   great   for   me !   granted   you   can   t   be   in   the   darkest   room   in   the   house   to   see   them   but   then   you   also   can   t   see   your   baby !   but   if   you   have   even   the   smallest   bit   of   light   for   your   baby   then   these   will   glow !
very   cute   pacifier .   this   is   the   cutest   little   thing ,   but   my   granddaughter   is   not   a   paci   freak   like   her   mother   was .   the   only   reason   i   didn   t   give   it   5   stars   is   because   the   pacifier   does   not   detach   from   the   cute   little   kitty   making   it   very   difficult   to   sterilize .
the   best   baby   present !   i   previously   bought   others   from   the   serta   site .   they   no   longer   carry   them ,   but   thank   goodness   amazon   does !   this   one   is   smaller   than   the   normal   ones ,   and   has   a   pacifier   in   its   mouth ,   so   is   perfect   for   the   newborn .   it   was   my   daughters   favorite   shower   gift .   amazon   also   has   others ,   and   they   are   all   equally   as   cute ,   soft ,   cuddly ,   and   ones   they   will   keep .
our   daughter   loves   these !   just   like   the   other   reviewer   said ,   the   shape   of   this   product   has   helped   with   rashes   around   my   daughter   s   mouth .   not   the   prettiest   pacifier   out   there ,   but   very   practical .
broken   upon   arrival .   do   not   buy   i   bought   this   for   my   child   before   he   was   born .   i   had   a   c   section   and   my   family   tried   to   help   by   setting   up   everything   for   me   upon   my   return   home   with   the   baby .   by   the   time   i   went   to   use   this   product   for   the   first   time   it   did   not   work   and   my   family   had   thrown   away   the   box .   now   i   am   stuck   with   crap   that   never   worked .   do   not   buy .
not   bad   not   bad ,   but   i   wish   they   come   with   small   boxes   to   keep   them   covered   when   not   in   use .   i   found   some   in   target   for   even   lower   prices   and   switched   to   them
best   pacifier   so   far ! !   i   wanted   to   get   the   first   years   brand ,   but   had   a   hard   time   finding   it ,   finally   i   gave   up   and   bought   this   one .   no   regrets ! !   my   son   has   tried   nuk   and   the   playtex   pacifiers   so   far   he   doesn   t   like   them ,   he   would   keep   spitting   them   out   and   cry .   i   finally   gave   him   this   pacifier   last   night   and   he   loved   it !   he   sucked   on   it   and   didn   t   want   to   let   go   of   it .   i   love   how   it   isn   t   too   hard   for   him   to   bite   on .   its   just   right   for   him .   i   recommend   this   pacifier   to   anyone !
too   big ,   and   it   gave   my   son   a   rash   on   his   cheeks .   my   husband   bought   the   0   3   size   for   our   one   month   old   son   hoping   to   replace   the   playtex   ortho   pro   pacifier ,   but   they   made   contact   with   his   nose   but   his   airway   was   clear   and   left   a   horrible   rash   on   his   cheeks   after   he   fell   asleep   with   it   in   his   mouth   for   about   an   hour .   the   rash   was   so   bad   that   the   pediatrician   recommended   the   use   of   1   hydrocortisone   cream   during   his   check   up .   i   did   give   the   item   2   stars   because   they   had   little   individual   covers   for   each   pacifier   to   keep   the   pacifier   clean   when   not   in   use .
excellent   pacifier   this   pacifier   is   perfect !   it   is   a   great   comfort   knowing   my   son   s   teeth   are   not   being   pushed   on   as   much   .   he   took   it   without   a   problem   and   liked   it   for   the   short   amount   of   time   we   got   to   use   it .   he   decided   he   didn   t   want   any   pacifiers   anymore   about   1   week   after   i   purchased   it .   i   don   t   think   this   pacifier   played   a   role   in   him   deciding   that .   overall ,   it   is   a   great   product   and   would   recommend   it .
natursutten   pacifier   i   purchase   this   product   a   few   weeks   after   my   baby   was   born   he   wouldn   t   suck   any   other   pacifier   but   this   one .   what   i   like   about   it   is   it   is   soft   all   over   even   when   baby   is   getting   ready   to   start   teasing .   its   like   a   teasing   ring   and   pacifier   in   to   one .   the   only   bad   thing   i   have   to   say   about   them   is   they   are   so   expensive   two   for   seventeen   dallors   is   just   ridicolous .   when   i   was   a   baby   they   were   one   dallor   each .   and   then   when   you   go   into   stores   you   can   get   pacifiers   for   about   two   for   five   or   six   dallors   and   then   if   you   loose   it   you   have   to   order   the   pacifiers   all   over   again   you   cant   just   go   purchase   them   in   the   store ,   so   that   leaves   you   with   a   fussy   baby .   i   wish   the   price   was   a   little   cheaper   and   they   had   some   store   locations   where   you   could   find   them

the   best   teething   toy   for   a   little   baby .   wife   my   5   month   old   will   not   take   any   pacifier ,   but   this   pacifier   like   teething   toy   has   been   a   wonderful   relief   for   her   teething   woes .   this   item   is   one   solid   piece   comprised   of   firm ,   flexible   rubber .   it   features   different   textures ,   and   every   angle   is   chewer   friendly .   in   addition ,   it   is   easy   for   tiny   fingers   to   grip .   one   down   side ,   it   does   not   cool   off   in   the   refridgerator .   husband   most   importantly ,   she   likes   it !
hard   to   open   and   hard   nipple   i   found   this   dispenser   at   a   local   store   and   bought   it   since   it   was   the   only   medicine   dispenser   designed   for   infants   that   wasn   t   sold   in   a   baby   kit .   i   needed   it   because   my   son   who   is   only   2   months   old   is   on   multiple   liquid   medicines   daily   and   multiple   times   a   day   at   that   for   a   few   medical   conditions .   he   was   gagging   on   the   meds   when   given   through   a   syringe   and   i   decided   he   needed   a   better   way   to   take   the   meds .   i   wish   i   had   never   spent   the   money   on   this   product .   safety   1st   made   a   horrible   mistake   with   this   product .   first   off ,   it   is   nearly   impossible   to   open   this   dispenser   to   get   the   medicine   into   it .   even   my   husband   had   difficulty   trying   to   separate   the   medicine   holder   section   from   the   pacifier   nipple   section .   second ,   the   medicine   started   leaking   out   from   the   rim   as   soon   as   we   inverted   the   product .   third ,   the   nipple   section   of   this   is   a   very   hard   plastic   material   that   is   also   very   large .   it   is   nothing   like   any   pacifier   i   have   ever   seen   a   child   use .   i   would   not   recommend   this   product   at   all .   i   would ,   however ,   recommend   the   asin   b002rjkh4g   safety   1st   hospital   s   choice   bottle   medicine   dispenser   as   it   does   the   job   perfectly !
hits   his   nose   these   are   great   because   they   have   a   cap .   however   if   your   child   has   a   small   face   then   beware   that   they   will   hit   his   nose   this   isn   t   huge   problem   but   the   plastic   does   rub   and   make   his   nostrils   red .   i   would   like   this   better   if   the   cutout   for   his   nose   was   larger   and   didn   t   rub .   my   child   is   1   month   old .
awesome !   totally   keeps   pacifier   within   reach   and   our   baby   is   learning   to   put   it   in   his   own   mouth   now   that   the   pacifier   isn   t   falling   all   over   the   place .   and   even   when   he   falls   asleep   and   doesn   t   need   the   soothing   of   the   actual   pacifier ,   he   likes   to   cuddle   with   the   stuffed   monkey .   the   only   con   is   that   i   had   originally   thought   the   pacifier   would   be   removable   for   easier   cleaning   or   be   interchangeable   with   other   pacifiers ,   but   that   is   not   the   case .   however ,   this   item   is   such   a   must   have   in   our   house   that   we   bought   a   second   one ,   a   dog   and   it   is   quite   fun   to   select   a   different   animal   .
my   son   loves   these !   this   pacifiers   or   ninnys   as   we   call   them   are   my   son   s   favorite   brand .   he   is   2   months   old   and   has   taken   to   them   from   his   very   first   week .   we   have   other   brands   but   avent   seems   to   be   the   one   he   enjoys   the   most .   i   also   love   the   shape   of   the   nipple   and   have   had   no   nipple   confusion .   i   was   worried   about   this   from   reading   various   articles   but   he   started   on   the   pacifier   from   his   4th   or   5th   day   of   life   and   has   never   been   confused .
not   easy   to   use   judging   by   the   shape   of   the   product   i   was   under   the   impression   that   the   pacifiers   would   just   click   in   place   and   i   would   be   good   to   go .   nevertheless   it   took   me   several   attemps   to   fit   two   pacifiers   in   there   and   when   you   re   raising   twins   time   is   everything !   now   i   have   finally   found   a   way   to   fit   them   both   and   i   m   pretty   happy ,   but   as   another   reviewer   said   it   does   not   close   firmly .   i   gave   it   two   stars   for   the   handle   that   makes   it   very   easy   to   hung   on   almost   everything .   i   wouldn   t   buy   it   again   or   recomend   it .
love   them !   my   5   month   old   daughter   has   had   these   since   3   weeks   old   loves   them ! !   we   re   tried   to   introduce   other   pacifiers   she   did   not   want   them .   only   these ! ! !
cute ,   but   has   issues   the   giraffe   is   cute   and   my   2.5   month   old   daughter   seems   to   use   it   just   fine ,   though   i   think   she   prefers   the   regular   soothies   for   now .   our   problem   with   the   pacifier   is   that   right   out   of   the   package   my   wife   noticed   a   split   in   the   seam   on   the   giraffes   back .   she   intends   to   sew   it   back   up   herself   so   its   not   a   huge   deal ,   but   fairly   disappointing .   anyway ,   we   ll   probably   buy   a   back   up   unit   always   gotta   have   backup   units   for   everything   for   babies !   but   would   prefer   better   quality   control .
it   is   her   fav !   i   had   to   buy   this   product .   after   receiving   it   at   the   hospital   i   tried   others ,   they   were   not   the   same .   she   loved   this   pacifier .
very   cute ! !   i   purchased   this   product   because   i   hated   running   in   my   son   s   room   each   time   his   pacifier   kept   falling   out   of   his   mouth ...   i   just   received   this   product   today   and   i   love   it ... it   s   super   cute   and   it   does   what   it   s   made   for .   as   soon   as   my   lil   man   2m   old   went   down   for   a   nap ,   i   decided   to   try   it   out .   it   does   stay   where   its   suppose   to ,   but   i   think   my   lil   man   still   needs   to   get   use   to   the   pacifier ,   for   he   turns   his   head   to   the   side   alot   and   the   pacifier   doesn   t   want   to   stay   in   his   mouth .   i   just   think   he   has   to   get   use   to   the   fact ,   that   the   pacifier   isn   t   going   anywhere   and   that   he   can   still   get   it   in   his   mouth   that   s   why   i   gave   it   4   stars   .   i   love   that   while   its   on   his   chest ,   he   can   grab   onto   the   dog ... it   s   seems   to   comfort   him   a   little .   i   would   highly   recommend   this   product   to   any   parent .
best   binkies   try   these   pacifiers   first ,   i   wish   i   had .   my   baby   loves   these ,   i   only   wish   we   could   attach   a   clip   somehow .   no   matter ,   i   am   sticking   with   these   as   long   as   he   adores   them .
happy   baby   i   had   tried   other   brands ,   but   my   4   month   old   likes   this   kind   the   best .   my   baby   only   uses   a   pacifier   to   fall   asleep   so   i   wish   they   came   with   some   sort   of   cap   or   case   to   keep   it   clean   when   it   isn   t   in   use .
easy   to   lose   a   pacifier   case   in   a   bright   red   easy   to   find   case   is   a   great   idea .   the   latch   to   affix   it   to   your   diaper   bag   has   a   snap   which   opens   too   readily   this   makes   the   case   way   too   easy   to   lose .   skip   hop   should   change   the   design   to   make   the   latch   close   with   velcro   instead .
this   paci   stays   in !   the   nuk   genius   pacifier   is   amazing !   i   had   started   him   out   on   the   paci   from   the   hospital   and   then   switched   to   the   regular   nuk   pacifier   which   was   much   better .   then ,   my   mother   bought   him   the   nuk   genius   and   it   s   so   much   better .   it   is   the   only   paci   to   stay   in   his   mouth .   this   means ,   that   i   don   t   have   to   constantly   put   a   fallen   out   paci   back   in   his   mouth   when   he   s   fighting   sleep .   i   love   this   product   and   do   not   have   anything   negative   to   say   about   it .   if   you   like   the   nuk   pacifiers ,   try   the   nuk   genius !
a   must   buy   item !   this   most   adorable   lamb   has   made   giving   a   pacifier   to   a   reluctant   baby   much   easier .   our   baby   is   exclusively   breastfed   and   only   took   to   a   pacifier   for   about   1   2   mths ,   and   then   said ,   no ,   thank   you ,   in   the   form   of   waahhs !   so   the   pacifier   isn   t   mommy ,   but   this   wubbanub   seems   to   help   calm   her   down   when   i   am   not   able   to   get   to   her   i . e .   while   she   is   in   the   carseat   .   she   has   even   put   herself   to   sleep   with   it   in   the   car   seat   and   the   stroller .   the   lamb   can   rest   comfortably   on   her   chest   while   she   finds   the   nipple   herself ,   instead   of   me   putting   holding   a   pacifier   to   her   mouth   which   would   also   annoy   me   if   i   were   her   .   as   others   have   stated ,   it   would   be   great   to   be   able   to   detach   the   pacifier   from   the   wubbanub ,   but   oh   well ,   it   is   still   a   must   buy   item .   you   will   fall   in   love   with   this   lamb .   i   even   named   it .   d
so   cute   and   so   great !   my   baby   loves   this   binky !   it   has   taught   him   to   hold   on   to   things   as   well .   i   like   it   because   i   can   kind   of   prop   it   up   on   him   when   he   is   laying   down ,   and   it   stays   in   his   mouth .   great   quality   and   very   cute !   you   won   t   be   disappointed !
boston   red   sox   baby   items   bought   this   for   a   baby   shower   gift   to   go   along   with   a   gift   card .   the   expecting   mom   dad   are   avid   boston   red   sox   fans   and   know   they   will   love   this   bottle ,   pacifer   and   bib   set .   comes   in   a   nice   presentation   box .
wears   out   fast   my   daughter   loved   the   feel   of   this   pacifier   and   did   not   want   to   part   with   it .   i   love   that   they   are   made   from   natural   rubber .   they   do ,   however ,   wear   out   super   fast .   after   a   month   of   use ,   the   loop   broke   and   the   nipple   was   coming   apart   from   the   ring   choking   hazard !   .   i   would   replace   it   each   month ,   but   soon   got   tired   of   that ,   especially   since   they   are   pricey .   i   switched   to   mam   pacifiers   and   have   had   no   issues   with   durability ,   plus   my   daughter   loves   her   mams ,   too .
awesome   product ! !   neither   of   my   other   two   sons   every   took   a   paci ,   but   my   newborn   so   far   has   really   gotten   attached   to   one .   this   product   is   awesome   and   really   helps   keep   the   paci   in   place   as   well   as   it   s   easier   to   handle   for   adults   without   getting   their   hands   all   over   the   paci .   i   love   it   and   plan   to   buy   at   least   2   more   soon !
works   but   not   our   favorite .   our   2   week   old   daughter   started   crying   and   screaming   from   gas   pain   and   would   settle   when   we   would   let   her   suck   on   our   finger .   she   is   exclusively   breastfed   and   we   were   worried   about   nipple   confusion   if   we   used   a   pacifier .   using   our   finger   was   often   inconvenient   so   we   eventually   decided   to   give   the   pacifier   a   try .   it   did   calm   her   right   away   and   i   liked   that   the   design   was   shaped   slightly   like   a   breast   nipple .   the   pacifier   did   change   her   latch   slightly   so   we   try   to   use   it   as   little   as   possible .   the   biggest   down   side   for   us   was   that   she   can   t   keep   it   in   her   mouth .   it   falls   out   or   she   spits   it   out   every   few   minutes   and   starts   crying   until   we   put   it   back   in .   for   her   the   mam   style   of   pacifier   worked   better ... it   didn   t   rub   on   her   chin   and   she   was   able   to   keep   it   in   her   mouth .   i   think   the   avent   soothie   works   ok ,   and   may   work   well   for   another   child .   it   just   wasn   t   the   best   fit   for   ours .
not   durable   we   have   used   about   5   of   these   and   they   just   wear   out   too   fast .   after   about   2   weeks   of   use ,   the   pacifier   become   stuck   to   itself   and   stays   completely   flat .   my   son   just   keeps   saying   flat !   these   are   too   expensive   to   keeping   buying   every   few   weeks .
gender   may   vary   i   was   disappointed   when   i   received   this   item   for   my   son ,   and   the   pacifiers   were   pink !   it   was   clear   in   the   item   description   that   colors   may   vary ,   but   i   assumed   it   was   just   the   design ,   not   blue   vs   pink .   why   would   the   picture   show   a   blue   pacifier ,   then   send   me   a   pink   one   green   or   yellow   would   make   more   sense !
great   teether   so ,   i   bought   these   when   i   was   expecting   my   daughter   who   is   almost   three   ,   and   we   still   use   them   as   a   teether   when   she   needs   to   chew   on   something   she   s   a   slow   teether .   she   unfortunately   never   took   a   pacifier   of   any   brand ,   but   she   loves   chewing   on   these .   they   are   super   durable   and   don   t   show   signs   of   breaking   or   cracking .   these   were   undoubtedly   the   best   teether   we   have ,   and   i   love   that   they   are   super   non   toxic .   i   sometimes   smear   a   little   toothpaste   on   them ,   and   let   her   chew   on   them   while   we   re   winding   down   for   her   nap .   while   it   doesn   t   replace   a   good   brushing   i   think   i   does   help   clean   her   teeth   without   the   tooth   brushing   fuss .
closes   not   tight   enough   i   had   bought   2   of   those   pacifier   cases   before ,   they   close   super   firmly   and   perfectly .   this   one   does   not   close   as   firmly  
it   is   okay   i   could   have   sworn   i   put   new   batteries   in   it   and   then   a   week   later   i   had   to   replace   the   batteries   again .   other   than   that   it   works   okay ,   it   s   pretty   easy   to   understand   but   it   does   look   like   a   cheap   toy   when   you   open   it .   am   i   sure   it   is   working   i   don   t   know ,   i   assume   it   is .   my   advice   is   get   it   if   you   really   think   you   need   it ,   otherwise   you   can   skip   it .
excellent .   bought   one   of   these   to   go   along   with   my   sons   vampire   costume   and   everyone   loved   it .   decent   buy   that   put   the   finishing   touches   on   my   sons   costume .  
loved   the   paci   until   it   fell   apart   videoid   mo2rbn29pvq4lty   by   the   look   of   this   pacifier   i   would   never   have   thought   it   possible   to   fall   apart ,   but   it   has .   i   purchased   this   about   a   month   ago   and   my   baby   loved   it .   my   baby   is   a   newborn ,   so   obviously   he   s   not   chewing   on   it   or   doing   anything   crazy   to   damage   it .   there   is   a   semi   hard   piece   of   plastic   in   the   inside   of   this   pacifier ,   and   i   guess   the   sucking   motion   itself   caused   the   hard   plastic   to   cut   its   way   through   the   soft   plastic .   now   the   soft   plastic   has   worn   off   of   the   sides   of   the   pacifier   and   it   looks   really   torn   up .   if   my   baby   was   old   enough   to   maneuver   the   pacifier   himself   it   would   even   be   considered   unsafe   because   he   could   easily   tear   off   more   plastic   into   his   mouth .   i   am   going   to   order   a   new   pacifier   now ,   but   not   this   kind .
love   the   pacifiers ,   hate   color   choice   these   are   the   only   pacifiers   my   son   will   somewhat   take .   it   s   really   annoying   though   that   i   purchased   two   packs   and   they   are   all   pink .   please   give   an   option   to   choose   color   or   make   them   gender   neutral !   we   use   them   at   home   but   come   on .
wrong   item   shipped ! ! ! ! !   me   too ! ! ! !   i   ordered   these   in   the   newborn   size   as   stated   in   the   item   description   ,   but   i   received   full   term   size   pacifiers   instead !   please   be   aware   that   this   may   happen   to   you   as   well   there   is   another   2   reviewers   who   posted   about   the   same   experience   .
wubbanub   a   hit !   i   am   a   nanny   to   9   month   old   twins .   i   bought   this   elephant   paci   as   a   gift   for   easter   for   1   of   the   twins   .   usually   the   paci   s   get   lost   are   difficult   for   child   to   put   back   themselves   but ,   not   with   this   paci !   best   paci   ever ! !
love   these   we   originally   used   the   soothie   pacifiers ... when   i   discovered   these   i   figured   they   were   the   same ,   just   missing   the   nose   well ,   my   daughter   thinks   they   re   different ... she   won   t   take   the   soothies   anymore   if   all   the   gumdrops   are   dirty   so   we   have   to   have   a   stock   of   these !
very   good   pacifiers !   these   are   the   3   month   ,   even   though   they   don   t   say   that .   very   excellent ,   daughter   likes   them .   she   is   starting   to   teeth   a   little ,   and   she   chews   on   them .   hold   up   good !
great   item   i   could   have   thought   of   a   better   gift   for   my   lil   baby   girl .   this   is   a   great   product ,   and   hard   to   lose .   my   daughter   is   only   2   months   old   but   she   manages   to   hold   onto   the   horse .   i   would   definetly   recommendthis   product   to   all   who   belive   in   giving   their   child   a   pacifier .
cute ,   but   the   giraffe   one   works   better   i   originally   got   the   giraffe   wubbanub   and   that   works   great   not   spit   proof   but   helps   tremendously   .   i   bought   this   as   a   backup   but   it   s   a   little   smaller   and   lighter   than   the   giraffe   one   so   therefore   it   doesn   t   work   as   well .   still   helps   though .
great   for   newborns ! !   these   pacifiers   are   great !   we   tried   four   different   kinds   for   our   newborn   baby   girl   and   these   were   the   only   ones   that   weren   t   too   big   for   her   little   mouth .   as   a   result   she   s   able   to   keep   them   in   her   mouth   for   longer   a   plus   for   the   parents !   .   i   am   also   breastfeeding   and   we   gave   these   to   her   her   first   week   home   and   she   s   never   had   a   problem   with   nipple   confusion .
baby   s   best   friend   baby   looks   adorable   using   it ,   and   it   does   what   it   s   supposed   to   it   pacifies   a   baby .   worth   the   buy   just   for   the   cute   factor .   now   that   she   is   grabbing ,   she   will   occasionally   take   hold   of   the   stuffed   animal   part   and   pull   it   out   of   her   mouth .   that   s   your   only   look   out   on   this   item .   you   want   to   stay   close   by   till   the   baby   s   asleep ,   so   you   can   pop   it   back   in   her   mouth   if   she   tugs   it   loose .
do   not   buy   summer   products   my   wife   and   i   purchased   2   sets   of   these   monitors   for   use   with   our   2   children .   both   monitors   broke   within   12   months   from   time   of   purchase .   i   reached   out   to   the   manufacturer   and   was   told   that   the   warranty   is   only   for   12   months .   if   we   had   known   that   these   baby   monitors   would   only   last   1   year ,   we   would   not   have   spent   the   200   for   the   item .
so   cute   i   have   these   near   the   floor   so   my   daughter   can   play   with   them ,   she   likes   them   and   they   have   stayed   on   the   wall   very   well .   they   look   great   in   her   room .
very   cheap   we   bought   this   border   to   go   around   the   room   to   cover   where   the   two   colors   we   used   on   the   walls   met .   our   paints   were   pink   and   purple   and   you   could   see   both   the   paint   and   the   dividing   line   through   the   paper .   this   paper   was   so   thin   and   cheap ,   any   color   will   show   right   through   it .
holiday   theme   picture   frames   frames   are   nice   but   the   quality   is   not   worth   the   money   especially   when   you   add   in   shipping   cost .   i   ordered   them   because   it   can   be   hard   to   find   frames   for   all   holidays .   if   you   are   able   to   find   them   in   your   local   store ,   i   would   advise   you   buy   them   there   where   you   can   see   the   quality   before   you   purchase .
wonderful !   we   love ,   love   this   car   seat !   we   bought   this   one   when   we   realized   how   great   our   first   roundabout   55   was .   so ,   we   have   two   now ...   one   for   each   car .   we   didn   t   want   to   hassle   with   switching   the   car   seat   over   each   time   we   took   a   different   car .   and   since   our   decision   was   to   install   using   the   lap   shoulder   belt   instead   of   the   latch   system ,   installation   takes   a   few   more   minutes   than   we   have   on   a   daily   basis .   we   switched   our   baby   over   to   this   car   seat   at   about   6   mo   old ,   but   i   can   see   how   this   seat   would   also   accommodate   a   much   smaller   baby   too .   we   plan   for   him   to   use   this   until   he   outgrows   it   and   moves   into   a   booster .   my   only   concern   is   whether   or   not   he   will   outgrow   this   before   he   can   safely   sit   in   a   booster .   the   seat   seems   to   fit   him   perfectly   now ,   so   i   wonder   how   much   growing   he   can   do   before   he   s   too   big .   and ,   we   re   almost   already   using   the   entire   strap   length   not   much   more   slack   to   pull   out   .   however ,   we   had   these   concerns   prior   to   deciding   on   purchasing   this   car   seat   and   then   purchasing   a   second   ,   and   we   are   still   entirely   happy   with   this   purchase .   i   still   would   not   buy   anything   else   while   having   these   concerns .   the   quality   is   wonderful .   i   have   experience   with   other   brands   that   our   son   s   grandparents   have   in   their   vehicles ,   and   i   can   say   that   i   d   never   buy   any   of   them   instead .   you   can   t   even   compare   the   quality   and   comfort .   the   other   britax   models   are   great   too ,   but   we   couldn   t   spend   300   on   a   car   seat   when   we   needed   to   buy   two .   plus ,   a   friend   of   mine   has   the   model   with   the   built   in   head   supports ,   and   because   her   son   was   so   tall ,   he   was   forced   to   use   a   different   car   seat   because   his   shoulders   were   uncomfortable .   we   figured   we   were   safest   if   we   just   went   with   the   basic   model ,   which   has   proven   so   far   to   be   a   good   decision .   highly   recommend ,   as   we   will   be   repeat   purchasers   of   this   car   seat .
smaller   then   expected   this   chair   is   super   small !   i   was   very   disappointed   when   it   arrived .   it   is   much   smaller   then   it   appears   online .
junk   bad   quality   item .   it   has   never   been   able   to   hold   a   charge ,   it   has   static ,   and   the   plug   comes   out   easily .   do   not   buy !   so   annoying .
necessity   a   boppy   pillow   is   an   absolute   must   for   a   nursing   mother .   i   had   one   with   my   son ,   and   knew   that   it   was   the   one   thing   i   would   need   for   my   new   baby .   i   probably   got   more   use   out   of   the   boppy   pillow   than   any   other   baby   item   besides   diapers !   it   s   perfect   for   baby   to   lie   on   while   you   re   nursing ,   or   even   for   baby   to   sleep   on   mom   or   dad   s   lap .   it   saves   your   back   by   keeping   baby   up   a   little   higher   than   your   legs ,   so   you   don   t   have   to   hunch   over .   it   s   also   great   to   lay   baby   on   the   floor ,   since   it   props   them   up   a   little   bit ,   but   not   too   much .   the   cover   on   this   one   is   super   soft ,   and   is   even   removable   for   washing ,   which   helps   a   lot .   the   price   is   great ,   considering   that   a   bare   boppy   pillow   is   typically   thirty   five   dollars ,   and   each   cover   is   at   least   twenty   not   including   the   soft   cozy   ones ,   which   are   a   little   more   .   overall   great   to   have ,   i   highly   recommend   it   for   a   new   baby .
not   a   good   choice   this   children   s   toy   is   nostalgic   and   very   cute .   however ,   there   is   a   distinct   rubber   smell   and   a   very   odd   taste ,   yes   i   tried   it ,   that   my   baby   did   not   enjoy .   also ,   if   it   is   soiled   it   is   extremely   difficult   to   clean   as   the   rubber   is   a   kind   of   porus   material   and   does   not   clean   well .   the   final   thing   is   the   squeaking   device   inside   which   stopped   working   after   the   first   couple   of   days .   i   returned   this   item   feeling   i   had   overpaid   for   a   toy   that   was   defective   and   did   not   meet   my   expectations .   please   do   not   be   swayed   by   the   cute   packaging   and   hype   surounding   it   as   i   was .   one   more   thing ,   i   was   given   a   full   refund   from   amazon   without   any   problem .
sort   of   meets   needs   i   thought   this   seat   cover   was   a   great   idea   to   stop   my   toddlers   dirty   shoes   from   grinding   into   the   back   of   my   carseats .   concern   1   was   when   i   had   to   really   stretch   it   to   get   the   elastic   loop   to   fit   over   and   around   the   seat .   it   did   eventually   fit   without   repercussion ,   though   i   believe   the   too   snug   fit   creates   concern   2 ,   which   is   that   the   mat   doesn   t   cover   high   enough .   if   you   have   forward   facing   toddlers   still   in   relatively   high   sitting   carseats ,   the   limiting   stretch   of   the   elastic   loop   around   the   lower   bend   of   the   seat   pulls   the   mat   down   too   far .   this   outcome   leaves   a   gap   of   about   4   5   inches   at   the   top   of   the   seat ,   which   is   exactly   where   their   little   feet   kick .   that   was   the   whole   reason   i   got   this   mat .   it   would   be   better   constructed   if   the   elastic   loop   was   adjustable ,   giving   enough   slack   to   place   it   higher   on   the   seat ,   which   would   allow   tightening   of   the   head   rest   connecting   straps   to   close   the   gap .   not   so .   i   ve   pulled   the   velcro   head   rest   straps   as   tightly   as   possible   to   keep   the   mat   held   high ,   but   it   s   still   not   the   coverage   i   thought   i   was   buying .   br   br   my   verdict   is ,   when   they   re   older   and   in   booster   seats   these   mats   will   be   fine .   while   they   are   still   in   carseats ,   it   just   doesn   t   cover   the   area   that   s   most   vulnerable .
good   for   a   nursery   it   looks   nice   in   my   babys   nursery !   i   have   read   a   lot   of   reviews   about   difficult   assembly   before   i   purchased   it ,   but   my   husband   had   it   assembled   in   about   45   minutes   by   himself .   the   only   problem   i   found   is   the   paint   was   a   little   chipped   on   the   bottom   of   one   of   the   drawers   i   posted   an   image   under   the   pictures   section   ,   nothing   a   white   paint   marker   didn   t   take   care   of   though .   other   than   that   it   is   pretty   much   what   i   expected !
sophie   my   granddaughter   s   new   best   friend !   i   gave   my   4   month   old   granddaughter   sophie   for   easter   and   they   have   been   inseparable   ever   since !   my   daughter   says   it   s   the   only   thing   that   seems   to   soothe   her   gums   and   she   will   not   let   it   go .   sophie   has   also   become   her   security   toy .   i   m   ordering   another   one   to   keep   at   my   house   just   in   case !   i   would   highly   recommend   her !   asin   b000idslog   vulli   sophie   the   giraffe   teether   is   amazing !
ok ,   but   not   a   soothie   i   bought   these   not   on   amazon   at   the   store   today .   my   son   is   3   months   old   and   ebf   and   has   never   taken   a   pacifier   and   all   of   a   sudden   yesterday   magically   started   taking   the   soothie   he   always   spit   them   out   and   made   yuck   faces   before   and   would   prefer   breast ,   his   hand ,   or   my   hand   .   i   was   so   excited ,   but   didn   t   like   how   it   covered   his   nose ,   and   in   my   excitement   i   ran   to   the   store   and   bought   two   gumdrop   pacifiers .   when   i   got   them   out   of   the   package   though ,   i   started   to   wonder   if   they   were   really   just   like   the   soothie   like   i   had   been   told .   they   were   heavier ,   thicker ,   stiffer ,   and   more   plastic   y   feeling .   my   son   does   take   it ,   but   he   isn   t   as   willing   to   take   it   and   it   falls   out   of   his   mouth   a   lot   more   than   the   soothie   and   he   won   t   sleep   with   it   in   his   mouth .   i   must   say   i   am   a   bit   disappointed .
feels   great !   this   is   my   2nd   child   that   i   have   breastfed .   i   really   didn   t   pump   often   with   my   previous   son   because   he   wouldn   t   take   a   bottle .   i   was   determined   to   get   this   child   to   be   able   to   take   a   bottle .   i   had   some   issues   with   nursing   and   ended   up   meeting   with   a   lactation   consultant .   in   my   meeting   with   her ,   i   learned   there   was   different   sizes   for   the   pump .   i   never   knew   that !   i   dealt   with   the   pinching   feeling   because   i   thought   that   was   how   pumping   was   suppose   to   feel .   she   was   the   one   who   told   me   that   there   was   different   sizes   and   taught   me   how   things   should   look   when   pumping .   i   ordered   the   30mm   thinking   it   was   big   enough   and   found   out   that   it   wasn   t .   i   was   so   glad   to   find   the   36mm ... no   more   pinching   feeling !   it   feels   great !   it   s   pretty   close   to   how   things   feel   when   i   nurse   my   son !   d
doesn   t   fit   in   dr .   brown   s   bottles !   i   was   looking   for   a   new   bottle   brush   instead   of   using   that   cheap ,   foam   one   from   munchkin   and   this   ones   mesh   brush   looked   like   it   would   hold   up   better .   unfortunately ,   it   doesn   t   fit   in   my   dr .   brown   bottles .   it   will   barely   go   in   the   bottle   itself   and   won   t   go   in   the   clear   tubes   at   all .
love   love   it ! ! !   my   daughter   has   recently   started   to   pull   herself   up   in   her   crib .   of   course   she   had   started   chewing   on   the   crib   rails .   i   did   not   want   her   doing   this ,   so   i   bought   this   product .   i   have   to   admit   i   was   a   bit   unsure   at   first   as   i   was   reading   the   reviews .   but   i   decided   it   seemed   like   the   best   thing   on   the   market .   i   am   so   glad   i   got   it .   it   stays   in   place   very   well   and   does   not   move   when   she   pulls   herself   to   a   standing   position .   i   am   now   ordering   two   more   of   these   for   my   sister   as   she   has   a   little   girl   too !   i   would   highly   recommend   this   product .
love   it !   there   are   so   many   reasons   your   child   will   love   this   bear !   i   had   two   wubanubs   for   our   infant ,   which   is   all   well   and   good .   but   when   he   grew   out   of   the   infant   pacifier   and   was   teething ,   he   couldnt   use   them   anymore ,   they   are   sewn   in !   this   binky   bear   i   was   able   to   attach   a   teething   binky   to   him !   and   take   it   off   and   put   a   different   binky   on   another   day ,   my   son   prefers   this   bear   at   bed   time   now   because   he   cuddles   him !   i   love   the   binky   bear !
love   these   my   daughter   was   using   the   soothie   brand   pacifier   i   wanted   to   use   it   and   we   had   gotten   it   in   the   hospital   when   i   saw   these   i   thought   they   were   interesting ,   so   i   bought   some   and   now   these   are   all   she   ll   use ... interestingly   enough ,   she   can   tell   the   difference   between   the   two   and   will   refuse   the   soothie   brand   pacifiers   now .   i   love   that   i   can   see   more   of   her   face   with   these   and   that   they   give   her   more   breathing   space   when   she   has   a   cold ...
great   for   traveling   these   are   a   must   have   at   restaurants   when   my   daughter   drops   all   her   toys   on   the   floor !   since   these   wipes   are   food   grade   safe   ,   i   use   them   to   clean   the   nipples   of   bottles   while   on   the   go .   these ,   combined   with   the   ready   to   eat   similac   make   for   a   much   easier   trip !
just   like   the   soothies   these   a   good   pacifiers .   my   daughter   prefers   the   ones   with   the   same   nipple   as   the   soothies   that   she   used   in   the   hospital .   these   have   the   same   nipple   but   with   a   bit   harder ,   more   contoured   surround .   if   your   kids   don   t   like   the   super   soothies ,   but   you   re   worried   about   them   bending   the   soothies   too   much   and   choking   on   them   ,   the   gumdrops   are   a   great   compromise .   these   are   also   a   great   option   if   you   use   a   pacifier   leash   because   they   provide   an   additional   hole   in   the   tab .
love   this   love   this ! ! !   got   this   for   my   son   when   he   was   just   newborn .   i   was   shopping   around   for   a   binkie   for   him ,   and   when   i   came   upon   the   wabbanub   s   i   just   fell   in   love   with   them .   they   are   just   the   cutes   thing ,   it   s   also   very   good   cause   it   doesn   t   go   flying   out ,   when   he   s   sucking   on   it .   even   as   a   newborn   he   started   to   hold   on   to   it   with   his   arms   around   it .   we   love   it ,   we   ve   had   so   many   compliments   about   it .   i   d   recommend   it   to   any   mom   shopping   for   a   binkie .
great   teether   this   is   the   next   natural   step   from   soothie   pacifier   to   teether .   great   idea !   i   noticed   that   my   daughter   was   starting   to   pull   her   soothie   pacifier   out   and   chew   on   the   sides   when   she   was   3   4   months   old .   i   saw   this   on   amazon ,   and   thought   it   made   sense .   it   s   a   great ,   tough ,   solid   piece   teether   that   she   can   use   as   a   back   up   pacifier !
great   idea !   my   son   loves   his   wubbanubs   also   has   the   giraffe   .   it   does   help   keep   the   pacifier   in ,   although ,   like   others   stated ,   it   is   not   perfect .   it   is   a   pain   to   clean   because   the   pacifier   is   attached .   i   would   strongly   recommend   buying   two   so   you   can   throw   one   in   the   wash   if   soiled .   i   threw   it   in   the   washer   in   a   delicate   laundry   bag   and   let   it   air   dry   without   any   issues .   my   son   really   likes   to   squeeze   the   stuffed   animal   when   he   has   the   pacifier   sometimes   a   pain   because   he   grabs   it   and   pulls   it   out   unintentionally ...   but   all   in   all   a   great   idea !   a   must   have   for   babies   and   their   parents   who   love   their   pacifiers   but   can   t   quite   figure   out   how   to   keep   them   in .
love   them   my   daughter   loves   these   pacifiers .   i   have   tryed   other   ones   but   she   likes   these   the   best .   i   highly   recommended   them .
nice   looking   i   like   these   pacifiers .   they   are   nice   clean   and   basic   looking .   they   are   easy   to   clean   and   the   plastic   doesn   t   get   all   nasty   looking ,   it   stays   nice   and   clear .   the   only   problem   i   see   is   something   that   is   the   same   with   all   the   pacifiers   i   have   bought ... water   gets   inside   the   nipple   and   eventually   makes   the   inside   of   it   have   a   cloudy   look .   that   doesn   t   effect   the   outside   of   it   though .   the   plate   of   the   pacifier   has   plenty   of   air   holes   to   help   with   air   circulation   around   the   skin .   the   best   thing   about   these   is   there   is   no   top   or   bottom   to   it .   this   is   good   for   a   baby   learning   to   put   his   own   pacifier   in   his   mouth   or   a   half   asleep   baby   grabbing   for   it   in   the   middle   of   the   night .   these   come   in   a   2   pack   of   blue   and   red   or   green   and   orange .   any   are   good   for   boy   or   girl .
the   best   pacifier   for   young   babies   this   is   an   amazing   pacifier .   it   actually   stayed   in   my   6   week   old   daughter   s   mouth !   the   soothie   pacifier   is   the   only   kind   my   baby   likes ,   but   i   was   constantly   having   to   pick   it   up   or   hold   it   in   her   mouth   for   her .   she   was   too   young   to   hold   it   in   her   mouth   herself .   the   wubbanub   is   weighed   down   by   the   attached   stuffed   animal   and   it   rests   on   your   baby   s   chest .   so   if   it   does   fall   out ,   it   can   usually   be   recovered   by   your   little   one .   this   was   a   lifesaver   during   a   7   hour   car   ride !   i   m   such   a   fan   that   i   bought   a   second   one   because   i   don   t   know   what   i   would   do   if   we   ever   lost   or   misplaced   the   original   one   we   bought
good   for   breastfeeding   babies .   we   went   with   the   soothie   pacifier   because   i   am   breastfeeding   and   we   wanted   something   that   wouldn   t   cause   too   much   confusion .   my   daughter   loved   this   pacifier ,   so   we   bought   the   pink   purple   ones   to   have   extras   in   the   diaper   bag ,   in   case   one   got   lost   and   they   always   get   lost   lol !   .   we   never   had   an   issue   with   it   causing   troubles   with   her   breastfeeding .   i   know   several   other   breastfeeding   moms   who   use   this   pacifier   too .   my   daughter   has   now   found   her   thumb ,   so   prefers   that   to   a   pacifier ,   but   i   really   liked   this   pacifier .   plus   it   is   easy   to   clean   as   it   is   one   piece .   we   did   buy   and   try   the   gumdrop   pacifiers   as   they   have   the   same   nipple ,   but   are   shaped   to   fit   their   face   they   have   a   curve   to   the   base   and   a   cutout   for   the   nose .   my   daughter   didn   t   like   those   as   much   as   her   regular   soothie .
great   pacifier   but   be   careful   still   my   one   year   son   still   uses   his   pacifier   from   time   to   time   and   it   has   been   very   helpful .   however ,   since   turning   one   he   has   been   using   it   less   and   less   and   playing   with   it   more .   he   has   intentionally   folded   the   pacifier   and   put   the   entire   thing   in   his   mouth   causing   him   to   gag .   so   it   is   definitely   possible   for   the   pacifier   to   fit   into   a   childs   mouth .   be   very   careful   if   your   child   starts   bending   and   folding   the   pacifier   it   could   become   a   choking   hazard .   until   then   it   is   a   great   pacifier   and   your   child   will   love   it .
baby   1   loved   them ,   baby   2   hated   them ...   i   had   these   with   my   son   and   he   loved   them .   i   just   got   some   when   i   had   my   daughter   in   january   and   she   wants   nothing   to   do   with   them .   i   don   t   think   it   is   because   they   are   bad   binkies ,   i   just   think   she   is   picky .   i   would   at   least   try   them   out   if   you   are   considering   them .   i   bought   8   brands   and   found   what   would   work   when   i   had   both   of   my   babies   and   it   is   proven   that   every   child   is   different .
perfect !   this   has   saved   my   life .   our   newborn   couldn   t   keep   his   binky   in   his   mouth   but   wanted   it   so   we   would   have   to   sit   beside   him   and   put   it   back   in   every   5min .   with   this   it   weighs   just   enough   to   keep   it   in   his   mouth   but   light   enough   that   if   he   doesn   t   want   it   he   spits   it   out   or   just   turns   his   head   and   it   s   out .   now   at   3mths   he   holds   onto   it   and   falls   asleep ... it   s   so   cute .   he   can   even   put   it   back   in   his   mouth
not   all   babies   love   it   i   ordered   this   5   pk   thinking   that   my   newborn   would   like   it   because   he   seems   to   favor   the   soothies   the   best .   i   chose   this   one   because   of   all   the   great   reviews   but   unfortunately ,   my   baby   must   fall   into   the   small   group   who   doesn   t   really   care   for   it .   the   nipple   is   slightly   smaller   than   a   soothie   which   he   still   spits   out ,   that   s   why   i   tried   this   one   .   overall ,   seems   like   a   good   pacifier   if   your   little   one   is   willing   to   take   it ...   but   be   forewarned ,   not   all   babies   will   love   it .
adorable   and   functional   we   bought   this   for   our   daughter   to   use   solely   in   her   crib ,   so   when   she   dropped   her   paci   at   night ,   it   would   be   easier   for   her   to   find .   this   product   certainly   did   the   trick .   the   reason   i   m   giving   it   4   stars   instead   of   5   is   because   when   we   first   got   it ,   she   found   it   a   bit   difficult   to   get   the   actual   pacifier   part   in   her   mouth .   this   is   because   the   paci   is   attached   to   a   little   piece   of   fabric   rather   than   directly   onto   the   caterpiller   ,   so   it   s   wobbly .   now   that   she   s   older   and   has   better   dexterity   with   her   fingers ,   it   s   no   problem .   i   ve   also   discovered   that   using   this   has   helped   her   learn   how   to   get   her   pacifiers   without   the   attached   animal   in   her   mouth ,   too .
great   product ,   not   traditional   boy   colors   ,   but   that   s   ok   with   me !   these   are   my   8   month   old   son   s   favorite   binkies ,   and   i   do   a   great   deal   of   online   shopping   for   the   convenience   factor !   i   ordered   boy   colors   and   received   bright   pink   and   purple .   i   happen   to   not   care   about   the   typical   boy   or   girl   colors   so   it   wasn   t   an   issue   for   me .   people   have   commented ,   and   i   just   say ,   pink   is   his   favorite   color ! ,   and   laugh !   i   will   order   these   again ,   as   my   son   seems   to   wear   them   out   with   regularity .
i   like ,   baby   does   not ...   neat   set   of   pacifiers .   there   are   two   of   them   that   come   in   a   box .   i   expected   just   one   and   that   was   a   welcome   surprise .   our   baby   was   taking   the   gumdrop   infant   pacifier   and   this   one   is   a   bit   bigger   and   flatter ,   so   he   won   t   take   it .   gets   a   bit   stressed   whenever   we   put   it   in   his   mouth .   so   we   have   continued   with   the   infant   pacifier   for   now .   however ,   i   intend   to   slowly   introduce   it   to   him   on   a   daily   basis   till   he   is   comfortable   with   it .   we   got   the   transparent   ones .   looks   great ...   good   quality   material .
they   smell   so   deliciously   tasty   they   smell   so   good   i   could   eat   them ,   i   smelt   the   bag   for   a   good   20mins   same   with   my   husband .   br   they   were   a   little   big   for   my   son   when   he   arrived   but   soon   grew   into   them ,   he   loves   the   smell   of   them .   br   sadly   they   lose   the   smell   once   they   get   washed , mine   did   anyway . even   without   the   wonderful   smell   they   are   a   wonderful   product .
love   it !   i   love   these   pacifiers !   they   are   like   the   soothie   only   a   little   firmer   and   they   don   t   block   the   baby   s   nose .   good   for   a   baby   over   3   months .
great   pacifier   this   is   the   only   pacifier   my   granddaughter   would   take .   we   loved   the   scent   and   she   loved   the   taste   of   it .   we   went   thru   several !   great   size   and   perfect   fit   for   her   mouth .
my   baby   girl   loves   these .   this   is   the   only   binky   my   baby   girl   will   take !   i   love   that   they   have   a   plasic   cover   so   i   don   t   have   to   worry   about   them   getting   dirty .
everyone   s   favorite   no   need   to   constantly   reposition   soothie   pacifier   in   baby   s   mouth   every   5   seconds   or   chase   it   across   the   room   when   it   rolls   away ,   and   its   easy   to   find !   my   baby   has   loved   it   from   day   1   at   age   3   weeks ,   and   it   is   a   source   of   curiousity   and   amazement   among   adults   and   other   parents .   it   really   does   help   baby   get   the   pacifier   in   his   mouth   on   his   own   and   makes   it   available   to   him   if   you   re   not   there   to   give   it   to   him   eg   when   riding   in   the   car ,   clifford   the   dog   sits   on   his   chest   and   he   tilts   his   head   forward   and   grabs   the   paci   with   his   mouth   .   excellent   product !   i   hand   wash   with   my   bras   in   a   natural   detergent ,   wrings   out   fast .   looks   adorable   in   photos   too .
serves   the   purpose   this   is   a   great   little   pacifier   box .   it   fits   well   on   a   diaper   bag   shoulder   strap ,   or   my   handbag .   it   snaps   shut   tightly   so   there   is   no   fear   of   the   pacifier   falling   out .   some   people   say   it   holds   two   pacifiers ,   but   i   guess   it   depends   on   the   pacifier   size .   it   would   hold   two   tiny   ones ,   but   i   have   the   playtex   ones   with   the   little   handle ,   and   fitting   two   inside   this   box   is   a   real   tight   squeeze .   one   of   them   fit   perfectly   though .   overall ,   its   a   great   pacifier   carry   box   and   does   the   job !
love   it   these   are   the   only   binkies   my   son   will   use !   he   does   not   like   the   big   plastic   things   on   other   ones   around   his   mouth .   he   is   four   months   old   and   we   have   tried   the   mam   for   two   months   plus   and   he   will   tolerate   them .   however ,   he   really   likes   these   ones .   it   is   hard   to   find   this   size   in   the   stores   so   we   appreciate   that   amazon   has   them .
colors   may   vary   i   love   these   pacifiers   because   they   have   a   cover   that   snaps   on   them   to   keep   them   clean   while   tumbling   around   in   the   diaper   bag .   they   also   have   the   handle   to   be   able   to   hold   them   without   touching   the   nipple .   my   baby   hasn   t   decided   if   she   loves   them   yet ,   but   that   doesn   t   stop   me   from   loving   them !   the   only   thing   i   don   t   like   is   that   you   can   t   pick   the   color   here .   colors   and   designs   may   vary .   i   received   a   yellow   one   and   a   blue   one   in   my   package .   they   were   not   as   girly   as   i   wanted   for   my   girl .   it   may   be   safer   to   buy   them   in   a   store   and   choose   your   colors .
sent   wrong   item   size   from   another   country   the   pacifiers   sent   are   not   the   pacifiers   pictured .   these   are   a   different   name ,   made   in   another   country   and   the   wrong   size .   customer   service   could   not   be   made   to   understand   that   just   because   an   item   is   made   by   the   same   company   it   is   not   the   same   item .   different   markets   have   different   items   sizes .   bottom   line   is   you   no   longer   carry   a   staple   item   i   purchase   regularly   for   my   2   kids .   i   can   not   be   sure   you   will   not   send   me   the   wrong   item   again   so   i   am   buying   from   another   source   now .
same   pacifier   you   get   in   the   hospital   this   is   the   same   kind   of   pacifier   you   get   in   the   hospital   and   there   is   a   reason   for   this   newborns   prefer   this   one .   as   a   first   time   parent   to   be   i   bought ,   and   was   given   several   different   types   of   pacifiers   of   course   my   son   s   favorite   is   the   one   we   have   only   one   of   the   one   he   went   home   with   from   the   hospital .   i   tried   to   get   him   to   take   another   one ,   since   i   was   afraid   we   d   loose   this   one   plus   it   s   huge ,   and   covers   his   cute   little   face   so   i   wanted   him   to   try   the   smaller   clear   one .... no   way   he   said !   .   it   was   tough   finding   these   in   stores   so   i   resorted   to   amazon   and   bought   several   so   we   will   never   be   without !
my   son   loves   this   what   a   great   product .   we   started   using   this   when   my   baby   was   3   weeks   old   he   s   now   7   weeks   old   and   couldn   t   keep   the   pacifier   in   his   mouth ,   no   it   will   not   completely   keep   it   from   falling   off ,   if   baby   doesn   t   want   it   he   definitely   spits   it   out ,   but   it   does   helps   the   pacifier   to   stay   in .   one   thing   i   loved   about   this   is   the   fact   that   we   can   stick   the   arms   of   the   little   bear   through   the   straps   in   his   car   seat   between   baby   s   chest   and   the   straps   and   it   holds   it   perfectly   in   place   for   the   car   ride ,   so   i   don   t   have   to   keep   reaching   back   to   put   the   pacifier   back   in   my   baby   s   mouth .
love   it ! ! !   i   bought   a   binkibear   as   a   gift   for   a   baby   shower   and   the   mom   to   be   loved   it ! ! !   it   is   super   soft   and   the   perfect   size   for   little   hands .   i   wish   this   would   have   been   around   when   my   kids   were   younger !   you   won   t   be   disappointed ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
too   heavy   and   bulky .   my   baby   hates   it !   my   baby   love   the   newborn   soothie   pacifier , ... but   hates   this   one .   it   is   bulky   and   way   too   heavy .   it   won   t   stay   in   his   mouth .   too   bad !
great   baby   shower   gift !   wubbanubs   are   so   great   for   newborns   because   they   can   easily   put   them   back   into   their   mouth   after   they   have   lost   them .   they   also   give   them   a   comfort   item   close   to   them .   i   buy   them   for   all   of   my   friends   with   babies !
can   t   live   without   a   wubbanub   if   you   haven   t   tried   a   wubbanub   for   an   infant   or   toddler   who   likes   or   needs   a   pacifier ,   you   are   missing   out .   they   are   cute ,   durable ,   easy   to   hold ,   and   keep   the   paci   close   at   hand .
great   item ,   great   quality   i   got   the   wubbanub   in   the   mail   two   days   ago   and   i   am   already   in   love   with   it .   this   is   something   i   wish   would   have   been   around   a   long   time   ago   when   i   first   started   having   kids !   br   br   i   did   mistakenly   by   extra   pacifiers   thinking   that   they   were   replaceable   interchangeable ,   they   re   not .   i   can   t   complain   about   an   assumption   i   made   though ,   so   i   still   give   this   wonderful   product   5   stars .
best   pacifier   ! !   worth   the   money   this   is   the   easiest   pacifier   for   my   daughter   to   latch   onto .   very   soft   unlike   the   orthodontic   pacifier .   last   for   a   long   time .   have   had   mine   2   1   2   years   and   it   is   showing   no   sign   of   wearing   down .   would   recommend   this   to   anyone .
logo   wears   off   these   puppies   work   good   and   my   little   one   likes   them .   my   only   gripe   is   that   the   logo   wears   off   quickly .
great   baby   products   i   use   these   for   baby   wreaths .   parents   love   em   and   they   re   great   for   teaching   a   baby   to   hold   things   at   an   early   age .   i   ve   been   told   they   help   with   bottle   holding   too   and   i   just   adored   this   little   dragon .
great   baby   products   i   use   these   for   baby   wreaths .   they   re   very   durable   and   i   have   yet   to   receive   any   complaints   from   new   parents .   they   re   so   cute   and   meant   to   teach   babies   to   hold   things   such   as   there   bottles   sooner .
best   pacifier   ever !   i   love   this ! ! !   my   son   is   3   mo .   he   loves   playing   with   the   giraffe .   it   is   nice   because   he   can   try   to   put   it   in   his   mouth   all   by   himself .   i   never   lose   the   pacifer   since   it   is   attached ,   and   it   has   less   of   a   chance   to   roll   and   fall   on   the   ground .   i   will   be   buying   another   one   in   the   near   future .
funny   and   non   traditional   gift   i   gave   this   pacifier   to   my   friend   who   love   heavy   metal   and   hard   rock .   his   baby   got   al   those   cute   things   from   winnie   the   pooh ,   flowers   and   butterfly .   i   wanted   something   that   remains   her   dad .   pacifier   rocks !
great   pacifier .   my   son   loves   mam   pacifier   and   refused   other   brand   i   ve   tried .   he   is   now   over   3   months   and   i   have   a   bigger   size   2   months .   the   nipple   is   the   same   size   like   0   3   months   size ,   only   the   front   part   i   call   it   butterfly   is   bigger .   he   likes   both   sizes .
totally   cute !   haha ,   this   item   was   almost   more   for   me   than   for   my   daughter .   she   only   likes   the   soothies   but   i   think   they   are   ugly .   anyway ,   i   heard   about   these   wubbanubs   and   got   totally   excited .   got   it   just   today   and   my   daughter   loves   it   too .   it   helps   keep   it   in   her   mouth   without   always   falling   out   when   she   drifts   off   for   a   bit .   its   very   cute   and   she   likes   to   hold   on   to   the   kitty   s   leg   while   she   sucks   on   the   soothie .   she   is   3   weeks   old .   we   are   pleased .   d
too   much   this   is   a   pacifier   they   gave   me   in   the   hospital .   my   daughtr   loved   it   so   i   ordered   more .   they   are   similar   to   other   pacis   and   way   over   .   i   switched   to   closer   to   nature   n   she   loves   then   the   same
love   love   love   these !   i   love   these   so   much   that   i   even   sent   some   to   my   friend   back   home   in   the   uk   because   she   thought   the   big   american   soothie   pacifiers   looked   ridiculous ,   and   couldn   t   believe   they   would   make   one   that   would   cover   a   baby   s   nose .   anyway ,   i   think   they   are   wonderful .   exact   same   nipple   shape   as   the   soothie ,   but   with   room   to   breathe !   my   son   doesn   t   have   a   problem   with   them   either .   i   particularly   like   that ,   with   this   particular   nipple   shape ,   he   doesn   t   really   hold   onto   it   for   too   long ,   and   just   sucks   until   he   s   pacified   then   spits   it   out .   i   don   t   foresee   pacifier   addiction   in   our   future .   can   t   recommend   it   highly   enough ,   and   this   is   the   best   price   around !
note   the   brand   name   i   bought   these   pacifiers   off   the   shelf   not   giving   any   notice   to   the   brand .   the   original   maker   of   this   design   is   the   first   years ,   not   avent .   so   when   i   saw   this   on   the   shelf ,   i   was   misled   because   phillips   avent   is   making   a   pacifier   which   looks   exactly   like   the   green   pacifier   that   first   years   used   to   make .   this   may   not   be   a   big   deal   to   anyone   else   or   their   baby   ,   but   my   baby   knew   the   difference   wanted   nothing   to   do   with   the   avent   brand   paci .   when   i   compared   the   two ,   i   noticed   that   the   avent   brand   paci   was   slightly   harder   than   the   first   years   brand .   with   the   first   years ,   my   baby   could   chomp   down   easier   get   better   suction   too .   our   hospital   gave   out   the   first   years   brand ,   and   that   is   all   my   daughter   will   take   now .   at   4   months   old ,   this   particular   brand   did   not   work   for   us ,   but   that   doesn   t   mean   it   won   t   work   for   you .   but   if   your   baby   is   picky ,   i   would   stick   to   the   original   brand   if   you   know   that   s   what   s   he   likes .   br   br   note   though   she   always   prefers   her   green   first   years   brand ,   now   at   9   months ,   baby   is   accepting   the   avent   brand .   br   br   update   first   years   does   not   make   this   paci   at   all   anymore .   it   seems   avent   has   the   manufacturing   rights .   br   my   original   review   of   this   product   is   a   bit   old .   i   want   to   say   that   the   green   pacifiers   have   been   great ,   and   of   all   the   ones   on   the   market ,   this   is   the   only   one   she   will   take ...   even   if   there   was   a   small   adjustment   period   when   the   new   brand   took   over .   i   think   it   s   important   to   note   that   the   0   3   months   pacifiers   are   preferable   to   her   because   they   are   softer .   when   i   tried   buying   the   paci   for   older   babies ,   she   spit   it   out   simply   could   not   get   good   suction .   it   seemed   too   hard   uncomfortable   for   her .   anyway ,   at   18   months   old ,   she   was   still   using   this   green   0   3   month   paci ,   and   we   will   ween   her   off   the   paci   soon .   right   now   it   s   a   great   soother   while   she   is   teething ,   as   nothing   else   works .   i   do   believe   though ,   that   the   shape   of   the   nipple   on   this   paci   has   caused   her   front   teeth   to   grow   inpronounced   curve   shape .
best   pacifier   this   is   the   only   pacifier   our   son   would   take .   we   have   tried   the   soothies   and   nuk   brands ,   but   he   would   just   spit   them   out .   they   have   a   cute   design   and   i   love   the   pacifier   cover   that   comes   with   it !
pacifiers   we   bought   these   pacifiers   because   they   had   a   hole   in   the   end   for   a   clip .   although   they   are   still   not   as   good   as   the   soothies   we   managed   to   get   our   son   to   take   them   and   he   will   use   them   during   the   day   when   we   are   out   and   about   so   i   don   t   have   to   worry   about   him   throwing   his   pacifer   out   of   his   stroller .   however ,   any   time   at   home   or   for   naps   bed   time   he   still   prefers   the   soothie .
love ,   love ,   love   these   my   daughter   refused   every   other   pacifier   until   i   found   these .   i   also   use   the   playtex   drop   ins   for   bottles   which   most   simulates   the   nipples   for   breastfeeding   and   so   do   these   pacifiers .   my   daughter   has   a   tiny   mouth   and   love ,   love ,   loves   these !   we   got   a   sample   with   the   playtex   bottle   kit   and   ordered   some   on   line   asap !   hard   to   find   in   the   stores .
not   spit   proof   but   helps   tremendously   the   wubbanub   is   definitely   not   spit   proof   but   it   does   help   in   keeping   the   pacifier   in   baby   s   mouth .   it   works   best   at   night   when   she   s   swaddled   and   can   t   move   around   too   much ,   and   i   can   just   rest   it   on   her   chest .   it   s   easy   to   find   if   she   does   end   up   spitting   it   out .
too   bad   i   can   t   find   this   in   stores !   my   8   month   old   grandson   loves   this   binky   i   m   just   sorry   i   couldn   t   find   the   larger   size   in   stores   locally .
love   it   i   love   wubbanubs !   they   are   amazing !   they   don   t   stay   in   your   babies   mouth   unless   they   are   holding   it   in   so   no   worry   about   them   choking   on   it .   it   is   very   safe !   it   is   simply   just   a   very   cute   soothe   pacifier !   if   your   little   one   loves   the   soothe   then   get   this !   it   makes   the   pacifier   so   easy   to   find   and   as   your   little   one   gets   older   it   is   also   a   little   stuffed   animal   they   can   take   along .   honestly   when   the   pacifier   gets   worn   out   you   can   just   cut   it   out   and   sew   a   new   soothe   in .   i   also   have   thrown   this   in   the   dishwasher   and   washing   machine .   it   holds   up   great ! !
breastfed   baby   was   hoping   to   find   a   pacifier   that   my   guy   would   take .... he   is   almost   3   months   old   and   still   wants   to   nurse   every   2   hours   around   the   clock ,   and   i   have   a   sneakin   suspicion   that   it   is   not   all   nutritive   nursing ! ! !   unfortunately ,   this   was   not   the   one .   seems   big   and   heavy .   otherwise ,   material   and   construction   seem   just   fine .
lifesaver   in   the   car   my   daughter   doesn   t   really   like   pacifiers   and   has   a   very   difficult   time   keeping   them   in   her   mouth ,   but   while   in   the   car ,   this   has   been   a   lifesaver   because   it   is   small   and   better   shaped   than   most   other   pacifiers   prob   the   reason   they   give   them   to   you   in   the   hospital   also ,   it   has   the   hole   where   you   can   stick   your   finger   to   help   your   baby   keep   it   in   their   mouths .   when   she   got   older   and   was   teething ,   she   sucked   on   the   paci   my   finger   so   hard ,   but   it   worked   great   for   her .   br   br   downside   is   that   there   is   no   place   to   hook   a   holder   to   it ,   so   we   lost   it   quite   a   bit   thank   god   for   bottled   water   to   clean   it   on   the   go !  
best   pacifier   on   the   market   hands   down !   i   love   wubbanubs !   it   is   simply   just   a   very   cute   soothe   pacifier !   if   your   little   one   loves   the   soothe   then   get   this !   it   makes   the   pacifier   so   easy   to   find   and   as   your   little   one   gets   older   it   is   also   a   little   stuffed   animal   they   can   take   along .   honestly   when   the   pacifier   gets   worn   out   you   can   just   cut   it   out   and   sew   a   new   soothe   in .   i   also   have   thrown   this   in   the   dishwasher   and   washing   machine .   it   holds   up   great ! !
adorable ! !   my   son   loves   to   hold   on   to   the   giraffe   even   when   he   is   not   sucking   on   the   pacifier .   it   s   so   cute !   i   gave   it   four   stars   because   i   have   no   idea   why   these   cost   so   much ! !
highly   recommend .   my   daughter   loves   it !   my   daughter   rejected   all   pacifiers   except   this   one .   it   is   the   only   thing   that   soothes   her   and   gets   her   to   sleep ... she   sucks   the   pacifier   while   hugging   the   monkey   and   stroking   his   arms .   it   is   a   genius   product   that   has   been   a   lifesaver   for   me .   well   worth   the   money ! !
wish   there   was   cutout   for   nose   on   both   top   and   bottom .   our   twins   love   these   pacifiers .   the   handle   is   the   part   that   glows   in   the   dark   not   the   whole   pacifier   .   this   feature   makes   it   easy   to   find   the   pacifier   if   it   falls   out   within   the   first   hour   of   putting   the   babies   to   bed .   my   only   complaint   about   the   pacifiers   is   that   there   s   a   nose   cutout   only   on   the   top ,   but   the   babies   are   old   enough   to   put   the   pacifiers   in   and   take   them   out   on   their   own ,   and   the   babies   don   t   know   there   s   a   right   way ....   so   the   pacifiers   end   up   upside   down   about   half   the   time   and   slightly   poking   them   in   the   nose .   other   than   that   the   pacifiers   are   great .   we   boil   them   on   occasion   to   sterilize .
eh ..   small   it   s   smaller   than   i   thought   it   was   going   to   be .   i   m   only   now   starting   to   buy   stuff   for   the   baby   we   are   expecting .   i   had   some   newborn   pacifiers   and   wanted   to   see   how   they   were   going   to   fit .   two   gumdrop   pacifiers   fit   crammed   in   there .   but   basically   this   is   only   big   enough   for   one   pacifier .   it   s   cute   though ..   and   probably   will   come   in   handy   for   sure .
wubbanub   caterpillar   product   got   lost   in   the   mail   and   they   were   great   about   sending   out   another   one .   the   product   was   just   as   promised   and   i   would   definately   do   business   with   them   again .  
must   have   pacifier   wipes   are   a   must   have .   i   don   t   know   about   you   but   my   baby   is   always   dropping   his   pacifier   or   sometimes   i   feel   like   it   just   needs   washed   off .   i   love   these   for   when   we   are   out   and   not   where   i   can   easly   give   it   a   wash .   i   keep   a   package   in   my   diaper   bag ,   one   at   home ,   one   at   grandma   s   house   and   one   in   the   car .
never   lose   the   pacifier   these   are   great   pacifiers .   my   two   and   half   month   old   daughter   loves   them !   we   tried   several   brands   like   mam ,   nuk ,   munchkin   and   dr .   brown   s .   at   first   we   thought   dr .   brown   s   would   work   better   because   we   use   their   bottle   system .   she   likes   dr .   brown   s   but   she   likes   mam   even   better .   mam   s   pacifiers   look   very   cute   and   we   also   combine   with   the   pacifier   clips .   the   clips   have   bright   color   so   you   can   easily   identify   where   it   is   and   the   flexible   clip   allows   you   to   adjust   the   tightness   to   thickness   of   baby   clothes   easily .   we   are   very   satisfied   with   the   purchase   and   highly   recommend   these   pacifiers   to   all   new   parents .
great   pacifier   my   son   has   been   using   these   pacifiers   and   they   work   great .   he   has   had   no   problems   with   nipple   confusion   or   breastfeeding .   my   only   con   is   that   he   will   gag   on   it   every   so   often .   i   don   t   know   if   he   has   a   small   mouth   or   if   the   nipple   is   too   long .   i   do   recommend   these   though ,   they   re   great .
baby   s   preferred   paci   we   have   a   box   full   of   pacifiers   for   our   2   month   old   daughter ,   and   one   nuk   genius   we   received   as   a   shower   gift ...   and ,   of   course ,   it   s   the   nuk   genius   the   one   pacifier   that   we   are   unable   to   find   at   any   of   our   local   stores   that   she   truly   loves .   we   recently   temporarily   lost   our   only   nuk   genius   pacifier ,   and   were   forced   to   order   another   on   amazon ,   balking   slightly   at   the   5   price ...   but   with   her   stubborn   insistence ,   we   went   ahead   and   ordered   it ,   deciding   that   5   is   not   so   much   for   household   peace ...   we   found   the   original   pacifier   we   already   owned ,   so   now   we   have   two ,   and   are   already   considering   buying   a   few   more ...   just   in   case .
easy   to   find   during   the   night   this   product   is   great !   my   son   loves   it   and   it   is   easy   for   him   to   find   in   the   middle   of   the   night .   he   also   tends   to   throw   his   pacifiers   out   of   the   crib   before   going   to   sleep ,   so   this   one   is   easy   to   find   and   put   back   in   the   crib   because   it   doesn   t   bounce .   the   people   at   my   son   s   daycare   love   it   too !   everyone   has   a   similar   pacifier   and   it   is   hard   to   mark   them ... this   one   is   a   one   of   a   kind   there .
great   prod ,   but   water   seeps   in   the   nipple   and   can   t   come   out   its   got   great   quality   material .   few   things   i   don   t   like   about   it   is   the   color   of   the   lips   is   not   natural   looking ,   but   it   would   ve   not   affected   my   decision   of   buying   it   if   i   ve   seen   one   in   person   before   buying   it .   this   pacifier   made   people   laugh   inspite   of   it .   when   washing   it ,   water   seeps   inside   the   nipple   and   baby   could   drink   that   stagnant   dirty   water .
wubbanubs   are   awesome   the   caterpillar   wubbanub   is   even   more   adorable   in   person   than   on   the   website .   my   daughter   loves   to   hold   it   and   it   allows   her   to   be   able   to   keep   her   soothie   close   by .   the   only   thing   i   didn   t   expect   was   that   this   wubbanub   has   a   lemony   scent .   neither   me   nor   my   daughter   are   bothered   by   this ,   but   those   of   you   who   are   sensitive   to   smells   may   be   put   off   by   this .   i   would   highly   recommend   this   product   and   have   already !
love   them !   i   tryed   all   binkies   out   there   and   this   is   the   one   she   and   i   both   liked .   its   no   weird   shaped   and   she   likes   it .   she   is   solely   brestfed   and   wont   take   anything   silcone   and   she   loves   these !
works   very   well   and   completely   satisfied !   i   have   had   this   thermometer   for   a   few   months   now   and   have   enjoyed   using   it ,   and   it   only   takes   a   couple   of   seconds   to   get   an   accurate   reading .   read   the   directions ,   become   acquainted   with   it   and   you   will   be   very   satisfied   as   i   have   been .
awkward   and   clunky ,   but   baby   still   sometimes   uses   it .   this   product   was   much   larger   than   what   i   expected .   she   s   still   teething   and   it   provides   two   or   three   minutes   of   relief   if   i   can   get   her   interested   in   it .   she   doesn   t   suck   on   the   nipple   part   because   it   s   too   heavy   and   falls   out   of   her   mouth .   i   wouldn   t   pay   as   much   as   i   did   if   i   had   to   do   it   over   again   because   it   doesn   t   see   much   use .
amazing   discovery   this   pacifier   is   the   only   one   my   daughter   will   take .   we   didn   t   accept   pacifiers   at   the   hospital   as   we   wanted   to   make   sure   she   latched   on   for   breastfeeding .   when   we   came   home ,   she   wouldn   t   take   any   pacifier   that   i   registered   for .   i   ordered   this   after   the   great   reveiw   and   others   saying   they   loved   the   ones   from   the   hospital .   our   baby   took   it   right   away   and   it   is   a   savor   for   soothing   her !
diaper   bag   must   have !   how   many   times   does   your   baby   drop   their   pacifier ,   are   screaming ,   and   you   have   that   moment   of   well   if   i   just   wipe   in   on   my   pant   leg   it   ll   be   clean   enough   and   it   s   not   going   to   kill   them .   these   are   a   must   have   in   your   diaper   bag   so   you   can   clean   them   properly   before   returning   them   to   your   baby   s   mouth .   they   also   have   a   nice   smell   and   don   t   leave   a   poor   after   taste   as   my   son   takes   his   pacifier   immediately   after   it   s   cleaned   with   these   wipes .
durable ,   easy   to   clean ,   rec   d   to   us   by   lactation   consultant   unlike   many   other   pacifiers ,   these   are   made   of   a   single   piece   of   silicone ,   which   eliminates   most   potential   choking   hazards .   in   addition ,   being   made   of   a   single   piece   of   silicone   means   they   are   really   easy   to   clean ,   which   is   extremely   important ,   and   they   dry   thoroughly   and   quickly .   you   can   even   boil   them   to   sterilize   them .   other   types   of   pacifiers   we   ve   tried   ended   up   with   condensation   water   droplets   stuck   inside   them ...   no   good .   also ,   if   you   are   concerned   about   nursing   issues ,   that   shouldn   t   be   a   problem   with   these   pacifiers .   they   were   recommended   to   us   by   a   registered   nurse   who   is   also   a   lactation   consultant .   incidentally ,   she   was   not   a   fan   of   the   orthodontic   pacifiers .   fyi ,   these   pacifiers   work   well   with   the   booginhead   pacifier   holder .
love   these ! ! !   my   daughter   has   been   using   the   original   gumdrop   pacifiers   since   she   was   a   month   old   and   we   do   also   have   a   few   soothies   just   for   back   up   even   though   those   aren   t   her   favorite ...   she   is   now   almost   19   months   old   and   just   gets   the   pacifiers   for   bedtime   and   naptime   and   she   also   teethes   on   them ....   the   gumdrops   are   really   wearing   and   not   holding   up   well   i   know   we   ve   been   using   them   awhile   but   we   ve   had   14   of   the   gumdrops   ....   when   i   ordered   these   first   years   gumdrops   i   didn   t   realize   that   i   was   ordering   something   different   than   the   original   gumdrops ...   when   they   came   in   the   mail   today   i   noticed   that   they   seem   alot   more   sturdy   and   durable   than   the   original   gumdrops ! ...   now   we   just   got   them   today   but   i   think   i   like   them   better   than   the   original   just   because   the   material   seems   like   it   will   hold   up   better   and   my   daughter   was   very   excited   to   get   them   in   the   mail   too ,   she   didn   t   seem   to   notice   a   difference !   also   i   accidentally   ordered   a   newborn   pack   as   well   as   an   infant   pack   but   i   really   don   t   see   a   difference ....   possibly   the   original   gumdrops   would   be   better   for   a   newborn   and   baby   who   is   not   teething   ...   but   i   would   definitely   recommend   these ,   especially   once   babies   are   getting   teeth !
great   paci   bought   these   for   my   new   little   one   and   never   once   has   he   had   any   issues   taking   them .   they   smell   great   and   are   a   big   hit .   i   am   bf   and   he   has   had   no   problems   with   latching .
great   pacifiers   these   really   are   great   pacifiers .   they   are   slightly   longer   making   it   easier   for   your   infant   to   latch   plus   you   can   t   beat   the   holder   that   it   comes   with   that   latches   on   easily   and   securely   which   is   great   for   travel .
not   exactly   like   the   hospital   paci   s .   while   these   are   a   cute   alternative   to   the   hospital   paci   s   still   our   favorite   i   refuse   to   buy   decorative   pacifiers   ... they   are   not   an   exact   replica .   i   do   think   this   has   helped   us   lessen   our   reliance   on   paci   s   altogether ,   which   is   my   ultimate   goal   by   one   year   old .   liz   davis   6   mos .  
pasi   sewn   together   with   animal   i   just   adored   this   when   i   got   it .   it   was   cute   and   i   understood   it   s   function   from   the   beginning   beyond   just   having   a   pasi .   however   it   wasn   t   until   i   opened   the   package   yesterday   that   i   was   disappointed   i   m   due   soon   the   directions   say   to   wash   the   pasi   got   it ,   no   biggie .   the   animal   wash   gentle   dry   low ,   got   it .   then   as   i   was   inspecting   the   product   i   realized   the   animal   is   sewn   together   with   the   pasi .   br   br   this   didn   t   make   sense   to   me .   so   you   re   supposed   to   wash   the   animal   in   the   washer ,   with   the   pasi   attached   to   it ,   allowing   any   soap   you   might   use   in   the   washer   to   soak   into   the   pasi .   or   you   could   not   use   any   detergent   but   either   way   i   m   sure   the   pasi   can   t   be   washed   in   a   washer   too   frequently .   br   br   you   can   t   remove   or   reattach   the   pasi   unless   you   take   the   stitch   out   and   then   restitch   the   or   a   new   pasi   into   the   mouth   of   the   animal .   i   was   expecting   some   clip   or   tie   or   something   else   other   than   permanent   attachment   of   the   two   objects   for   cleaning   purposes   this   is   completely   unpractical .   br   br   i   gave   it   two   stars   instead   of   just   one   because   it   is   adorable .   it   is   another   baby   item   that   may   or   may   not   work   depending   on   how   my   child   takes   it .   the   rating   is   not   based   upon   if   my   kid   throws   it   or   not   because   that   would   defeat   the   purpose   of   rating   the   product   as   it   is   verses   what   my   kid   does   with   it .
so   many   chemicals !   i   was   expecting   something   that   would   be   made   of   natural   ingredients   especially   since   it   is   used   on   something   that   my   baby   puts   in   her   mouth .   after   using   a   wipe   i   feel   like   i   needed   to   rinse   that   off   too .   would   only   use   wherever   water   is   available   to   rinse   off   the   residue   from   the   wipe .
best   pacifiers   these   are   the   only   pacifiers   my   little   guy   will   use   i   love   they   re   size   they   don   t   block   his   whole   face   and   also   i   love   how   they   always   seems   to   fall   facing   up   i   m   not   sure   why   but   it   helps   when   he   drops   them !  
love   it !   the   wubbanub   keeps   the   paci   from   disaappearing   in   the   carseat ,   helps   keep   paci   in   baby   s   mouth ... if   it   falls   out   my   son   is   able   to   put   it   back   in   his   mouth   easily ,   the   monkey   is   so   cute   and   is   perfect   size   for   baby   s   hands .   my   son   enjoys   holding   it   in   his   hands   while   he   sucks   his   paci   it   helps   soothe   him   to   sleep ... he   has   become   pretty   attached   to   his   wubbanub   already .
excellent   pacifier   size   is   larger   than   0   6   month   while   there   is   no   detectable   difference   between   the   0   3   month   pacifier   by   avent   and   their   0   6   month   pacifier ,   the   6   18   month   pacifier   is   noticably   larger .   i   made   the   switch   from   0   6   to   6   18   at   10   months   and   neither   of   my   twins   seems   to   notice   a   difference .   it   was   time   for   fresh   pacifiers   anyhow ...
great   product   after   surgery   so ,   when   i   saw   this   product   i   loved   it !   but   i   knew   that   my   3   month   old   baby   would   hate   the   pacifier   part .   the   only   paci   she   ever   takes   is   the   nam   kind   because   they   have   bigger   bulbs   at   the   end   for   her   to   suck   on .   also ,   other   pacifiers   are   shaped   too   similarly   to   her   milk   bottles   and   she   gets   mad   that   milk   doesn   t   come   out   of   them .   i   also   wasn   t   thrilled   that   you   had   to   wash   the   paci   with   the   toy .   so   being   a   crafty   mom ,   i   knew   i   could   fix   this   so   she   would   like   it .   i   got   it   in   the   mail   yesterday   and   as   i   predicted   she   just   spit   it   out .   so   i   took   my   seam   ripper   and   got   the   pacifier   off   easily   without   hurting   the   toy .   then   i   took   one   of   the   holders   for   the   nam   which   come   apart   and   there   is   a   hole   at   the   end   where   the   tie   for   the   clip   goes   through   it   was   the   perfect   size   for   the   hole   i   had   made .   a   few   stitches   and   viola !   popped   the   pacifier   in   the   holder   i   also   like   that   it   can   spin   around   in   the   holder   and   we   were   good   to   go .   she   had   been   crying   for   about   15   mins ,   i   put   it   in   her   mouth ,   showed   her   how   she   could   grab   on   to   it   and   she   was   sleeping   within   minutes .   she   has   fallen   asleep   with   it   4   times   since   then .   so ,   like   i   said   i   loved   the   idea   of   this   product   but   had   to   make   it   work   for   me .   just   an   idea   for   some   of   you   other   crafty   moms   or   dads   out   there  
small   i   was   disappointed   in   this .   it   claims   to   accommodate   2   pacifiers   but   i   could   barely   get   one   in .   i   am   using   the   soothie   pacifiers .
my   kid   hates   this   pacifier   everyone   raves   about   this   pacifier   but   my   daughter   has   hated   it   from   day   one !   she   doesn   t   care   much   for   any   pacifier ,   but   she   disliked   this   one   the   most .   we   re   using   gumdrop   and   nuk   when   she   ll   take   them   .   it   wouldn   t   hurt   to   try   it   though .
great   for   photos   the   puppy   is   really   cute   and   my   newborn   son   loves   it .   it   doesn   t   fall   on   the   floor   so   no   need   for   washes .   the   only   minus   is   that   it   pops   out   easy .
hospital   grade   pacifiers   awesome   we   got   a   green   one   from   the   hospital   and   our   baby   loves   it .   we   figure   we   should   just   stick   with   what   we   have   instead   of   experimenting .   we   found   a   similar   looking   one   by   avent   but   they   weren   t   the   same .   thank   goodness   amazon   has   these .   they   are   exactly   the   same   as   the   one   we   got   from   the   hospital   except   the   color   but   the   engraving   on   the   pacifier   is   all   the   same .   the   color   for   the   blue   ones   is   actually   much   lighter   in   person   than   in   the   picture   more   of   a   transparent   grayish   light   blue   very   pretty   though .   br   br   i   personally   like   how   it   s   one   piece   so   i   don   t   have   to   worry   about   loose   pieces   coming   off   choking   hazard .   the   pacifier   is   really   soft .   i   know   they   make   harder   ones   for   teethers   but   these   are   the   softer   ones   for   newborns   and   non   teething   babies .   it   s   very   easy   to   clean   and   long   lasting .   we   re   actually   still   using   the   green   one   we   got   from   the   hospital   but   having   spares   make   it   easier   if   i   have   to   clean   them   then   i   don   t   have   to   worry   about   not   having   a   pacifier   available   if   it   s   being   sterilized .   i   sterilizes   them   in   boiling   water   and   they   stand   up   to   the   heat   very   well .   br   br   these   pacifiers   does   tend   to   get   stuff   like   lint   and   hair   stuck   on   them   because   of   their   sticky   ish   surface .   i   don   t   use   napkins   or   cloths   with   lots   of   fiber   to   wipe   them   otherwise   they   get   fury .   most   of   the   time   i   just   run   it   through   warm   hot   water   and   maybe   scrub   it   a   little   with   my   hands   then   let   it   air   dry .
only   pacifier   my   baby   will   use .   i   love   these   pacifiers   because   they   are   the   only   ones   my   baby   will   take .   i   ve   tried   several   different   brands   and   types   but   he   only   likes   these .   he   is   breast   feed   and   i   think   these   pacifiers   are   great   because   they   are   similar   to   a   natural   nipple .   i   only   wish   they   were   easier   to   find   in   the   stores .   luckily   amazon   still   sells   them .
love   this   item ,   so   cute !   this   is   such   an   adorable   pacifier   and   has   great   features   too .   one   of   the   best   parts   about   this   pacifier   is   that   i   do   not   have   to   attach   it   to   a   string   pacifier   holder   which   could   get   wrapped   around   my   little   one   ,   i   would   simply   just   rest   it   on   him   and   he   would   push   at   it   if   he   wanted   it .   this   sweet   little   animal   is   light   weight   yet   heavy   enough   to   stay   put   in   a   carseat   or   while   he   sleeps   in   his   bassinet .   this   product   is   great ,   i   have   had   it   for   my   child   since   he   was   born ,   i   gave   it   to   him   about   4   5   days   in   as   a   newborn   which   i   have   come   to   realize   is   the   best   time   to   give   a   pacifier   to   a   newborn ,   it   is   not   too   early   for   nipple   confusion   and   not   too   late   that   they   refuse   it   .   he   has   been   able   to   grasp   at   it   from   day   one .   he   was   able   to   push   the   little   animal   back   in   if   it   started   to   fall   out   or   push   it   out   if   he   did   not   want   it .   the   design   makes   it   easier   to   stay   in   their   mouths   when   they   are   so   little   and   are   learning   to   suck .   it   is   also   easy   to   wash   and   it   drys   quickly .   i   recommend   two   so   that   you   can   always   have   one   ready   to   go .   i   did   see   a   few   other   wubbanub   pacifiers   on   sale   at   babies   r   us ,   but   when   my   friend   purchased   hers   i   noticed   that   the   quality   was   not   as   good ,   they   were   much   more   flimsy   and   very   light   weight ,   making   it   hard   to   stay   put .   when   i   was   still   pregnant   i   wrote ... i   love   this   product ,   it   is   so   precious   and   this   is   the   best   price   i   have   seen   for   these .   my   friends   baby   has   them   and   loves   them   so   much ,   she   is   able   to   grab   it   at   put   it   back   in   her   mouth   herself .   i   am   still   pregnant   and   hoping   that   my   baby   will   love   them   as   much   as   my   friends   baby   did .   i   love   how   soft   they   are   and   they   are   a   good   size ,   not   too   large   and   not   too   small .   gotta   love   the   sweet   white   lamb .
basically   the   same   as   soothies   i   purchased   the   gumdrop   pacifiers   hoping   they   were   a   bit   less   substantial   than   the   soothies   but   they   re   essentially   the   same ,   with   a   slightly   different   shape .   they   still   twist   around   in   my   boy   s   mouth   so   the   sides   end   up   digging   into   his   nose .   they   might   sit   better   once   he   s   older ...   but   i   m   hoping   and   praying   he   stops   using   pacifiers   within   a   few   months !   the   one   plus   is   that   they   don   t   look   as   strange   as   the   soothies .
my   son   loves   it   my   nephew   had   the   frog   wubbanub   and   he   loved   it   so   i   decided   to   register   for   this   one   when   i   was   pregnant .   i   have   to   say   my   son   loves   it ,   he   s   5   and   a   half   weeks   old   and   has   been   using   it   since   day   3 .   luckily   it   didn   t   cause   and   nipple   confusion   for   him .   it   did   start   helping   him   sleep   really   well   through   the   night .   he   loves   holding   onto   the   little   giraffe   and   it   s   really   cute   watching   him .   washing   it   is   the   only   issue ,   what   i   have   done   so   far   is   stick   the   nipple   part   in   the   boiling   water   while   i   m   sterilizing   other   baby   things   but   i   have   read   recently   on   a   forum   that   they   can   be   put   in   the   washer   safely   and   then   you   air   dry   it ,   i   will   have   to   try   that   soon .
beautifull   and   stilish   when   my   daughter   used   this   beautifull   pacifier   she   looks   amaizing ,   not   only   that   but   its   really   comfortable   in   her   mouth .   i   recomend   it .
my   daughter   loves   this   my   daughter   is   2   months   old .   when   she   was   born   they   gave   a   soothie   pacifier   at   the   hospital .   she   won   t   take   any   other   pacifier   and   they   are   easy   to   lose   and   impossible   to   find   in   the   dark .   this   product   is   great   because   you   can   find   it   in   the   dark ,   it   help   to   keep   it   in   easier   by   having   the   monkey   laying   on   her   chest ,   and   when   she   is   not   sucking   on   the   pacifier   she   is   holding   the   monkey .   this   may   be   the   most   valuable   purchase   we   made   for   our   little   addition
love   these   pacifiers !   my   son   loves   these   pacifiers .   i   took   a   chance   an   ordered   two   sets   from   amazon   and   received   two   sets   of   pick   pacifiers   with   peacocks .   this   seems   to   be   what   they   have   been   sending   out   recently   based   on   other   reviews ,   so   if   you   are   wanting   girl   colors   you   might   want   to   give   it   a   go .   i   don   t   mind   that   i   received   pink   and   knew   that   it   was   a   gamble ,   but   probably   would   not   have   ordered   them   if   they   did   not   offer   free   returns .
funny   but   not   effective   i   bought   this   because   the   idea   was   cute .   in   reality ,   this   is   a   heavy   pacifier   and   of   little   to   no   practical   use .   want   to   take   a   few   cute   photos   this   is   a   funny   prop .   want   to   provide   a   pacifier   that   does   its   job ,   there   are   better   choices .
adorable   my   daughter   loves   her   elephant .   she   can   handle   it   on   her   own   and   likes   to   chew   on   the   stuffed   part   while   holding   the   pacifier   part .   it   makes   it   easier   to   find   in   her   carseat   when   she   drops   it   which   makes   car   rides   quieter .   it   s   a   little   expensive ,   but   i   would   buy   another   one   for   the   ease   of   finding   it   when   she   drops   it .   if   your   child   likes   the   soothie   pacifiers ,   i   would   recommend   this .
love   these !   my   daughter   loves   these .   i   m   glad   i   bought   in   bulk   because   they   tend   to   end   up   behind   the   crib   so   it   reduces   the   number   of   escavations   i   have   to   do .
huge ,   covers   face   i   bought   these   for   my   10   month   old .   these   are   the   largest   pacifiers   i   have   ever   seen .   if   i   had   known   they   was   this   large   i   would   not   have   bought .
like   it   wish   i   knew   it   works   i   like   having   this   gizmo .   it   takes   two   pushes   to   get   the   process   to   begin .   when   the   light   goes   on ,   you   just   close   the   top   and   wait .   i   wish   there   was   a   way   to   show   that   the   germs   are   actually   gone .   i   just   trust   that   it   does   what   it   is   supposed   to   do .   it   takes   up   a   bit   of   space   in   the   diaper   bag ,   about   2   fists   worth   but   i   do   have   room   for   it .   it   looks   spacy .   i   wish   it   were   made   to   close   and   throw   it   in   the   bag   to   let   it   work .   i   have   to   set   it   on   a   table   or   so   while   it   is   working .   mine   has   been   around   for   about   a   year   not   w   o   it   breaking .   i   am   glad   to   have   it .   it   definately   gets   attention   and   people   think   i   am   a   cool   mom   in   the   know   about   all   of   the   latest   baby   gizmos .   ha !   now   if   only   there   were   a   gizmo   to   get   my   toddler   to   stop   taking   my   infant   s   pacifier   in   the   first   place .   then ,   i   would   hardly   need   this .
so   cute ,   but   i   wish   it   was   different ...   this   item   is   adorable ,   i   sure   wish   my   4   month   old   picked   up   the   paci   habit !   the   animal   has   a   pacifier   sewn   into   the   mouth   of   it   it   cannot   be   removed .   my   dog   got   a   hold   of   this   and   chewed   the   circle   aroudn   the   base ,   but   it   cannot   be   replaced   without   buying   a   whole   new   one !   it   sure   would   be   nice   if   the   pacifier   was   interchangable   instead   of   stationary .   i   also   thought   it   would   be   larger ,   but   it   s   a   tiny   little   thing .
so   much   better   than   the   soothie !   this   is   the   only   pacifier   we   could   get   the   baby   to   take   other   than   the   soothie ,   which   covers   the   babies   whole   face .   very   thankful   for   an   alternative .
my   favorite   baby   accessory !   priceless   to   have   a   binki   that   does   not   fall   down   by   their   neck   when   they   spit   it   out ....   it   stays   put   and   they   can   root   around   for   it !   perfect   for   the   car ,   or   for   babies   that   are   swaddled   it   sits   on   their   chest   without   little   arms   to   fling   it   away   .   my   little   one   loves   holding   it ,   and   playing   with   it   s   ears   even   if   she   is   not   in   the   mood   for   the   pacifier .   we   have   the   horse ,   the   giraffe   and   the   elephant .   the   elephant   does   not   stay   put   as   well   as   the   other   two   because   it   not   attached   to   the   most   solid   part   of   the   stuffed   animal .
excellent   well   made   product   i   ordered   a   spare   wubanub   for   my   1   yr .   old   grand   daughter   to   have   when   she   sleeps   over   at   our   house .   this   is   the   only   pacifier   she   uses   and   only   when   she   goes   to   sleep .   she   quickly   finds   it   in   her   crib   and   doesn   t   need   to   have   5   pacifiers   in   there   with   her .   .   it   is   soothing   like   a   normal   pacifier   but   also   soothing   in   a   tactile   way .   it   goes   perfectly   with   her   lovey   which   is   an   angel   dear   blankie .
great   pacifier .   i   did   a   lot   of   research   on   pacifiers   and   these   are   the   only   ones   we   ve   used .   they   are   rubber ,   so   they   do   smell   like   rubber ,   but   that   s   what   i   expected   and   i   don   t   think   the   smell   is   strong .   my   biggest   issue   has   been   keeping   these   away   from   dog ,   who   has   eaten   4   of   them   fortunately   with   zero   vet   bills ...   .   we   got   at   least   a   month   s   use   out   of   each   pacifier   assuming   the   dog   didn   t   eat   it   first   .   i   would   recommend   these .   a   little   more   expensive   than   other   pacifiers ,   but   worth   it   to   know   what   is   going   into   my   baby   s   mouth .   and   fast   shipping ! !
love   it !   my   little   girls   favorite !   i   love   this   product ! !   i   would   love   for   the   pacifier   to   have   a   cap ...   but   other   than   that   is   great ! !   my   little   girl   started   using   it   around   2.5   3   months ,   before   that   she   couldnt   hold   the   horse ,   but   now   she   loves   it   and   grabs   it   without   a   problem ! !   it   makes   it   easier   for   her   to   put   it   back   when   it   falls   too !
love   this   pacifier !   this   is   the   first   pacifier   my   baby   was   able   to   put   in   her   mouth   by   herself .   she   only   uses   pacis   at   her   bedtime ,   and   even   though   i   leave   several   simple   soothie   pacifiers   in   her   crib   along   with   this   wubbanub   kitten   one ,   she   always   reaches   for   the   kitty   paci   first .   she   likes   it   so   much ,   we   got   another   one ,   a   pink   horse ,   for   her   pack   and   play   at   her   grandparents .   i   must   say   though   the   tabby   kitten   feels   like   it   s   of   a   much   better   quality ,   definitely   softer ,   cuddlier   fabric ,   than   the   one   the   horse   pacifier   is   made   of .   oh ,   and   the   baby   with   the   little   kitten   hanging   from   her   mouth   looks   really ,   really ,   really   adorable  
great   product   we   love   the   giraffe .   our   baby   is   3   months   and   she   holds   the   toy   which   keeps   the   pacifier   in   her   mouth .   the   design   is   great   that   the   toy   is   long   and   lays   flat   unlike   some   of   the   other   ones   we   got   the   elephant   for   example   and   doesn   t   fall   out .   i   d   recommend   this   product   and   bought   it   for   my   friends   as   gifts .
teether   this   item   was   for   my   grandson .   he   lives   on   the   other   side   of   the   country .   i   have   no   personal   experience   with   him   and   the   teether .   however ,   i   am   told   that   he   loves   it .

i   m   mostly   a   fan   i   purchased   this   for   my   son   about   a   month   ago .   we   received   a   wabbanub   as   a   gift   a   bear   and   he   liked   it .   i   wanted   another   so   that   we   could   have   one   at   home   and   one   at   daycare .   we   have   not   tried   other   types   of   pacifiers   so   i   can   t   compare   them ,   but   my   son   took   to   the   wabbanub   right   away   we   introduced   it   around   6   weeks   .   he   can   hold   on   to   the   animal   part   when   it   s   in   his   mouth   and   usually   manuver   it   back   in   when   it   falls   out .   he   primarily   uses   it   in   the   car   and   at   daycare .   my   one   complaint   is   about   cleaning   it .   i   have   been   hand   washing   the   pacifier   part   with   dish   soap   and   really   hot   water .   the   pacifier   does   not   detach   from   the   animal   so   i   m   not   sure   how   i   ll   clean   that   part   when   it   gets   really   grimy .   my   niece   has   a   similar   pacifier   but   the   stuffed   animal   and   the   pacifier   come   apart .
best   pacifier   ever   my   newborn   loves   it   the   little   hole   is   the   perfect   size   for   your   finger .   my   baby   loves   to   suck   on   this   pacifier ,   and   it   s   been   a   godsend   in   getting   him   back   to   sleep   after   midnight   breastfeedings   when   he   still   wants   to   suck   but   is   no   longer   drawing   any   milk .   we   brought   one   home   from   the   hospital ,   and   i   m   about   to   buy   a   bunch   more .   don   t   pay   attention   to   people   who   say   they   are   choking   hazards   if   the   pacifier   is   small   enough   that   the   entire   thing   fits   into   your   child   s   mouth ,   it   is   too   small   for   him .   buy   a   bigger   size !
love   wubbanubs !   wubbanubs   are   a   lifesaver !   easy   to   find   and   we   have   never   lost   one   in   the   year   that   we   have   been   using   them .   would   absolutely   recommend   to   any   baby   that   uses   soothies !
lifesaver !   i   have   gone   through   so   many   nooks   with   my   son   throughout   the   last   7   months .   these   are   the   only   ones   that   stay   in   his   mouth   and   he   loves   it .   he   will   actually   whine   for   the   nook   alot !   i   had   problems   with   other   nooks   sitting   funny   on   his   face   or   going   up   his   nose ,   not   with   this   one . i   love   that   it   allows   his   skin   and   face   to   breathe .   it   will   definitely   be   hard   to   break   the   habit .   i   call   it   the   emergency   button .   all   i   have   to   do   is   hand   him   this   mam   nook   when   he   s   crying   and   instantly   he   stops .   i   am   so   thankful   and   highly   recommend   it .   easy   to   wash ,   dishwasher   safe !
best   pacifier !   this   was   the   only   pacifier   my   son   would   take .   and   i   like   it   because   it   is   rubber   and   he   just   chews   all   over   it   now   and   i   don   t   have   to   worry   about   hard   plastic   hurting   his   gums .
so   cute   and   in   perfect   condition   this   was   for   my   pregnant   niece   who   is   doing   a   sheep   theme   for   the   nursery   this   particular   sheep   was   very   small   and   very   cute .
awesome   these   pacifiers   are   great .   my   son   wouldn   t   take   any   other   pacifier   until   i   found   these   on   the   internet .   they   are   reasonably   priced   and   a   really   nice   pacifier .   he   loves   them .
a   lifesaver   my   little   girl   loves   to   hold   on   to   things   when   she   is   upset ,   and   using   her   pacifier .   this   bear   made   it   so   easy   for   her   to   hold   and   grasp ,   plus   i   was   able   to   switch   out   the   pacifier   to   which   ever   one   she   wanted   at   the   time ...   truly   very   cute   and   i   am   buying   another   one   for   my   nephew   d
the   only   paci   my   baby   will   take   when   we   were   in   the   hospital ,   the   nurse   gave   us   a   nuk   pacifier   to   calm   our   baby .   he   never   got   the   hang   of   latching   onto   it   so   it   kept   falling   out   of   his   mouth   or   he   d   just   push   it   out   with   his   tongue .   we   purchased   the   sootheis   just   to   try   them   and   he   loves   them .   it   hasn   t   interfered   with   breastfeeding   at   all   my   one   concern   about   pacifiers   in   general   .   it   s   also   really   fun   to   look   inside   the   little   hole   when   he   s   sucking !
love   it   i   bought   my   son   of   of   these   just   to   keep   his   pacifier   handy .   he   doesn   t   actually   use   his   pacifier ... it   s   more   of   a   teething   toy .   he   loves   the   bink   link ... he   could   care   less   about   the   pacifier ,   he   s   all   about   the   bink   link ... ordering   a   second   one ..
great   for   baby   i   was   glad   to   find   these   on   amazon .   i   only   had   the   1   i   purchased   from   the   hospital   and   they   were   a   little   pricey .   my   baby   doesn   t   take   this   all   the   time   and   i   m   glad   with   him   being   breastfed .   we   did   go   through   a   few   days   of   nipple   confusion   but   then   we   were   able   to   settle   in   to   a   feeding   routine   and   he   is   back   to   being   breastfed   full   time .   he   takes   this   when   he   s   sleepy   after   a   meal   and   won   t   burp .   i   m   glad   they   have   these   and   they   re   supposed   to   be   the   closest   thing   to   the   mother   s   nipple .
looks   great   and   very   functional   this   pacifier   pod   is   very   stylish   and   helpful !   it   goes   with   us   everywhere   and   is   easy   to   access   quickly   when   my   daughter   needs   her   pacifier .   i   like   the   snap   on   strap   to   attach   it   to   her   diaper   bag   and   it   s   just   large   enough   to   carry   two   pacifiers   if   i   need   to   bring   a   back   up   paci .   we   had   a   jj   cole   pacifier   pod   for   almost   a   year   before   it   got   lost   while   running   some   errands .   i   replaced   it   with   this   one   and   am   so   pleased .   i   like   that   this   skip   hop   one   has   a   zipper   closure   instead   of   velcro   and   it   a   tad   wider   inside   so   it   fits   pacifiers   easier   without   bending   them .   i   m   not   sure   what ,   if   ever ,   i   ll   use   the   outer   little   pocket   for ,   but   i   would   recommend   this   pacifier   pod   over   the   jj   cole   ones .
wrong   description ,   last   time   w   seller   the   seller   didn   t   comply   with   description   ,   after   purchasing   the   hawaii   medial   gumdrop   pacifier   newborn ,   natural   scent   pink   ,   i   realized   i   received   the   full   term   pacifier .   hope   others   choose   another   seller   in   if   they   want   to   receive   the   right   product ,   otherwise ,   good   luck .
good ! !   my   baby   had   this   pacifier   since   he   was   born .   they   had   it   at   the   hospital   and   the   baby   only   likes   those .
great ! ! !   i   see   some   people   complaining   about   the   size   having   difficulty   keeping   them   in   their   infants   mouth .   while   the   pacifier   will   fall   out   easier   than   others ,   i   find   that   as   long   as   you   attach   it   to   something   it   stays   in   fine .   i   use   a   paci   plushie   you   can   buy   them   online ,   they   are   like   a   wubanub   but   you   can   use   any   pacifier   in   them ,   including   these   and   it   works   great .   the   stuffed   animal   keeps   it   in   place .   if   you   do   buy   a   paci   plushie   they   used   to   have   a   coupon   code   paci   for   1   2   off   that   still   might   work .   overall   these   are   great   and   is   my   son   s   favorite   pacifier   for   use   in   maximus   the   name   of   his   monkey   paci   plushie .
not   good   for   newborns   my   son   is   now   1   month   old   and   he   was   given   this   pacifier   at   birth   by   the   hospital .   he   still   does   not   like   it   and   does   not   like   the   bottles   made   by   first   year   either .   he   has   a   hard   time   latching   on   and   does   not   seem   to   like   the   toughness   of   the   nipple .   i   am   nursing   him   and   he   seems   to   like   the   softer   nipples .
gumdrop   newborn   pacifier   vanilla   my   baby   isn   t   here   yet   but   i   did   a   lot   of   research   as   i   do   on   everything   before   i   buy   it .   these   seem   to   be   the   best .   when   i   received   them   my   mother   said   they   are   just   like   the   hospital   ones   and   seemed   pleased .   only   reason   i   gave   them   4   stars   as   of   now   is   because   even   though   you   order   the   newborn   ones ,   you   get   the   full   term .   i   m   not   sure   what   the   size   difference   is   but   i   m   hoping   none   or   not   much .   the   company   should   really   fix   this   in   the   description .
great   binky   when   my   son   was   a   newborn   he   was   very   picky   about   pacifiers .   i   must   have   tried   20   different   ones   before   finding   one   that   he   would   take .   now   he   loves   his   nuk   binkies   and   has   also   transitioned   to   he   sippy   cups   with   teh   soft   spout
pacifier   in   theory   this   is   a   great   idea .   an   8   week   old   cannot   hold   his   soothie   so   we   though   this   would   solve   the   car   seat   soothie   loss   problem .   problem   is ,   he   does   not   like   this   as   much   as   the   plain   old   soothie .   cute   idea   though .   it   also   does   not   detatch .   the   pacifier   is   sewn   into   the   puppy   mouth .
couldn   t   mother   without   them   .... well ,   maybe   that   s   a   bit   of   an   extreme   statement ,   but   that   s   how   happy   i   am   with   these   binkys !   i   looked   around   for   weeks   locally   trying   to   find   an   all   natural ,   one   piece   option .   someone   recommended   these   on   a   forum ,   and   we   ve   been   using   them   ever   since .   br   br   some   people   are   put   off   by   their   child   pulling   the   binky   out   with   their   finger   and   the   loop .   it   is   a   minor   issue   for   us .   once   she   got   a   little   older ,   the   loop   works   for   us   she   can   easily   grab   it   and   pop   the   binky   back   into   her   mouth .   br   br   this   is   another   standard   shower   gift   i   include   for   new   moms .   i   hate   to   see   a   baby   using   anything   else !
great !   great   and   bpa   free .   also   nice   that   they   come   in   different   patterns   so   it   s   easy   to   tell   which   one   has   been   out   longer   and   needs   to   go   in   the   dishwasher .
weird   and   heavy   unfortunately ,   i   did   not   like   this   pacifier .   it   was   just   too   big   and   heavy   for   my   newborn   newborn ... and   frankly   just   weird   shaped ,   not   ergonomic   for   my   baby   s   face .   i   recommend   mam   pacifiers   personnally .
these   are   it !   they   came   wrapped   individual   packages ,   like   from   the   hospital .   sanitized   maybe   that   is   why   they   are   more   expensive   then   what   you   can   find   at   the   store ...   but   all   the   stores   were   out   of   them .   these   pacifiers   are   a   staple   at   our   house ,   the   only   ones   he   will   use .   it   is   good   to   replace   every   3   months   too ...
lovely   pacifier ! ! ! !   sasha   pacifiers   as   per   our   son   my   son   loves   it   and   we   are   very   concern   in   to   keep   a   litle   stock   in   home   of   sasha   pacifiers ....... simply   the   best
we   love   it   my   kids   love   it   we   are   collecting   all   models   if   you   are   looking   the   best   try   to   give   it   to   your   kids   happiness   and   healthy   products
great   product   but   not   sure   about   the   vanilla   scent .   these   are   fabulous   pacifiers .   i   would   recommend   them   to   anyone   and   everyone   who   wants   to   get   their   kids   started   on   using   a   pacifier   early .   br   br   the   only   thing   i   m   not   too   sure   about   is   the   vanilla   scent   on   these .   they   had   a   slight   hint   of   vanilla   scent   when   i   first   received   them ,   but   after   about   a   week ,   they   smelled   just   like   our   other   non   scented   gumdrops .   br   br   this   doesn   t   change   how   much   my   baby   likes   them   but   for   some   it   might .
great   pacifier   helps   us   keep   organized !   we   have   several   of   avent   s   regular   pacifiers   at   home ,   which   my   daughter   likes   and   uses   on   a   regular   basis .   when   i   purchased   these ,   the   glow   in   the   dark   feature   was   not   important   to   me ,   as   i   really   didn   t   expect   the   glow   to   last   for   long   c   mon   folks ,   it   s   glow   in   the   dark   the   technology   hasn   t   improved   much   since   1985 ... haha   .   as   other   reviewers   have   noted ,   the   glow   really   does   not   last   too   long   after   the   lights   go   out .   br   br   i   m   sure   most   parents   who   use   pacifiers   for   their   babies   would   agree   with   me   on   this   we   have   pacifiers   floating   all   over   the   house ,   but   it   seems   whenever   you   want   one ,   none   can   be   found .   for   this   reason ,   i   did   like   the   nighttime   pattern   on   the   pacifiers   it   helps   my   husband   and   i   to   remember   that   those   are   the   bedtime   binkies   and   when   we   find   them   around   the   house ,   to   put   them   back   into   her   bed ,   so   we   always   have   a   pacifier   for   bedtime .   yes ,   the   base   of   the   pacifier   is   larger   than   avent   s   regular   design ,   but   i   find   that   the   larger   base   prevents   the   pacifiers   from   falling   through   the   slats   on   my   daughter   s   crib ,   which   happens   to   the   regular   design   frequently .   perfect   if   she   wakes   in   the   night   she   can   find   her   binkie   and   replace   it   herself   which   she   does .   i   m   really   pleased   with   these ,   as   i   have   been   with   all   avent   products   i   have   purchased .
wrong   item   but   still   very   cute !   i   got   a   frog   instead   of   the   bull .   but   the   frog   was   so   cute ,   i   love   it !   my   son   likes   it   too .   he   s   learned   to   put   it   back   in   himself ,   too .
my   twins   love   these !   my   twins   just   turned   two   and   absolutely   love   these   pacifiers !   be   advised   that   around   two ,   you   may   have   to   switch   them   from   the   greenish   newborn   soothie   to   the   pink   or   blue   harder   soothies .   with   two   year   molars   coming   in ,   the   twins   are   starting   to   chew   off   the   tops .   the   newborn   ones   are   also   so   flexible   that   your   baby   will   eventually   fit   the   whole   thing   in   their   mouth .   still ,   i   would   recommend   this   pacifier   to   any   parent .   my   twins   are   obsessed   with   them .   a   tip   for   parents   who   find   their   babies   waking   up   at   night   due   to   lost   binkies .   there   s   a   snack   tray   holder   that   attaches   to   car   seats   runs   around   10   .   it   wouldn   t   work   for   my   britex   car   seats ,   but   it   attaches   easily   to   their   toddler   bed .   i   put   two   extra   binkies   in   there   before   bed   and   during   the   night ,   if   my   twins   wake   up   and   can   t   find   their   binky ,   they   easily   access   them   from   the   snack   tray   holder .   now ,   i   don   t   have   to   wake   up   at   night .
the   do   have   a   funky   taste   these   work   well   in   an   emergency   but   they   do   leave   a   funky   taste   that   may   need   to   be   rinsed   off .
cute   and   effective   these   are   adorable   and   effective .   it   does   a   great   job   of   keeping   the   binky   in   my   son   s   mouth   while   he   sleeps .   he   has   even   managed   to   get   it   in   there   himself   a   time   or   two .   he   also   likes   to   play   with   it .   i   was   so   happy   when   i   found   this   and   even   happier   when   it   worked   so   well .   strangers   have   commented   about   how   cute   and   great   it   is   as   well .
brilliant !   it   is   so   simple ,   but   helpful   in   so   many   ways   1   helps   hold   the   pacifier   in   baby   s   mouth   while   they   are   sleeping   this   is   number   one   benefit   in   my   opinion   2   it   makes   it   easier   for   baby   to   grab   and   put   the   pacifier   in   by   herself   3   if   i   m   holding   my   baby   and   she   s   got   this   in   her   mouth   i   can   easily   hold   on   to   the   lamb   s   back   leg ,   so   if   baby   stops   sucking ,   lamb   does   not   drop   to   the   floor   4   in   the   event   lamb   does   drop   to   floor ,   pacifier   doesn   t   go   bouncing   all   over   the   room   like   regular   pacifier   does   5   doubles   as   a   lovie   attachment   toy   the   price   seems   like   a   lot   for   a   pacifier ,   but   it   is   worth   it   definitely   my   one   complaint ,   as   others   here   have   mentioned ,   i   wish   the   pacifier   could   be   detached   from   the   toy .
cutsie   lives   up   to   it   s   name   cutsie   wubbanub   is   very   cute .   very   colorful   and   useful   as   well .   i   gave   this   wubbanub   as   a   shower   gift .   it   was   well   received .   would   recommend   to   anyone .   i   also   bought   another   wubbanub   for   the   next   baby   in   our   family .
fun   colors !   great   product .   addictive   though !   we   ve   been   using   these   pacifiers   since   our   daughter   was   about   6   weeks   old .   we   never   switched   to   the   super   soothie   which   is   the   2   pack   of   pink   ones   you   see   in   the   drugstores   because   my   daughter   never   took   to   them .   br   br   the   pink   purple   set   is   a   fun   change   i   originally   got   them   to   try   broaden   my   daughter   s   horizons   a   bit   after   my   friend   mentioned   that   her   daughter   was   so   obsessed   with   her   green   soothie   that   even   at   2   years   old   she   is   enamoured   with   anything   that   turquoise   color !   br   br   the   downside   is   that   now   my   daughter   loves   the   purple   one   and   insists   on   it   by   name   papo   one !   ,   so   to   have   another   onhand ,   i   need   to   buy   a   whole   new   package !   you   might   be   thinking   that   if   one   s   child   is   old   enough   to   demand   the   soothie   by   name   and   color   she   is   probably   too   old   to   be   using   this   thing   i   say   i   would   think   the   same   thing .   don   t   do   what   i   did   break   your   little   one   s   addition   in   the   9   12   month   timeframe ,   becuase   if   you   leave   it   until   20   months   where   we   are   now   it   s   probably   become   your   child   s   lovey   by   now   and   they   are   well   addicted .   we   ll   tackle   this   issue   soon ,   but   til   then ,   i   need   another   purple   soothie .
great   for   babes   with   sensitive   skin   the   mam   air   is   a   great   product   for   little   ones   who   tend   to   get   skin   rashes   from   saliva .   the   mouth   piece   allows   the   skin   to   dry   easier   than   the   other   pacifiers .   we   love   it !
pretty   good   this   pacifier   is   great   for   when   your   baby   is   in   the   carseat   or   crib   because   it   offers   the   stuffed   animal   to   hold   onto   which   is   nice .   the   only   down   side   is   the   fact   that   the   pacifier   is   sewn   onto   the   animal   and   cannot   be   removed .   this   makes   it   difficult   to   clean   and   really   the   only   thing   you   can   do   is   rinse   off   the   pacifier   being   careful   not   to   get   the   stuffed   animal   wet .   you   could   put   it   in   the   laundry   but   this   seems   like   too   much   work   everytime   the   paci   needs   to   be   washed .   overall ,   nice   product   although   a   bit   pricey .
love   these   pacifiers   my   baby   loves   these   pacifiers   and   kids   get   a   kick   out   of   watching   him   suck   on   it   because   they   can   see   the   inside   of   his   mouth .
great !   love   these ! !   best   newborn   paci   s   out   there .   i   love   the   shape   and   i   really   love   the   scented   ones .   my   daughter   loved   these   when   she   was   little   and   they   were   the   perfect   size   for   a   newborn .
best   newborn   pacifier   love   these   for   newborns .   they   are   the   perfect   size   and   they   have   a   better   shape   than   the   hospital   provided   soothie   paci   s .
amazing   pacifier !   we   had   our   third   baby   on   12   30   10   and   the   hospital   gave   us   the   gumdrop   pacifier   for   our   son .   this   pacifier   is   amazing   my   son   absolutely   loves   and   will   not   take   any   other   type   of   pacifier   now .   i   wish   we   would   have   known   about   these   with   my   previous   children .   it   does   not   fall   out   of   his   mouth   easily   and   they   are   very   reasonable   priced .   we   came   home   with   an   orange   once   and   since   then   have   ordered   the   blue   ones   from   the   hawii   medical   site .
best   binky   ever ! ! !   my   daughter   loves   the   mam   paci .   we   lost   both   binkys   temporarily   and   had   to   use   a   back   up   but   she   didn   t   like   it .   we   found   the   other   binkys   and   we   are   back   on .   going   to   order   more   of   the   binks   today .
good   pacifier   for   the   baby ,   but   hate   the   shape   buy   a   gumdrop   instead !   i   hate   the   shape   of   this   pacifier .   the   giant   circle   hits   my   baby   s   nose   all   the   time   and   it   does   roll   really   far   away .   she   has   a   hard   time   sucking   on   it   without   it   falling   out ...   blah   blah   blah .   everyone   else   said   the   same   stuff .   only   problem   is   once   they   have   a   soothie   the   other   nipple   shapes   don   t   work   anymore ,   they   won   t   take   them .   the   gumdrop   pacifier   has   the   exact   same   nipple ,   but   better   more   natural   curve   to   their   face ,   and   stays   in   easier .   also   doesn   t   cover   her   nose ,   so   i   feel   better   knowing   it   won   t   keep   her   from   breathing   don   t   think   the   soothies   will ,   but   i   kept   worrying   .
dragon   wubbanub   this   is   awsome !   i   really   like   the   little   dragon ,   baby   likes   it   too ,   it   stays   in   place   for   the   most   part   as   long   as   she   doesn   t   grab   it ,   but   if   she   falls   asleep ,   it   stays   right   there   in   case   she   wakes   up .
awesome   this   is   the   most   awesome   product   ever ! !   i   highly   recommend   it !   my   son   is   tongue   tied   which   means   he   can   t   stick   out   his   tongue .   all   the   other   pacifiers   would   constantly   pop   out   of   his   mouth .   i   would   have   to   hold   it   in   for   him .   with   this ,   the   little   animal   hold   in   his   nu   nu .   this   is   my   3rd   child   and   all   three   have   this   condition   which   is   not   able   to   be   surgically   corrected   until   4   months   of   age .   i   cannot   thank   whoever   came   up   with   this   idea   enough !   thank   you ,   thank   you ,   thank   you !   ps   it   s   next   to   impossible   to   lose !
choking   hazard ! ! !   my   10   month   old   daughter   was   able   to   put   the   whole   pacifier   in   her   mouth   and   then   couldn   t   get   it   back   out .   i   feel   fortunate   that   i   was   there   when   it   happened .
quick   question !   can   anyone   tell   me   if   this   is   the   soft   nipple   like   the   soothie   they   give   in   the   hospital   i   know   soothis   has   2   different   nipple   types   one   is   the   softer   plastic   that   they   give   in   the   hospital   for   newborns   and   another   is   a   harder   more   durable   plastic   for   older   babies   super   soothie   and   my   daughter   will   only   take   the   softer   one   so   id   like   to   know   before   i   buy   it .   help   me   out !
we   love   wubanubs !   my   daughter   loves   these   pacifiers .   she   won   t   use   a   regular   one   and   we   have   several .   they   are   small   enough   for   her   to   cuddle   and   i   don   t   worry   about   the   animal   smothering   her   face .   it   s   safe   for   her   to   sleep   with   and   easy   for   her   to   reach   and   keep   in   her   mouth .   they   wash   easily   and   air   dry   in   less   than   a   day .
try   this   one   first !   hands   down   the   only   pacifier   that   has   worked !   we   have   3   kids !   don   t   try   all   the   other   brands   first !   get   this   one !   i   love   the   contour   compared   to   the   big   hospital   soothies   and   it   s   soo   cute !   should   we   decide   to   add   to   our   family ,   this   one   will   be   the   one   we   do .   these   would   make   great   baby   shower   gift   stuffers   too !
the   only   one   i   ve   try   over   7   different   pacifier   in   the   last   few   months   and   this   is   the   only   one   my   daughter   takes .
a   little   on   the   small   side   although   this   bag   is   really   cute ,   it   is   on   the   small   side .   i   sort   of   regret   buying   it   as   i   was   originally   planning   on   using   a   ziploc   bag   in   the   diaper   bag   to   hold   the   soiled   diapers .   i   like   the   idea   of   being   able   to   throw   the   bag   inside   the   washing   machine   with   the   diapers   so   i   bought   it .   overall ,   the   price   was   right   so   i   will   make   it   work .
the   only   pacifiers   my   daughter   will   take !   we   received   one   of   these   pacifiers   from   the   hospital   and   they   are   the   only   ones   my   baby   will   take !   they   are   a   little   bigger   than   other   pacifiers   we   bought   to   try   but   they   are   well   made   and   hey ,   they   make   for   a   happy   girl !   very   satisfied   with   these   pacis !
my   teething   baby   loves   this !   my   son   loves   this   teether   and   chews   it   from   all   sides .   it   s   easy   to   clean ,   doesn   t   have   any   places   where   water   can   get   trapped ,   and   can   be   run   through   the   dishwater .   i   d   highly   recommend   this   teether .
great   for   carseat   i   bought   this   b   c   baby   kept   spitting   out   paci   and   i   was   constantly   having   to   put   it   back   in   her   mouth .... while   she   is   lying   on   her   back   i   find   it   somewhat   helpful   in   yhe   carseat   its   a   godsend !
baby   loves   these !   my   little   ones   loves   these   pacifiers .   she   s   tried   more   conventional   ones ,   but   these   seem   easier   to   keep   in   more   comfortable   for   her .   i   will   be   buying   many   replacements   of   these !
hate   it ,   pacifier   not   attached   to   the   elephant   correctly   we   have   the   tiger   one   and   we   love   it .   elephant   is   not   attached   to   the   pacifier   at   the   correct   angle ,   so   you   can   t   lay   the   elphant   down   with   the   pacifier   in   baby   s   mouth   on   the   same   angle .   wish   i   got   another   tiger   or   a   longer   animal .   won   t   end   up   using   the   elephant   unfortunatelly ,   wasted   our   money .
just   like   the   soothie   pacifier   we   loved   the   parent   s   choice   soothie   pacifier ,   but   it   was   just   too   big   for   our   baby   s   face .   the   nipple   on   this   pacifier   is   shaped   exactly   the   same ,   but   it   s   just   smaller   and   stays   better   in   our   baby   s   mouth   since   it   contours   to   the   face .   we   love   this   pacifier   and   are   very   happy   we   purchased   it .
a   life   saver ! !   highly   recommend !   we   bought   the   giraffe   wubbanub   for   our   newest   addition ,   our   3rd   baby   girl .   i   cannot   say   enough   great   things   about   the   wubbanub .   she   loves   it !   it   has   become   such   a   comfort   for   her   and   i   can   tell   her   and   her   giraffe   will   be   great   friends .   she   loves   trying   to   grab   and   snuggle   it   and   i   love   that   i   don   t   have   to   keep   putting   a   pacifier   back   in   her   mouth   all   the   time .   thank   you   wubbanub   for   making   a   product   that   is   great   for   every   mom  
not   what   i   expected   thought   that   they   were   going   to   be   like   the   ones   that   they   give   you   at   the   hospital .   these   were   not   as   soft   or   soothie   at   all   like   the   ones   they   have   at   the   hospital .   my   baby   hates   them .
best   binky   ever !   my   daughter   got   the   soothie   binky   in   the   hospital   and   would   only   take   that   kind   thereafter .   the   soothie   blocks   their   nose   and   it   doesn   t   seem   to   stay   in   their   mouth   very   well   because   it   isn   t   contoured   to   their   face .   i   found   this   gumdrop   one   on   amazon   and   she   switched   over   right   away ,   no   problems .   i   think   it   stays   in   better   and   makes   breathing   easier   or   maybe   it   just   makes   me   breathe   easier   not   seeing   her   little   nose   blocked   .   it   also   has   a   hole   for   a   binky   holder ,   which   is   great .   another   good   point   is   that   it   is   all   one   piece   for   safety ,   and   i   don   t   know   how   my   daughter   always   falls   asleep   with   the   binky   wedged   between   her   face   and   the   bed ,   but   with   the   gumdrop   it   s   not   uncomfortable   because   it   doesn   t   have   the   hard   plastic   piece .   the   vanilla   scent   is   nice   but   it   does   fade   after   washing   a   few   times .   it   s   not   that   big   of   a   deal   for   me   because   i   didn   t   buy   it   for   the   scent .  
happy   baby !   i   use   these   interchangeably   with   the   soothie .   only   small   difference   is   that   baby   gets   these   turned   sideways   when   he   sleeps   and   can   t   keep   it   in   his   mouth   that   way   sometimes .   so   we   use   soothie   in   the   crib   they   are   difficult   to   find   a   pacifier   clip   for   anyway   ,   and   gum   drop   around   the   house   and   for   travel .
perfect   for   little   girls !   these   are   just   like   the   soothie   pacifiers   babies   get   in   the   hospital   but   in   pretty   girlie   colors !   i   thought   they   were   way   cuter   than   the   big   green   one   they   give   you !
they   dont   sell   these   pacifiers   anywhere   but   here !   my   son   loves   these   pacifiers ,   he   wont   use   any   other   kind !   im   so   happy   amazon   is   selling   these .   great   price ,   great   value
great   pacifier   with   a   5   day   scent ...   when   our   1st   kid   was   born   we   were   given   the   soothie   vanilla   scented   pacifiers   by   the   hospital   and   our   daughter   wouldn   t   take   any   other   pacifier .   so ,   with   the   twins   on   the   way   i   decided   to   get   more   vanilla   scented   pacifiers ,   did   some   looking   around   and   recognized   that   gumdrops   were   rated   pretty   highly ,   so   i   bought   two   5   packs .   as   described   in   other   reviews ,   the   material   one   piece   and   construction   are   flawless .   however ,   the   scent   only   lasted   for   about   a   week .   this   is   the   reason   for   the   one   star ,   don   t   see   giving   the   product   a   higher   rating   if   it   only   maintains   its   key   attribute   of   scent   for   that   short   of   a   time .   i   recommend   purchasing   the   non   scented   versions   of   the   gumdrop   brand .   we   still   have   a   soothie   from   4   years   ago   that   still   maintains   its   scent .   my   next   pacifier   purchase .   hope   this   helps .
funny   and   of   quality   i   was   afraid   the   quality   would   be   poor   but   it   s   a   perfectly   standard   pacifier .   i   recommend   it   for   fun   and   good   spirits   around   you !
serves   its   purpose ,   but   mine   rusted !   i   have   this   in   black   and   it   works   fine   for   what   it   is .   it   holds   a   pacifier ,   nothing   more .   however ,   mine   corroded   and   rusted   on   the   zipper   parts .   i   don   t   want   rust   anywhere   near   something   my   child   will   put   in   his   mouth   so   i   ll   be   looking   for   an   alternative .   i   never   submerged   it   in   water ,   only   wiped   clean .   i   expected   higher   quality   from   skip   hop .
perfect   binkies   obviously ,   all   babies   are   different   with   what   shape   of   binkie   they   like ,   but   these   are   pretty   universal ,   as   they   are   the   same   shape   as   a   regular   bottle   nipple .   my   daughter   is   9   months   and   still   takes   these   at   bedtime   and   naps .   we   tried   the   3   months   of   these   same   binkies ,   and   they   are   so   thick   and   hard ,   she   was   not   even   interested   on   trying   to   suck   it .   they   are   easy   to   grab ,   so   babies   can   put   them   back   in   their   mouths   by   themselves   once   they   get   the   hand   mouth   coordination .   they   can   be   attached   to   a   binkie   holder   that   has   a   thin   ribbon   as   the   attachment   point   just   pull   it   through   the   hole   and   loop   it   over .   they   are   inexpensive ,   so   you   can   stock   up   on   them   and   not   feel   bad   if   one   gets   lost .
diaper   bag   necessity !   these   are   essential   for   your   diaper   bag .   i   am   not   comfortable   with   sticking   a   binkie   off   the   floor   in   my   baby   s   mouth   straight   in ,   or   wiping   it   off   on   my   pants ,   or   sticking   it   in   my   mouth   first   ,   so   these   are   handy   to   be   able   to   wipe   it   off .   i   use   them   for   binkies ,   bottle   nipples ,   and   toys .   i   do   wish   they   were   a   little   more   economical ,   but   i   wouldn   t   be   without   them !
great   for   baby   i   am   a   big   fan   of   the   wubbanubs .   babies   can   easily   find   their   pacifiers   and   manipulate   them   and   have   a   cute   toy   to   play   with .   only   issue   is   that   the   pacifier   does   not   detach   for   easy   washing .
love   these ! ! !   better   than   soothies !   it   took   a   lot   of   trial   and   error   to   find   a   pacifier   that   my   daughter   would   take   and   she   took   the   soothies   right   away   with   no   problems .   i   just   found   these   and   ordered   them   from   the   company   s   website   since   they   have   the   same   nipple   as   the   soothies .   i   love   them !   my   daughter   takes   them   with   no   problems   and   i   love   that   they   don   t   bump   her   nose   with   every   suck .   and   they   look   so   much   cuter !
very   handy   wipes   for   the   diaper   bag .   love   these !   before   our   daughter   was   done   with   her   pacifier ,   these   were   a   necessity   for   when   we   were   out   and   her   binky   would   drop   on   the   floor .   i   also   use   them   for   toys   and   other   items   that   inevitably   end   up   on   the   floor ,   too .   a   must   for   parents   of   babies !
my   son   loves   his   nuk   genius !   nuk   genius   pacifiers   are   great !   we   had   trouble   finding   a   pacifier   that   our   son   would   take   without   a   problem   and   we   tried   many   different   ones   before   finally   getting   this   one .   our   son   loves   it   and   we   have   been   using   them   since   he   was   a   few   weeks   old   we   are   now   on   size   2   .   the   pacifier   is   softer   than   the   regular   nuk   and   is   shaped   in   a   way   that   leaves   more   space   for   the   tongue .   it   is   also   very   light   and   has   two   slits   on   the   sides   to   allow   more   air   flow .   yes ,   it   s   true   that   the   baby   can   fit   the   whole   thing   in   his   mouth   my   son   did   it   once   when   he   was   about   5   months   old   but   there   is   absolutely   no   way   that   he   would   be   able   to   swallow   it .   plus   the   slits   on   the   sides   would   not   allow   him   to   suffocate   either   the   air   or   saliva   can   still   flow   freely   .   the   baby   can   get   a   little   scared   if   it   got   stuck   in   his   mouth   but   that   s   about   it .   and   by   the   way ,   many   other   pacifiers   out   there   would   fit   in   baby   s   mouth   as   well ,   so   there   is   no   reason   to   deem   this   one   more   dangerous   than   others .   this   pacifier   is   worth   every   penny   and   i   highly   recommend   it .
great   product   but   no   selection   these   really   are   the   best   pacifiers   for   toddlers   and   much   nicer   than   nuk   at   least   according   to   my   little   brother   .   the   mam   pacifiers   are   round   on   both   sides   of   the   nub ,   while   the   nuk   pacifiers   tend   to   have   a   flat   side   to   rest   on   your   tongue ,   however   it   s   really   a   personal   preference ,   so   i   d   try   both   with   your   little   one   to   see   which   one   they   like   more .   like   other   reviewers   though ,   i   m   disappointed   that   it   s   impossible   to   choose   colors   or   at   least   themes !
great   pacifiers ,   can   be   used   for   older   babies   these   pacifiers   are   great .   my   daughter   was   exclusively   breastfed ,   and   was   not   given   a   pacifier   until   she   was   about   2   3   months   old .   while   it   did   take   some   time   for   her   to   get   used   to   the   pacifier ,   this   was   the   only   one   she   would   take .   eventhough   they   say   0   3   months ,   she   is   now   6   months ,   and   continues   to   use   it .   she   has   had   no   nipple   confusion ,   and   eventhough   i   try   to   get   her   to   take   other   pacifiers ,   she   will   only   suck   on   these .   it   is   great   because   they   really   help   her   settle   down   for   her   naps ,   and   doesn   t   need   them   at   any   other   time   during   the   day .
great   pacifier ,   great   customer   service   through   the   manufacturer   my   son   loves   this   paci .   it   is   the   only   kind   he   will   use .   we   tried   the   soothie   brand   but   he   had   a   hard   time   keeping   it   in   his   mouth .   it   was   like   it   was   at   the   wrong   angle   in   his   mouth   because   of   the   circular   shape   and   it   resting   against   his   nose .   i   discovered   these   and   thought   i   d   give   them   a   try .   they   worked   like   a   charm .   he   has   never   had   an   issue   keeping   these   in   his   mouth   because   there   is   nothing   pushing   against   his   nose   when   he   sucks ,   and   because   of   the   contoured   shape .   now   i   will   say   that   it   would   be   nice   if   the   entire   pacifier   was   solid   silicone   like   the   soothise   pacifier   is .   i   had   2   of   the   gum   drop   pacifiers   begin   to   peel   away   along   the   inside   where   the   internal   hard   plastic   form   is .   i   contacted   the   seller   who   directed   me   to   the   manufacturer .   they   were   more   than   appologetic   and   sent   replacements   and   also   a   return   envelope   for   the   damaged   pacifiers .   they   seemed   genuinely   shocked   that   this   had   happened   to   2   of   my   pacifiers .   despite   this   issue   with   a   few   of   the   gumdrop   pacifiers ,   i   still   think   they   are   an   excellent   product .   when   you   manufacture   thousands ,   if   not   millions ,   of   pacifiers   there   is   bound   to   be   a   few   defective   ones   that   slip   past   quality   control .   i   do   not   think   that   should   negate   the   fact   that   this   is   an   awesome   product .
our   baby   s   favorite   pacifier   we   tried   4   or   5   different   pacifiers   something   i   recommend   ,   and   this   shape   was   the   one   our   baby   preferred .   it   s   a   bit   pricier   than   other   pacifiers ,   and   our   baby   seems   to   like   the   nuk   classic   as   well ,   so   that   is   another   option .   it   s   a   bit   tricky   to   clean   and   dry ,   as   it   gets   water   into   the   tip .
hospital   binky   my   baby   used   this   kind   since   the   hospital   sent   it   home   with   us .   they   began   cracking   at   7mo .   so   i   got   more .   he   loves   them ! !
great   for   teething   baby !   when   i   first   got   this   for   my   daughter   i   thought   it   could   be   used   as   a   regular   pacifier   but   it   is   really   heavy .   i   realized   the   nipple   is   much   more   tough   and   it   s   perfect   for   her   to   chew   on   along   with   the   textured   sides   which   are   actually   accessible   .   i   guess   you   could   use   it   as   a   pacifier   but   i   would   imagine   that   a   baby   s   jaw   would   get   tired   from   trying   to   hold   it .   i   only   use   it   as   a   teether .   the   main   reason   i   like   this   because   it   s   the   same   shape   as   the   pacifier   we   got   from   the   hospital   and   the   only   one   she   likes .   i   ve   probably   bought   at   least   10   teethers   and   this   only   one   she   likes !
i   chose   boy   colors   and   got   girl   colors !   my   son   loves   these   pacifiers .   i   chose   the   pacifiers   that   are   blue   and   white   with   racecars   on   them .   however ,   i   opened   the   box ,   and   to   my   dismay ,   received   hot   pink   pacifiers   with   peacocks   on   them .   my   husband   will   not   be   pleased   when   he   sees   our   son   with   hot   pink ,   girly   pacifiers .
love   it   this   thing   is   a   lifesaver .   my   son   can   find   his   pacifier   anytime   he   wants   cause   when   i   put   the   plush   toy   on   his   chest ,   the   pacifier   is   always   within   his   reach .   we   can   all   sleep   sound .
awesome !   these   are   the   same   pacifiers   my   son   was   given   at   the   hospital   and   i   love   them .   they   are   better   than   the   ones   they   sell   at   babies   r   us   or   the   baby   stores   because   these   have   the   shape   of   the   mouth   and   it   doesn   t   look   like   its   taking   over   his   mouth   compared   to   the   one   that   is   a   full   cirlce   .   he   won   t   take   any   other   pacifier .   they   are   great !
i   tried ...   i   m   desperately   trying   to   get   my   newborn   to   take   a   pacifier   and   he   just   won   t .   we   have   4   different   brands   and   he   spits   them   all   out .   a   friend   recommended   the   gumdrop   so   we   gave   them   a   try .   i   love   the   shape   and   size ,   but   our   lil   buddy   won   t   take   it .   i   don   t   think   it   s   the   product ,   i   think   it   s   our   non   sucking   baby  
only   binky   my   kiddo   will   use !   this   is   the   only   binky   my   kiddo   will   use .   we   are   stationed   in   japan ,   and   they   are   not   always   available   at   the   px ,   so   i   order   a   ton .   i   think   it   got   here   in   5   days ,   which   is   great   considering   im   all   the   way   across   the   world !   p
good   product ,   but   maybe   too   much   for   small   babies   my   baby   loved   her   soothie   pacifiers   but   since   she   starting   teething   has   shown   little   interest   in   doing   anything   but   chewing   on   her   fist !   she   liked   the   pacifier   part   just   fine ,   as   it   s   the   same   as   the   regular   soothies .   but   the   teether   is   very   wide ,   thick   and   heavy ,   and   she   can   barely   fit   even   a   corner   of   it   in   her   mouth .   now   she   s   a   preemie ,   so   for   bigger   babies   this   may   not   be   a   problem .   i   like   that   is   s   only   one   solid   piece   so   less   chance   of   her   gnawing   it   to   bits .   i   m   going   to   keep   it   around   until   she   s   better   able   to   keep   a   grip   on   it .
baby   loves   these   pacifiers   i   thought   these   were   relatively   expensive   for   a   pacifier   but   i   heard   good   things   from   other   moms   so   i   decided   to   buy   one .   my   son   loves   these !   they   are   softer   and   almost   flatter   then   the   regular   nuks .   they   do   get   water   trapped   in   it   if   you   boil   it   but   it   just   takes   a   squeeze   to   get   out .   i   reccomend
love   it ! ! !   i   was   glad   it   came   with   the   soothie   pacifier   since   it   s   the   only   kind   my   4   month   old   son   likes   to   use .   it   s   also   very   cute   to   see   him   hug   his   lion   as   he   falls   asleep .   i   highly   recommend   this   product .
great   product   really   nice   little   bear .   my   8   month   old   loves   it .   super   soft   and   definitely   well   made .   the   strap   for   the   binky   is   pretty   tight   and   i   haven   t   actually   switched   the   binky   out   yet   but   it   s   just   a   great   little   product   my   little   one   actually   seems   to   like   the   one   it   came   with   which   surprised   me   .   even   nicer   than   the   picture   looks .
adorable !   purchased   for   my   granddaughter   and   she   loved   it .   easy   to   find .   also   bought   her   the   caterpillar   and   little   doll .   hospital   recommended .   they   last   a   long   time   as   well .
only   one   our   son   would   take   the   hospital   gave   us   one   of   these   when   my   son   started   crying   just   as   we   were   taking   him   home   the   first   day .   we   then   tried   some   orthodontic   pacifiers   and   the   gumdrop .   but   with   those ,   he   did   not   like   the   conforming   face   shield   so   much   that   within   the   first   week   he   would   shield   his   face   using   his   hands   .   so   the   round   soothie   shield   even   if   it   looks   ugly   was   the   only   thing   he   would   take .   the   only   issue   i   have   is   the   fact   that   our   pacifier   tethers   don   t   work   with   it .   but   i   ll   chalk   that   up   as   a   learning   expense .
perfect   for   breastfed   babies   i   breastfed   my   daughter   exclusively   for   the   first   6   months .   we   introduced   this   pacifier   at   2   months   and   she   loved   it   right   away .   it   was   the   only   style   that   she   would   use .   she   is   now   7   months   and   no   longer   takes   a   pacifier ,   but   she   still   likes   to   chew   on   these .   so   they   make   great   teethers   as   well !
only   one   that   works   for   us   this   is   the   only   pacifier   my   3   month   old   can   keep   in   her   mouth   for   longer   than   a   few   seconds .   it   s   curved   shape   fits   around   her   mouth   perfectly ,   and   it   s   a   lot   lighter   than   other   pacifiers .   good   product .
so   far   so   good   we   ve   been   using   this   for   about   a   week .   so   far   it   s   been   wonderful .   i   love   it .   the   screen   is   clear ,   you   can   zoom   in   or   out .   you   can   pan   up ,   down ,   left ,   right .   it   s   perfect .   i   heard   people   complain   about   interference ,   but   we   haven   t   had   any   thus   far .
sort   of   a   wooden   high   chair   this   chair   is   easy   to   set   up ,   use   and   keep   clean ,   but   we   are   still   disappointed   with   it .   we   thought   that   we   were   purchasing   a   solid   wood   chair   the   price   seems   high   enough   that   it   should   be   ,   but   this   one   is   constructed   out   of   well   made   press   board   and   covered   in   some   sort   of   lacquer   is   it   safe   to   chew   on   !   .   the   tray   is   also   not   solid   wood .   the   real   downer   is   that   the   lacquer   started   peeling   off   of   the   tray   after   a   few   uses .   update   we   ve   been   using   this   chair   for   8   months   now .   we   ve   replaced   our   original   tray   and   ordered   the   plastic   cover   that   snaps   on   to   it .   the   plastic   cover   is   a   must   if   you   are   using   the   tray .   it   goes   on   and   off   easily   and   can   even   go   in   the   dishwasher .
pros   and   cons   for   daycare   and   home   use   i   purchased   this   product   for   my   infant   and   have   used   it   now   for   two   and   a   half   years ,   two   of   my   own   babies ,   and   a   daycare   run   from   our   house .   br   br   i   love   the   fact   that   the   receiver   will   reach   from   the   nursery   window   to   the   mailbox ,   the   garden ,   and   even   grandma   s   house   our   nearest   neighbor   .   br   br   i   like   the   multiple   channels .   i   have   multiple   monitors   and   while   you   can   put   them   all   on   the   same   channel   and   monitor   multiple   rooms   at   once ,   i   prefer   to   have   each   room   on   a   different   channel   so   i   can   flip   through   and   easily   monitor   the   children   in   each   room   separately .   this   helps   cut   down   on   background   noise   as   well .   br   br   i   find   that   the   background   noise   is   easily   managed   by   turning   down   the   monitor .   when   the   volume   is   turned   all   the   way   up   i   can   hear   the   clock   ticking   in   my   sons   room   i   can   t   even   hear   the   clock   when   i   am   in   the   room   .   turned   about   halfway   down   i   can   easily   hear   when   they   start   to   fuss   without   hearing   every   hiccup   and   sigh   amplified   and   without   static   .   br   br   from   reading   other   reviews   the   apparent   reason   people   can   t   get   batteries   to   work   is   that   you   have   to   unplug   the   ac   adapter !   i   m   also   not   sure   why   you   would   use   batteries   all   night   when   i   m   sure   everyone   has   an   outlet   within   close   proximity   of   their   bed .... i   keep   my   receiver   plugged   into   the   wall   in   a   central   location   and   only   use   the   batteries   when   i   am   outside   and   don   t   have   access   to   an   outlet .   i   have   probably   changed   the   batteries   once   or   maybe   twice   in   over   two   years .   br   br   my   only   complaint   is   that   transmitters   are   not   sold   separately   or   two   transmitters   with   one   receiver   instead   of   the   other   way   around .   i   only   need   one   receiver   that   i   keep   with   me   but   i   would   like   to   have   four   or   five   transmitters   two   upstairs   bedrooms ,   one   nursery ,   one   or   two   for   basement   playrooms   and   den   .   br   br   if   multiple   rooms   could   operate   on   one   channel   without   so   much   interference   and   i   could   buy   additional   transmitters   without   receivers   i   would   certainly   give   this   product   five   stars .
decent   i   bought   this   in   conjunction   with   the   larger ,   non   collapsing   plh   drying   rack .   i   got   this   one   with   the   intent   of   holding   my   pumping   equipment   and   the   other   to   hold   bottles .   this   rack   is   okay ,   but   i   have   to   admit   that   i   like   the   other   much   better .   i   don   t   like   the   lack   of   drip   tray   on   this ,   which   requires   me   to   keep   a   towel   under   it .   the   biggest   problem   i   have   with   it   is   that   several   of   the   rods   that   hold   the   bottles   up   are   too   short   to   hold   8oz   bottles   which   is   what   i   pump   into   .   if   you   are   looking   to   dry   a   few   4oz   bottles   or   just   some   basic   pumping   stuff ,   it   d   be   fine ,   but   if   you   are   looking   something   to   do   it   all ,   this   will   fall   short .
no   product   support   i   purchased   this   product   yesterday   from   a   retail   store   in   a   factory   sealed   box .   i   was   trying   to   follow   the   instructions   and   discovered   that   my   carrier   was   missing   the   lumbar   support .   i   called   infantino   product   support   to   find   out   if   i   was   just   not   seeing   something   correctly   and   i   was   directed   to   return   to   the   store   not   on   my   list   to   do   with   a   4   week   old   or   go   to   their   website   for   full   instructions .   the   instructions   on   the   website   were   the   same   as   what   was   included   in   the   box .   i   called   back   to   see   if   they   could   mail   me   the   pice   or   a   replacement   and   i   was   told   that   they   could   only   redirect   me   to   the   store .   i   will   never   buy   another   infantino   product   again .   they   have   no   product   support .
eh ...   these   are   just   the   same   as   any   other   wash   cloth   except   they   are   smaller   and   softer .   i   like   the   bigger   baby   washcloths .   there   just   isn   t   anything   special   about   these .   except   for   the   sponge .   i   love   that .   i   could   have   saved   myself   some   money   just   buying   the   sponge ,   but   i   didn   t   realize .
very   cool   great   teether   and   toy .   i   don   t   agree   with   the   doggie   toy   comments ,   it   s   better   quality   than   that .   so   what   it   squeaks ,   kids   love   that .
love   this   scale !   this   is   a   great   scale   we   used   it   for   our   twins   and   were   thankful   we   got   it   as   a   gift !
fun   and   good   quality   this   item   arrived   within   the   given   timeframe   with   a   little   excitment   that   i   didn   uacute   vt   anticipate .   although   it   wasn   t   anything   valuable   but   definitely   added   value   and   left   a   good   impression .   br   br   i   would   recommend   to   friends .
love   the   city   mini   bassinet   we   loved   using   the   city   mini   bassinet   for   our   baby   and   got   so   much   use   out   of   it .   we   started   using   it   as   soon   as   we   got   home   from   the   hospital ,   and   took   her   for   many   walks   in   it .   it   is   padded   with   foam   and   our   baby   slept   very   comfortably   in   there   during   walks .   it   easily   disconnects   from   the   stroller   base ,   and   is   not   too   heavy .   i   used   bassinet   sheets   to   line   it ,   they   fit   perfectly   and   made   it   easy   to   clean .   the   mosquito   net   that   it   comes   with   was   also   excellent   for   blocking   out   sun   and   anything   from   blowing   into   the   bassinet .   we   used   it   until   she   was   about   3   1   2   months   old ... because   she   was   so   tall   and   grew   out   of   it .   i   would   have   kept   using   it   otherwise .   the   only   issues   i   had   with   the   city   mini   bassinet   are   1 .   the   price   however ,   we   were   lucky   enough   to   find   a   gently   used   one   on   craigslist   that   was   in   perfect   condition ,   for   half   the   price .... i   definitely   recommend   doing   this .   and   2 .   the   hood   is   sometimes   a   little   tricky   to   put   down   because   you   have   to   press   both   buttons   down   simultaneously ... while   also   pushing   down   the   canopy ,   which   is   hard   to   do .... i   figured   out   a   system   that   worked ,   so   it   wasn   t   a   big   deal .
great   pack   n   play !   this   pack   n   play   was   everything   i   thought   it   would   be   when   i   ordered   it .   it   is   rather   large   as   to   be   expected   with   any   pack   n   play   .   but   the   changing   table   is   a   perfect   height   so   you   don   t   have   to   bend   and   strain   your   back !   it   s   super   cute   and   stylish   we   went   with   a   green   and   brown   theme   to   try   and   tie   in   baby   s   stuff   with   our   established   earth   tone   living   room   decor   fisher   price   has   a   zen   collection   swing   that   matches   pretty   good   .   the   pack   n   play   folds   up   nice   and   compact   so   you   can   just   throw   it   in   the   trunk   if   you   re   traveling .   the   bassinett   part   and   changer   do   not   fold   up ,   but   it   s   still   pretty   convenient .   i   chose   to   purchase   from   amazon   instead   of   target   because   of   the   super   saver   free   shipping .   same   price   at   both   locations  
safe   new   born   blanket   loved   this   when   my   baby   wasn   t   too   mobile .   he   was   6   lbs   when   we   first   used   this ,   we   had   to   wrap   it   more   and   had   troubles   till   he   was   a   little   bigger .   when   he   was   the   perfect   size   he   was   too   strong   for   this   swaddle .   i   still   loved   it   and   would   recommend   using   as   soon   as   possible .   my   baby   loved   being   swaddled ,   even   now   an   then   at   9   months   it   helps   him   sleep .
great   dresser   but   is   being   discontinued   this   is   a   great   dresser   but   it   is   being   discontinued   along   with   the   other   items   in   the   set .   i   had   a   hard   time   finding   it   avalible   but   was   so   glad   to   find   it   here   on   amazon   because   i   saved   100   with   free   shipping   when   i   purchased   the   crib   along   with   it .
great   product   this   mattress   is   a   perfect   fit   for   my   20   year   old   cradle .   it   was   shipped   neatly   wrapped   in   plastic ,   so   i   knew   it   was   clean .   it   is   not   too   soft   and   not   too   hard .   i   would   have   to   say   it   s   the   perfect   cradle   mattress !
i   like   it ,   it   worked   for   us ...   i   got   this   a   year   ago ,   and   it   has   worked   very   well   since .   i   carry   it   every   where   in   the   baby   s   diaper   bag .   i   actually   only   use   it   on   emergency   cases ...   but   so   far ,   it   was   a   good   buy !   it   was   worth   what   we   pay .
got   these   for   a   friend   i   bought   these   for   a   friend   and   she   told   me   that   her   son   preferred   these   over   all   of   the   others   she   received   for   her   baby   shower .
we   named   her   ellie   the   elephant   my   granddaughter   loves   her   ellie   .   she   also   has   a   lamb   lucy   and   her   green   frog   fred   .   very   comforting   for   her   and   us !
total   lifesaver   and   super   cute ! ! !   our   little   guy ,   now   7   months ,   loves   his   wubbies .   he   has   3   the   giraffe ,   the   monkey ,   and   the   puppy ,   but   this   is   his   favorite .   we   put   them   in   his   crib   at   night   and   if   he   wakes   up   crying ,   he   finds   one ,   puts   it   in   his   mouth ,   and   goes   back   to   sleep   about   90   of   the   time   completely   on   his   own .   he   s   been   able   to   put   them   in   his   own   mouth   for   a   couple   months   now .   in   the   morning ,   he   wakes   up   and   collects   all   three   together   and   plays   with   them   for   about   an   hour   which   lets   us   sleep   in ,   another   huge   plus   .   if   he   s   tired   or   fussy ,   his   wubs   soothe   him   right   away .   because   of   the   little   animal   attached ,   he   doesn   t   lose   or   drop   it   very   easily   at   all ,   and   it   gives   him   something   to   hold   on   to   which   is   very   comforting   for   him .   he   also   loves   it   for   teething   now .   i   am   very   confident   that   learning   to   pick   these   up   on   his   own   and   put   them   in   his   mouth   has   really   increased   his   manual   dexterity .   they   wash   really   easily   in   the   washing   machine   and   you   don   t   even   have   to   stick   them   in   the   dryer   because   they   dry   so   fast .   the   only   downside   is   if   you   have   pets   the   hair   may   stick   to   the   pacifier   part ,   but   we   don   t   have   this   problem .   did   i   mention   we   get   tons   of   compliments   on   how   cute   they   are   you   really   can   t   go   wrong   with   these   little   guys ! ! !   they   are   probably   my   favorite   of   all   our   baby   items   .
my   son   s   favorite   binkie !   i   bought   this   for   my   son ,   now   15   months ,   when   he   was   about   7   months   old .   he   learned   to   put   in   his   pacifier   by   himself .   now   that   he   s   older ,   he   holds   it   by   the   giraffe   and   pops   it   in   his   mouth .   what   s   nice   is   that   when   he   s   finally   weaned   from   the   pacifier ,   he   can   still   play   with   the   giraffe .   he   owns   this   one   and   a   monkey   and   he   loves   loves   loves   them   both ! !   he   can   recognize   it   from   across   the   room   and   run   towards   it .   people   find   it   hilarious   when   they   see   h

happy   baby ,   happy   mommy ,   happy   grandma   i   bought   these   for   my   daughter ,   prior   to   my   granddaughter   s   arrival .   my   daughter   said   she   d   already   purchased   a   nuk   pacifier   and   they   were   supposed   to   be   good .   after   my   granddaughter   arrived ,   she   refused   to   take   the   nuk .   my   daughter   forgot   she   had   these   but   daddy   reminded   her .   she   tried   them   and   the   baby   loves   it .   it   s   the   only   one   she   takes .   they   also   come   individually   wrapped   and   are   already   sterilized .   a   plus .   also ,   as   others   have   said ,   it   s   nice   because   you   can   put   your   finger   into   the   pacifier   to   help   the   baby   get   started   or   just   to   feel   their   little   mouth .   you   can   also   see   through   the   pacifier   too   and   watch   them .   definitely   recommend   them .   my   daughter   doesn   t   think   grandma   s   research   of   everything   is   so   crazy   now .
perfect   for   baby   i   bought   this   right   after   i   started   baby   sitting   my   granddaughter   at   six   weeks   old .   she   s   8   months   old   now ,   and   this   has   turned   out   to   be   the   best   thing   i   ve   gotten   her .   as   it   turns   out   it   s   a   real   wrist   saver .   when   i   m   holding   and   feeding   her   i   prop   her   wubbanub   we   call   it   wubby   under   the   bottle   and   i   just   barely   balance   with   my   hand .   she   will   hold   on   to   a   leg   or   tail   and   when   i   take   the   bottle   away   she   still   has   wubby   while   she   s   snoozing   plus   a   toy   pacifer   when   she   s   awake .   well   worth   the   money .
a   must   have   for   any   parent   or   grandparent !   i   keep   giving   this   to   my   friends   as   a   shower   gift .   thet   all   rave   about   it   because   it   hooks   to   anything .   the   dad   s   like   it   to   because   they   can   carry   a   clean   pacifier   without   having   to   have   a   big   bag   with   it   in   it .   fits   a   wide   variety   of   pacifiers   and   keeps   a   clean   pacifier   handy   without   having   to   dig   for   it   when   it   s   needed .
loved   these   i   can   t   say   enough   about   these ... we   had   about   6   for   the   whole   time   he   was   using   them .. no   more   lost   pacifiers   and   he   could   easily   put   it   back   in   himself   at   a   very   young   age .   also   by   a   few   weeks   old   he   would   be   petting   them   as   he   went   to   sleep .   i   had   to   return   to   work   at   5   weeks   and   by   3mos   he   was   sleeping   12   hours   through   the   night   with   the   help   of   this   pacifier .   after   the   first   couple   of   weeks   searching   for   the   pacifier   in   the   dark   he   was   in   my   bed   in   a   sleeper   thingamajig   for   week   5   10   i   found   these ! !   i   worried   he   would   have   too   much   of   an   attachment   to   the   stuffed   animal   but   he   was   off   this   and   the   bottle   by   18   months .   also ,   the   pacifier   is   the   one   they   use   in   the   hospital   so   you   don   t   have   to   worry   about   switching .   i   washed   it   in   the   dishwasher   and   air   dried   and   also   just   washed   the   pacifier   part   often .   we   did   lose   a   few   at   others   houses   and   had   to   replace   1   or   2   when   they   were   worn   but   for   the   extra   sleep   those   first   couple   of   months ,   it   was   well   worth   the   .
no   other   pacifier   would   work   my   son   wouldn   t   accept   any   other   pacifier   and   i   couldn   t   find   them   in   another   other   store .   i   had   to   stock   up ! !   love   these ! !
always   opening ,   loses   pacifier   the   cases   i   recieved   continually   came   open   causing   the   pacifiers   to   fall   out   which   was   more   inconvenient   than   having   to   dig   them   out   of   my   diaper   bag .   just   not   as   durable   as   i   had   expected .
my   baby   s   favorite   pacifier   and   it   glows   in   the   dark   my   baby   definitely   prefers   the   avent   pacifiers .   we   like   these   because   they   are   so   much   easier   to   find   at   night   in   a   dark   room .   i   just   wish   the   glow   lasted   a   bit   longer .
love   it !   this   is   an   answer   to   my   prayers .   i   wish   the   stuffed   animal   was   a   little   heavier   to   stay   in   place   on   my   babies   chest .   the   soothie   paci   is   sewn   to   the   animal   so   once   it   wears   out   you   ll   need   to   buy   another   one .   i   thought   the   stuffed   animal   clipped   onto   the   paci .   but   i   still   love   it !
it   s   ok   i   didn   t   know   the   pacifier   was   attached   to   the   giraffe .   it   looked   much   bigger   and   i   thought   the   pacifier   came   off .   you   have   to   wash   the   toy   with   the   pacifier   attached   and   then   wash   the   pacifier .   it   s   cute ,   but   not   worth   the   14.95 .
the   best   i   love   this   wubbanub .   i   would   love   to   have   all   the   different   ones .   it   s   the   best   thing   for   a   baby .   mom   s   will   love   you   for   this   gift .   always   good   to   have   several   around .   asin   b0028idxds   wubbanub   infant   plush   toy   pacifier   monkey  
good   pacifiers   they   don   t   get   spit   water   trapped   inside   like   the   traditional   pacifier .   so   they   don   t   get   moldy   and   they   last   longer .   you   can   put   them   in   the   mouth   at   any   angle   great   for   when   it   s   dark .
great   binkies !   i   love   these   binkies .   we   were   given   one   for   our   daughter   in   the   hospital ,   and   its   the   only   binkie   she   ll   use .   we   ve   tried   other   ones   but   she   spits   them   out .   she   loves   these ,   so   we   had   to   stock   up !
perfect   for   newborn   a   friend   bought   these   for   me   for   my   newborn   baby   girl   and   she   loves   them .   they   are   very   light   weight ,   which   is   a   must   for   newborns .   these   were   my   daughter   s   first   pacifiers   and   i   tried   another   brand   just   recently   and   even   though   they   were   marked   for   0   6   months ,   they   were   too   heavy   for   her   to   hold   in   her   mouth   she   s   4   weeks   old   ,   so   back   to   mam !
the   best !   this   was   the   pacifier   that   was   given   to   our   daughter ,   while   in   the   hospital .   we   tried   pther   pacifiers ,   but   she   just   did   not   like   them ,   so   we   just   had   to   buy   some .   we   love   the   cut   out   for   her   little   nose   and   how   durable   they   are !   love   this   product !
love   this ! ! ! ! ! !   i   love   wabbanub !   soothie   pacifiers   are ,   in   my   opinion ,   the   best .   the   animal   holds   the   pacifier   in   just   the   right   place .   it   also   keeps   it   from   falling   on   the   ground   all   of   the   time ,   or   rolling   away   and   getting   lost .   my   little   boy   has   had   his   for   almost   a   year   now .   he   sucks   it   while   crawling   around   and   rubs   the   ears   with   his   fingers   when   he   s   getting   sleepy .   now   i   give   one   to   everyone   i   know   of   who   is   having   a   baby .   this   product   is   so   great ,   i   m   sort   of   surprised   they   aren   t   more   widely   available !
looks   weird ,   but   baby   loves   it !   i   started   my   baby   out   with   a   nuk   and   she   has   never   really   cared   for   it .   she   spits   it   out   like   it   it   s   a   strange ,   yukky   foreign   object !   her   older   brother ,   on   the   other   hand ,   used   to   like   the   nuk   just   fine   which   is   why   i   started   her   out   with   it .   after   reading   a   review   elsewhere   from   a   delivery   nurse   that   never   saw   a   baby   that   didn   t   like   the   soothie ,   i   decided   to   give   it   a   try .   my   baby   loves   it   and   i   m   really   glad   i   gave   it   a   try .
bettyboop   it   is   so   cutie , just   the   right   size   for   my   new   grandbaby   to   hold   on   to .
the   best   pacifier   for   nursing   babies   we   were   given   this   pacifier   by   a   friend   who   received   a   box   of   them   when   her   child   was   in   the   nicu .   it   is   the   best   for   nursing   babies ! !   i   wanted   my   son   to   be   able   to   self   soothe   without   using   his   thumb   or   fingers ,   but   was   determined   to   nurse   without   supplementing .   after   a   week   of   using   the   gumdrop   and   seeing   no   changes   in   my   son   s   nursing ,   we   ordered   our   own   box   of   10 .   we   were   soooo   pleased   they   are   hospital   grade   and   come   individually   wrapped   and   sterilized .   i   am   a   germaphobe   and   love   that   i   could   just   pop   open   the   package   and   have   a   fresh ,   clean   pacifier .   they   are   also   so   light   that   they   never   disturbed   him   at   night ,   so   there   was   no   getting   up   to   give   him   his   pacifier   he   just   slept   on .   my   son   nursed   like   a   champ   for   a   year   and   we   switched   to   a   nuk   when   he   outgrew   the   gumdrop .   the   day   he   turned   2 ,   he   handed   me   his   paci   and   said   no   paci ,   mommy ... and   that   was   it .   we   will   definitely   use   the   gumdrop   again   for   the   next   baby ,   and   gumdrops   make   great   baby   gifts !
best   purchase   this   was   one   of   the   best   purchases   i   have   made   as   a   new   mom .   the   binkibear   is   the   perfect   size   for   my   little   man   to   hold .   the   bear   is   perfect   way   for   him   to   find   the   binki   on   his   own   without   me   having   to   get   up   and   give   it   to   him   at   night   or   during   the   day .   when   we   are   out   and   about   so   many   people   are   fascinated   by   the   bear   asking   where   i   have   gotten   it   and   said   they   are   going   to   recommend   it   to   other   moms   they   know .   the   only   downsize   was   the   size   of   the   binki ,   little   man   loves   the   oval   binki   and   the   one   that   came   with   the   bear   has   a   palet   shape   and   is   smaller   than   what   he   was   used   to .   fortunately   i   had   a   binki   with   a   handle   of   the   shape   he   likes .
wonderful   my   son   loves   his   pacifier   and   this   has   been   a   huge   help   at   night   when   he   was   5   weeks   old .   now   he   is   almost   3   months   old   and   he   loves   to   hold   on   to   the   legs .   i   would   highly   recommend   these !
perfect   baby   buddy   i   love   this ,   even   though   my   baby   quit   using   pacifiers ,   he   still   hugs   his   wubbanub   to   sleep .   i   can   easily   hand   wash   hang   dry   the   kitten .   it   has   proven   to   be   very   durable .   the   pacifier   is   well   stitched   to   the   stuffy .   i   am   very   pleased   with   this   product .
couldn   t   live   without   it !   our   2   month   old   loves   her   wubbanubs !   i   would   highly   recommend   for   any   baby   who   uses   a   soothie   pacifier .   easy   to   wash   right   in   the   washing   machine !
need   to   be   sold   in   stores ! !   my   son   absolutely   loves   these   pacifiers !   he   was   given   one   in   the   hospital   and   wont   take   any   other   pacifier !   i   wish   they   were   sold   in   stores   like   walmart   so   i   could   buy   them   instead   of   ordering   them   online   but   definitely   worth   the   money .
yes ,   they   exist !   this   is   the   same   kind   the   nicu   used   for   my   preemie .   he   hated   all   the   other   ones ,   and   it   s   kinda   cool   you   can   see   his   gums   through   the   hole .   my   newborn   isn   t   all   about   the   pacifier ,   but   when   he   needs   it ,   he   ll   hang   onto   it .   so   glad   i   don   t   have   to   go   looking   all   around   town   to   find   these .
colors   may   vary   my   son   never   used   these ... since   he   is   a   boy   and   the   ones   i   received   were   pink ... so   i   can   t   attest   to   whether   he   liked   them   or   not .   maybe   it   s   just   me ,   but   colors   may   vary   just   doesn   t   fly   with   baby   stuff   unless   all   the   colors   are   neutral .
nice   but   risky   and   definitely   not   on   fiberglass   inserts   husband   bought   this   and   the   smaller   one   for   my   mother   in   law   who   has   moved   in   with   us .   we   have   tub   and   shower   that   are   pre   fab   fiberglass   inserts .   they   will   not   hold   suction   longer   than   a   day .   they   are   unreliable   for   my   mother   in   law   even   holding   to   keep   her   steady   while   stepping   in   and   out   of   tub   or   the   shower   and   one   end   often   becomes   unsecure   and   moves   and   she   has   actually   fallen   because   of   that   sudden   change .   she   barely   weighs   98   lbs   and   is   certainly   not   applying   her   full   body   weight   .   we   really   wanted   these   to   work   because   the   alternative   is   having   a   contractor   from   the   local   medical   supply   come   out   and   install   stainless   steel   grab   bars .   but   thankfully   they   have   a   special   to   do   three   bars   for   125.00   and   the   work   is   licensed   and   guaranteed .   the   bonus   with   having   them   installed   was   the   fellow   had   been   doing   it   for   20   years   and   knew   exactly   how   to   do   it   and   what   bars   would   work   best   for   her   and   also   suggested   the   a   third   bar   outside   of   the   tub   shower   and   6   months   later   that   one   has   been   very   helpful   for   dressing   and   such .   maybe   these   work   best   with   tile   or   corien ,   etc .   they   do   not   work   well   with   prefabbed   fiberglass .   if   you   have   that   we   would   recommend   having   someone   with   expertise   put   some   reliable   bars   in   for   your   safety   and   peach   of   mind .   check   with   your   local   medical   supply   or   mobility   supply   store   and   see   if   they   offer   a   grab   bar   installation   service   and   have   any   specials   running .   we   were   so   unnerved   by   the   unreliability   of   these   two   devices   we   will   not   even   donate   them   lest   someone   else   risk   being   hurt .
we   love   this   carrier !   this   carrier   is   super   comfy   and   a   great   fit .   it   s   so   much   more   reasonably   priced   than   competitive   brands   and ,   in   my   opinion ,   more   comfortable .   my   husband   and   i   each   strap   one   of   our   twins   in   and   we   re   on   the   go ,   wherever   we   go !
wonderful   towel   this   is   a   great   towel   set   for   your   baby .   the   material   is   perfect   for   after   bath   time .   the   towel   is   a   good   size   and   quality   is   durable   so   i   know   it   will   last   through   the   toddler   years .
buyer   beware !   the   name   simplisse   must   be   french   for   many   ridiculous   steps   for   assembly   and   disassembly   and   miserable   to   clean .   there   are   14   steps   for   assembly   and   9   for   disassembly   with   so   many   nooks   and   crannies   to   clean .   i   can   t   believe   this   thing   is   even   on   the   market .   i   bought   mine   from   babies   r   us   and   it   can   t   be   returned   for   any   reason .   mine   malfunctioned   the   first   time   i   used   it .   the   rubber   valve   gets   sucked   in   the   up   position   preventing   milk   from   spilling   into   the   bottle .   the   only   recourse   is   to   contact   the   manufacturer   which   i   haven   t   done   yet .   we   ll   see   how   simplisse   that   proves   to   be .   buy   an   electric   breast   pump   that   allows   you   to   use   batteries .
  25   alternative   to   a   high   chair !   plus   it   s   portable !   works   for   me   we   didn   t   even   own   a   high   chair   for   our   baby ,   and   i   see   no   reason   to   spend   the   big   bucks   or   give   up   the   space   required   for   high   chairs .   plus ,   high   chairs   usually   have   cloth   cushions   which   i   do   not   understand   one   bit !   we   were   happy   using   this   instead .   i   love   that   every   bit   of   it   is   easy   to   clean   the   only   non   plastic   part   is   the   buckle   straps ,   which   yes   those   get   messy   too   sometimes   .   and   i   love   that   the   white   tray   is   removable   and   dish   washer   safe .   i   wish   it   had   multiple   white   trays   to   switch   out   while   the   other   is   in   the   wash ,   but   oh   well .   some   seats   are   hard   to   snap   the   tray   part   on   and   off ...   we   were   going   to   buy   a   different   seat   but   pulled   it   out   of   the   box   at   the   store   to   try   the   tray   and   it   was   so   hard   to   get   on   and   off .   we   tried   this   one   and   it   was   easy ,   so   we   ended   up   getting   this   seat   instead   and   i   m   glad   we   did .   we   also   tossed   this   chair   in   the   car   to   take   along   if   we   were   going   to   someone   s   house   it   was   very   handy .
it   s   decent   enough   the   crib   is   ok .   it   came   missing   several   screws   so   we   initially   had   to   bungee   the   lower   half   of   the   front   side   to   the   rest   in   order   to   hold   it   together ,   until   we   could   get   the   right   hardware .   also   there   s   a   pretty   obvious   dent   in   the   wood   on   the   back   rail   thing   the   piece   that   sticks   up   above   the   rest   .   if   it   d   been   my   first   baby   i   would   have   thrown   a   fit   and   sent   it   back ,   but   now   that   i   m   on   number   two   i   have   bigger   things   to   worry   about .   the   crib   is   otherwise   pretty   good   looking   and   solid .
keep   looking !   this   bathtub   leaks   and   can   really   only   be   used   in   the   regular   tub   or   shower .   the   tub   can   be   made   more   compact   for   storage ,   but   it   doesn   t   get   that   much   smaller ,   and   how   hard   is   it   to   store   a   bathtub   anyway   any   benefit   is   lost   in   the   fact   that   this   product   fails   to   do   the   one   thing   you   need   a   tub   to   do   hold   water !   even   after   caulking   it ,   it   still   leaks   such   a   shame .   the   sponge   is   nice   for   lining   the   bathroom   sink   for   quick   clean   ups   when   baby   is   small .   the   sling   is   a   nice   feature   and   my   babies ,   quite   actively   kicking   and   splashing   at   4   1   2   months ,   do   well   on   it .   overall ,   even   if   you   have   to   buy   a   sling   and   another   tub   separately ,   you   d   be   doing   better   with   that   option   than   you   would   getting   this   tub .

amazing   product ! !   i   bought   this   mattress   about   a   month   ago   for   my   baby   s   playpen   she   has   her   own   room ,   but   she   sleeps   at   nights   with   us .   mattress   is   perfect ,   not   hard   not   soft ,   just   perfect   she   loves   it .   most   of   the   time   she   sleeps   on   her   tummy ,   and   we   found   that   since   she   started   to   sleep   in   this   mattress ,   she   sleep   maybe   1   or   2   hours   more   than   her   usual   7   8   hrs .   thank   you   amazon   for   carrying   such   a   wonderful   product  
helps   soothe   my   son   i   love   this   so   much   more   than   the   soothie .   it   s   so   much   lighter   than   the   soothie   so   when   it   falls   out ,   it   doesn   t   wake   up   my   son   like   the   soothie .   also ,   it   doesn   t   over   up   my   son   s   face   like   the   ugly   soothie .   the   only   negative   thing   about   this   is   that   it   still   leave   marks   on   my   son   s   cheek ,   but   this   might   be   because   my   son   has   extra   large   chipmunk   cheeks .
crack   for   babies   when   i   was   prego   i   bought   every   kind   of   ortho   pacifiers   for   my   soon   to   be   baby   boy .   little   did   i   know   that   the   hospital   would   stick   a   binkie   in   my   baby   s   mouth   as   soon   as   he   came   out   to   the   world .   br   br   at   first   my   son   s   a   preemie   they   had   to   cut   a   portion   of   the   paci   so   it   didn   t   block   his   airway   this   thing   was   almost   1   2   the   size   of   his   head .   i   tried   switching   him   to   other   pacis ,   useless ,   either   he   couldn   t   grip   it ,   or   he   d   spit   it   out .   br   br   we   didn   t   have   any   problems   like   other   parents   with   him   latching   to   the   paci ,   only   to   breastfeed   but   if   you   do   have   problems   try   tickling   stroking   their   chin   jawline .   it   made   my   kiddo   open   up   to   feed ,   but   with   this   paci ,   i   think   he   could   smell   it   a   mile   away .   br   br   i   can   totally   see   why   he   d   like   this ,   the   nipple   is   shaped   like   a   real   nipple .   it   s   easy   for   them   to   use   and   get   full   suction   grip   on   it .   br   br   it   comes   in   a   variety   of   colors ,   but   for   some   reason ,   the   blue   ones   were   way   harder   thicker   than   the   green   ones .   my   son   won   t   use   any   of   them   other   than   the   green   ones .   there   s   also   a   paci   holder   it   s   really   cute ,   it   turns   the   paci   into   a   smiley   face   and   it   snaps   on   to   a   penguin   or   a   flower .   super   adorable .   br   br   what   i   don   t   like   br   after   we   left   the   hospital   we   only   snagged   3   of   these   pacis   they   were   hard   to   find .   every   chain   grocery   store   were   sold   out ,   and   what   we   did   find ,   we   bought   all   of .   as   soon   as   we   lost   one   or   couldn   t   give   one   to   my   son   when   he   needed   it ,   the   world   literally   would   end .   this   was   a   peace   offering   to   calm   a   very   tyrannical   baby .   so   i   m   glad   that   amazon   carries   it .   we   no   longer   have   to   keep   track   of   pacis   like   our   car   keys   and   wallet .   phew !   br   br   soothie   also   makes   bottles .   if   your   baby   has   a   hard   time   drinking   out   of   them   or   just   wouldn   t   latch   like   my   son   did   avent ,   maam ,   medela ,   gerber ,   nuk   then   get   their   bottles .   same   nipple   shape   and   comes   in   2   different   sizes .   br   br   teeth   br   my   son   is   almost   2   now   and   i   was   scared   that   because   these   were   ortho   pacis ,   that   he   d   have   buck   teeth   or   just   out   of   line .   i   m   wrong .   kid   has   straight   teeth .   he   still   uses   his   paci   in   the   morning   and   to   fall   asleep . f   line .   i   m   wrong .   kid   has   straight   teeth .   he   still   uses   his   paci   in   the   morning   and   to   fall   asleep .
wish   there   were   nubbies   around   the   nipple   what   i   like   it   is   the   same   as   her   green   soothie   pacifiers   so   it   fits   her   mouth   great   and   is   of   known   really   good   quality .   single   piece   design   is   nice ,   and   two   different   textures   on   the   sides   is   good   for   choice .   the   size   of   the   nipple   is   much   better   then   that   big   berry   nubby   thing   that   looks   like   a   ring   pacifier   that   is   way   too   big   for   her   mouth   and   the   nubs   all   over   the   nipple   part   seem   to   be   uncomfortable   for   her .   what   i   don   t   like   she   is   4   months   old   now ,   we   got   it   a   month   ago .   she   is   teething   and   chewing   on   things ,   but   could   not   hold   manipulate   this   until   recently   for   any   length   of   time .   wanted   a   nipple   that   she   would   suck   on   and   the   nubs   would   be   right   under   her   gums   if   she   bit   down   this   doesn   t   have   that ,   nubs   are   only   on   the   sides .   it   s   still   too   big   and   bulky   for   her   to   do   much   and   we   don   t   give   her   a   pacifier   during   the   day   now   except   at   naps .   so   this   was   a   bit   of   a   waste   of   money   for   us .   gave   it   3   stars   for   quality   but   it   s   really   not   proven   very   useful   for   our   family .
good   if   my   son   took   a   pacifier   my   son   didn   t   like   this   pacifier ,   but   he   doesn   t   like   any   pacifier .   i   love   that   it   s   orange   and   easy   to   spot   and   has   the   nose   notch   cut   out .   we   ll   be   saving   this   bink   for   the   next   baby   to   see   if   he   or   she   will   like   it .
great   teeth   and   snuggle   buddy   my   son   loves   to   teeth   with   this   wub   and   also   likes   to   snuggle   and   play   with   the   stuffed   animal   part .   a   great ,   great   buy   and   we   have   three   different   wubs !
cute ,   cuddly ,   and   keeps   paci   from   falling !   this   is   great   for   keeping   the   paci   from   popping   out   of   an   infant   s   mouth   and   onto   the   floor   it   just   stays   right   there   and   baby   quickly   learns   to   find   it   again   when   they   want   it .   br   the   paci   will   no   longer   bounce   across   the   floor   and   hide   under   furniture !   br   i   just   wish   my   son   took   a   paci   for   more   than   a   few   weeks !   br   great   shower   gift ! ! !   br   br   oh ,   and   to   clean   it ,   i   just   held   the   paci   part   under   hot   water ,   washed   it   with   soap ,   rinsed   well ,   and   pop   it   back   in   his   mouth .   when   the   cuddly   part   got   dirty ,   i   hand   washed   in   the   sink   air   dry   overnight .   good   reason   to   have   2 ! !  
most   natural   breast   like   pacy !   it   s   the   only   one   my   daughter   will   take   since   it   moves   in   and   out   like   a   women   s   breast   when   nursing ! !   highly   recommended   product ! ! !
we   wuv   wubbanubs !   i   love   these   wubbanub   pacifier   holders   for   my   twins .   we   swaddle   them   when   they   are   sleeping ,   put   the   pacifier   in   their   mouths ,   and   plop   the   wubbanub   on   their   chest   so   when   they   spit   out   the   pacifier ,   it   doesn   t   go   far   and   it   s   still   there   if   they   decide   they   want   to   suck   on   it   again .   the   best   part   is   that   they   come   with   soothie   pacifiers ,   which   are   perfect   for   a   newborn   s   small   mouth .   once   we   stopped   swaddling   them ,   the   fuzzy   animal   attachment   is   the   perfect   size   for   their   little   hands   to   play   with .
wished   i   d   got   this   sooner ...   at   9   months   old ,   i   feel   my   little   guy   might   be   a   tad   on   the   older   side   for   using   this   product .   it   s   recommended   up   to   six   months ,   but   i   m   sure   it   s   fine   for   the   older   babies   who   still   like   this   particular   pacifier .   br   br   my   son   isn   t   a   routine   user   of   the   soothie ,   just   occasionally   he   likes   to   suck   on   it   while   he   goes   to   sleep .   br   br   with   teething ,   though ,   he   d   become   very   distracted   by   the   soothie   in   his   mouth   wanting   to   bite   it   and   move   it   around   so   i   ordered   this   a   few   weeks   back   to   see   it   it   d   help   undistract   him .   br   br   it   did .   br   br   he   likes   resting   his   hand   on   the   dog   and   occasionally   chewing   the   dog   s   paws   as   he   falls   asleep   and   is   no   longer   roused   by   the   need   to   aggressively   teethe .
great   for   the   casual   pacifier   user ...   my   little   guy   had   turned   his   old ,   barely   used   soothies   into   teething   toys   recently   and   we   ve   caught   him   shoving   the   whole   darn   thing   in   his   mouth .   and   while   i   m   not   concerned   about   choking ,   it   was   clear   he   needed   something   more   .   br   br   as   soon   as   i   received   this ,   he   happily   took   to   it .   br   br   he   seems   to   enjoy   the   extra   material   for   holding   onto   it   while   he   moves   it   around   his   mouth .   br   br   it   isn   t   the   teething   golden   grail   of   a   toy   i   was   hoping   for ,   but   it   seems   to   be   a   nice   addition   to   his   chewing   things   collection .
maybe   too   good ...   my   2   month   old   has   been   using   these   since   day   4   when   we   needed   extra   help   consoling   her .   unfortunately   she   loves   it   so   much   that   it   is   difficult   to   have   her   nap   without   it ,   although   she   will   go   back   to   sleep   after   a   night   feed   without   it .   they   do   fall   out   easily   so   there   are   many   trips   back   to   her   crib   to   reinsert   the   gumdrop   but   that   is   the   sacrafice   i   make   for   getting   her   to   sleep   in   the   first   place .   she   doesn   t   wake   up   once   she   s   in   a   deep   enough   sleep   when   it   falls   out .   i   really   like   how   it   is   shaped   around   her   nose ,   giving   her   more   space   to   breathe .
my   daughter   s   favorite !   bought   these   for   my   daughter   because   they   were   not   only   adorable   but   they   are   great   at   night   because   they   usually   stayed   on   her   chest   when   the   paci   fell   out .   even   if   it   fell   to   the   side   of   her ,   they   are   so   easy   to   find   in   the   middle   of   the   night   when   you   re   half   asleep ! ! !   also   thought   they   would   be   great   for   her   to   hold   onto   when   she   gets   a   little   older
could   not   live   without   it   i   am   updating   my   initial   review   that   said   we   could   live   without   this   product ... we   cannot   live   without !   pros   cute   easy   to   find   the   pacifier   with   such   a   big   thing   attached   to   it   good   pattern   for   the   baby   to   look   at   will   hold   it   propped   in   her   mouth   if   she   s   really   really   tired   easy   to   grab ,   so   at   night   she   can   find   it   in   her   crib   and   pop   it   back   in   her   mouth !   cons   only   reason   i   m   giving   this   4   stars   paci   doesn   t   detach   so   the   animal   and   the   pacifier   have   to   go   into   the   washer   easy   for   baby   to   grab   and   she   pulls   it   out   of   her   mouth   all   the   time   i   would   buy   this   again   and   am   tempted   to   buy   a   second   one   just   in   case   we   lose   this   one ! !
small   these   are   smaller   than   i   thought   they   would   be .   i   didn   t   pay   attention   to   the   sizes   and   i   should   have .   the   large   one   would   only   fit   2 ,   maybe   3   all   in   one   cloth   diapers .   the   small   one   is   so   small   that   it   works   as   a   case   for   my   daughters   nintendo   ds .   you   couldn   t   even   fit   one   stay   dry   liner   in   it !   other   than   being   small   the   large   one   works   great !
cute   functional !   cute   pacifier ... everytime   xander   wears   this ,   everyone   does   a   double   take !   they   always   ask   where   i   got   this .   this   is   not   only   cute ,   but   well   made   is   surprisingly   my   9   month   old   s   favorite   pacifier !
high   expectations   my   2   month   old   son   is   a   breast   feeding   baby .   we   tried   all   kinds   of   differnt   passies   but   he   had   no   interest .   for   a   long   time   i   thought   that   he   just   wouldnt   take   one   but   then   we   tried   the   soothies   brand   and   he   loved   them .   the   only   problem   is   they   are   so   heavy   and   round   they   are   hard   tohold   in   his   mouth .   so   i   decided   to   try   these   sense   they   are   shaped   around   the   mouth ,   figuring   it   would   be   easier   for   him   to   hold   in .   unfortunetly   they   still   fall   out   on   a   regular   basis .   that   may   just   be   the   nature   of   this   kind   of   paci   but   it   drives   me   crazy   because   i   am   constantly   having   to   put   it   back   in .   but   my   son   does   love   it ... i   will   be   ordering   size   2
playtex   pacifier   for   older   babies   our   two   year   old   loves   this   design   but   it   is   very   hard   to   find .   thanks   to   amazon   she   s   happy   again !
good   idea ,   poor   quality !   i   loved   the   idea   to   have   a   portable   pacifier   sterilizer   for   my   little   one ,   however   after   a   couple   uses   the   middle   insert   came   off   and   the   product   does   not   work   anymore .   good   idea ,   poor   quality .
wish   the   pacifier   was   removable   great   idea ,   but   i   would   like   to   have   the   option   to   remove   the   pacifier   to   clean   it   or   switch   out .
not   my   favorite   i   have   alot   of   these   and   this   one   is   my   least   favorite   . it   rolls   right   off   my   baby   so   shes   always   losting   it . also   i   think   the   paci   should   be   down   more   , its   hard   for   her   to   keep   in   her   mouth . love   the   others
very   pleased !   i   have   the   lamb   wubbanub   for   my   daughter   and   i   bought   this   caterpillar   as   a   shower   gift   for   a   friend .   the   shipping   was   very   quick ,   maybe   2   days   the   package   was   new ,   and   it   all   looked   clean   and   neat .   she   really   liked   it !   as   for   the   product   itself ,   i   think   wubbies   are   really   great   pacifiers   for   different   reasons .   the   toy   serves   the   purpose   as   something   to   give   the   baby   to   do .   my   daughter   likes   to   chew   on   her   some   and   then   she   ll   put   the   paci   back   in   her   mouth .   using   the   wubbie ,   she   learned   just   how   to   put   it   back   in   her   mouth ,   which   is   very   nice .   it   s   also   hard   to   lose   a   wubbie !   i   hate   searching   underneath   the   crib ,   or   in   between   a   blanket   or   under   a   carseat   for   a   single   pacifier .   they   clean   easily ,   just   wash   in   the   gentle   cycle   and   air   dry .   they   also   get   lots   of   compliments .
adorable   pacifier   my   little   4   month   old   just   loves   this   pacifier .   i   give   it   to   her   when   she   goes   for   a   nap   or   bedtime .   she   will   just   hold   the   little   kitty   or   pet   it   while   sucking   on   the   pacifier .   i   was   a   little   disappointed   at   first   because   i   was   expecting   the   kitty   to   be   bigger .   but   it   s   the   perfect   size   for   my   baby .   it   s   worth   the   money .   i   m   getting   ready   to   order   another   one .
not   what   is   pictured   the   picture   is   not   exact .   the   pacifiers   in   the   picture   are   the   only   ones   my   daughter   will   use .   however   these   seem   to   work   just   as   well .   the   picture   is   of   a   plastic   center   pacifier ,   the   ones   we   recieved   the   nipple   runs   throught   the   center   to   the   other   side .
don   t   actually   have   to   replace   that   often   i   haven   t   had   a   chance   to   try   this   yet ,   but   i   like   that   it   s   all   natural ,   one   piece ,   and   made   to   support   breastfeeding   the   large   flat   shield   is   large   on   purpose   so   it   touches   the   baby   s   nose   as   in   bfing   though   this   might   not   work   well   for   all   babies   .   i   noticed   a   lot   of   reviewers   mentioned   how   you   have   to   replace   it   so   often ,   which   worried   me   at   first ,   too ,   b   c   of   the   price .   but   on   the   manufacturer   s   website ,   they   say   that   while   they   have   to   have   that   recommendation   on   their   packaging   due   to   european   standards ,   you   don   t   actually   have   to   replace   it   nearly   that   often .   they   also   mention   that   it   may   whiten   after   sterilizing ,   but   will   return   to   its   normal   color   in   a   few   days ,   and   that   it   may   turn   brown   over   time   which   is   also   totally   normal   b   c   it   s   natural   rubber   and   oxidizes .   just   wanted   to   help   clear   things   up !
beautiful ,   but   major   choking   hazard   i   splurged   on   this   item   for   my   daughter   two   years   ago ,   but   she   used   it   maybe   6   or   8   times ,   as   she   never   took   a   pacifier .   i   love   haba   products   in   general   and   have   always   found   them   to   be   of   really   high   quality .   my   son   is   now   9   mos   old   and   we   ve   used   this   pacifier   tether   maybe   3   or   4   dozen   times .   i   have   never   seen   him   chewing   on   the   beads   or   string ,   just   the   soothie   teething   pacifier   attached   to   the   end   of   it .   the   other   day ,   while   it   was   attached   to   his   onesie   and   he   was   tugging   on   it ,   the   string   gave   way ,   sending   beads   flying   all   over   the   room .   he   of   course   put   some   in   his   mouth   immediately .   it   looks   like   a   knot   hidden   within   the   beadwork   came   undone ,   but   i   m   not   sure .   i   am   grateful   i   was   there   and   he   was   not   hurt .   i   notified   haba   and   the   cpsc   of   the   potential   choking   hazard .   haba   responded   quickly   and   professionally   by   email   and   phone ,   including   a   request   that   the   pieces   be   sent   to   them   for   further   investigation .   the   cpsc   called   me   in   response   to   my   online   report   and   told   me   that   because   of   prior   complaints ,   they   have   an   ongoing   investigation   into   these   pacifier   chains ,   and   they   are   sending   someone   out   to   interview   me   and   take   photos   of   the   pieces   before   they   are   sent   back   to   the   manufacturer .   it   is   a   really   nice   wooden   alternative   to   some   of   the   other   paci   tethers   out   there ,   but   until   they   figure   out   whatever   the   problem   is ,   and   if   it   can   be   fixed ,   i   can   not   recommend   it   to   anyone .
pointless   buy   this   is   one   of   those   tings   new   mommies   look   at   and   wonder ,   how   did   my   parents   ever   survive   without   one   of   those   then   you   buy   it   and   you   quickly   learn   it   s   because   it   s   completely   useless .   i   ended   up   keeping   the   binky   on   a   clip   that   hooked   to   the   baby   s   clothes   whenever   we   went   out .   this   kept   it   from   falling ,   and   also   made   it   unnecessary   for   me   to   use   a   bag   at   all .   if   i   needed   to   put   it   away ,   i   just   threw   it   in   the   diaper   bag   which   is   clean ,   and   i   m   not   a   germaphobe   .   br   br   also ,   the   snap   on   the   loop   always   came   open ,   so   i   couldn   t   trust   it   on   the   diaper   bag   strap .   that   s   the   whole   reason   i   thought   it   d   be   cool ... so   i   didn   t   have   to   dig   through   the   diaper   bag   for   the   binky .   but   i   ended   up   having   to   keep   it   in   the   bag   anyway   because   it   would   just   fall   off .   br   br   now   my   older   son   thinks   it   s   a   cute   purse   and   shoves   little   things   in   it .
great   product   wubbanubs   have   been   wonderful   for   my   little   one .   he   loves   them   and   his   soothies ,   so   i   had   no   problem   with   the   soothie   being   attached .   and   even   though   he   s   still   a   little   young   to   fully   grasp   them ,   they   re   big   enough   for   him   to   hug   easily   and   hold   on   to   them   that   way .   it   s   been   great   not   to   have   to   worry   as   much   about   pacis   falling   on   the   floor .   this   one   is   really   cute   and   one   of   our   favorites .   i   guess   if   i   had   a   complaint ,   i   d   ask   to   have   more   beans   or   filling   in   them   to   make   them   a   tab   bit   heavier .

nice   concept ,   but   not   ideal   for   baby   the   concept   is   nice ,   but   as   other   reviewers   pointed   out ,   it   closes   as   it   hits   something ,   not   before .   my   bigger   problem   with   it   is   that   it   s   hard ,   and   not   soft   like   most   other   pacifiers ,   so   his   face   can   get   red   while   sucking   on   this .   if   he   were   to   hit   something   with   it   in   his   mouth ,   he   could   probably   get   really   hurt ,   so   we   just   don   t   use   this   because   of   that .

son   loves   it !   these   are   super   cute   my   son   loves   it !   i   was   super   anti   pacifier   when   my   son   was   born ,   but   after   he   kept   giving   himself   hickies   on   his   arms   from   sucking   so   hard ,   i   changed   my   mind .   he   took   to   this   right   away   at   about   7   weeks   old   and   now   at   13   weeks   he   holds   it   and   pushes   it   in   his   mouth   himself   too   cute !   if   your   baby   like   soothies   the   ones   most   hospitals   use   then   i   highly   recommend   you   get   this !   we   had   no   issues   with   nipple   confusion   he   still   nurses   like   a   champ .

giraffe   pacifier   i   love   this   pacifier ... and   so   does   my   infant !   i   received   the   catepillar   one   as   a   gift   and   absolutely   needed   another   one   in   my   life   because   it   s   so   great .   babies   are   not   adept   at   holding   a   pacifier   by   themselves ,   so   this   makes   it   so   much   easier   as   the   textured   fabric ,   when   set   against   babies   clothes   blanket   side   of   crib   allows   it   stay   put .   keeps   baby   happy   and   mom   too   as   i   don   t   have   to   constantly   be   putting   it   back   in   her   mouth .
not   as   good   as   the   other   avent   pacifiers   my   son   really   likes   the   avent   pacifiers   that   is   shaped   like   a   sideways   figure   8 .   those   have   air   flow   and   doesn   t   squash   my   son   s   nose .   however   with   this   one ,   if   my   son   puts   it   in   upside   down ,   it   will   squish   my   son   s   nose .   i   read   about   the   length   of   time   the   glow   in   the   dark   feature   lasts ,   and   all   of   the   reviews   are   correct ... it   doesn   t   last   that   long .   i   think   the   sideways   figure   8   avent   pacifiers   are   better .
a   good   pacifier   for   newborns   we   weren   t   sure   at   first   if   we   were   going   to   use   pacifiers .   i   didn   t   want   to   have   the   problem   of   having   to   keep   putting   it   back   in   for   him   to   sleep .   however ,   we   found   a   happy   medium   in   using   them .   they   really   are   a   great   transitional   piece .   what   i   mean   is   if   you   are   in   the   car   and   he   s   hungry   and   you   need   to   buy   10   15   minutes   to   get   home   to   nurse ,   letting   him   suck   on   the   pacifier   will   keep   him   from   a   total   meltdown .   it   also   is   invaluable   if   he   has   missed   his   sleep   window   and   needs   the   soothing   of   sucking   to   settle   him   down .   we   tried   the   other   kind   that   has   the   wider   rubber   piece ,   but   i   found   it   would   make   him   gag .   i   bought   these   at   the   grocery   store   late   one   night   when   we   were   desperate   and   couldn   t   find   our   others   and   this   one   was   hospital   recommended .   they   are   a   good   pacifier .   a   few   drawbacks   to   me   is   the   little   handle   can   be   awkward   and   the   breathing   holes   aren   t   very   big .   having   said   that   he   had   a   easier   time   using   this   one   than   any   others   and   the   nipple   wasn   t   too   big   for   him   as   a   newborn .   now   we   only   use   it   occasionally   when   we   need   to   buy   some   time   to   get   home   and   he   s   hungry   or   tired .   be   careful   not   to   keep   these   lying   around   where   pets   can   get   to   them ,   because   we   have   found   our   cats   love   to   chew   on   these !
just   not   for   us   loved   the   idea   of   all   natural   rubber   but   my   son   hated   this   orthodontic   paci .   he   is   a   breastfed   baby   and   would   gag   every   time   i   put   this   in   his   mouth .   i   did   however   get   him   to   use   the   rounded   version   of   this   pacifier ,   i   suggest   if   your   little   one   doesnt   like   the   orthodontic   paci   that   you   give   the   rounded   version   a   try
poor   product   good   idea   put   poorly   made .   the   medicine   leaks   out   and   the   pacifier   part   is   very   hard .   my   daughter   rejected   it   immediately !   went   with   another   brand .
great   monitor   gives   us   piece   of   mind   i   debated   about   whether   to   spend   this   much   for   a   monitor .   i   am   so   glad   i   did .   before   the   monitor ,   we   would   pop   into   the   room   constantly   to   check   on   our   baby .   our   floors   would   creek   at   times   and   wake   her   up !   now ,   we   just   use   the   monitor   to   peek   in   on   her   while   we   are   in   the   living   room .   the   zoom   in   feature   is   great !   love   it !
great   gate   daycare   approved   great   gate   has   held   up   very   well ,   easy   enough   for   the   older   children   to   open   but   not   the   younger   ones .   is   not   a   gate   you   want   to   take   down   everyday ,   i   just   use   velcro   to   hold   it   open   after   daycare   hours .   if   you   take   it   down   each   time   you   have   to   square   it   up   when   you   put   it   back   up .   very   sturdy   and   nice   looking ,   have   got   alot   of   compliments   on   this   gate .
evenflo   big   kid   dlx   booster   seat   this   is   a   excellent   booster   seat .   as   a   child   passenger   safety   seat   instructor   i   see   all   the   brands   on   the   market   and   this   evenflo   seat   really   exceeds   our   needs   and   requirements .   i   have   a   4   year   old   son   and   this   booster   seat   is   actually   a   replacement   for   a   seat   that   was   in   a   substantial   car   crash .   when   looking   for   a   child   restraint   seat   always   make   sure   that   you   find   a   restraint   seat   that   meets   your   child   s   needs   height   and   weight   and   one   that   you   can   use   correctly   every   time .   cost   is   also   an   important   factor   when   choosing   the   proper   restraint   seat ,   what   we   did   was   went   to   the   retail   stores   found   the   seat   we   wanted   and   then   went   to   amazon   were   we   saved   approx .   25.00   plus   we   received   free   shipping .
great !   this   is   a   great   potty   seat !   it   fits   great   to   the   seat   as   it   adjusts   to   fit   snug .   it   doesn   t   slide   around   on   the   seat   like   other   ones   i   ve   purchased .   i   love   it !
my   niece   loves   this   i   purchased   this   for   my   niece   who   was   expecting   her   first   child .   she   loves   this   bag ,   large   enough   for   all   of   her   baby   s   needs   but   not   bulky .
no   more   sore   knees !   loved   this   mat !   bathtime   is   not   as   hard   to   manage   now .   my   son   loves   his   bath   and   likes   to   stay   in   for   awhile ,   now   that   i   have   this   i   can   enjoy   it   with   him .
great   service   i   received   this   item   less   than   24   hours   after   ordering   it .   unbelievably   fast   service .   and   the   pacifier   is   adorable .   my   daughter   loves   to   grab   the   caterpillar   and   hold   it   up   close   to   her   face .   she   isn   t   good   at   getting   the   pacifier   back   in   her   mouth   but   she   just   turned   3   months .
good   seat   but   very   big   and   bulky   the   seat   has   all   the   features   one   would   expect .   however   it   is   very   large   and   heavy   for   a   car   seat   and   might   even   leave   you   with   big   blindspots   when   you   are   looking   to   turn .   also ,   it   has   a   lot   of   man   made   material   which   makes   it   extremely   hot .   good   idea ,   just   make   it   much   lighter   and   thinner .
found   my   new   seat   i   originally   bought   the   saftey   first   air   protect   when   my   9   month   old   outgrew   her   infant   car   seat   about   a   month   ago .   i   ended   up   returning   the   air   protect   for   the   following   reasons   1   it   did   not   fit   well   in   the   rear   facing   position   in   the   back   middle   seat   in   our   2005   nissan   pathfinder .   the   front   seats   had   to   be   scooted   up   concomfortably   close   to   the   dash   and   the   car   seat   was   still   not   100   level   to   ground   due   to   the   length   of   the   car   seat .   it   was   also   very   difficult   to   tighten   properly   even   when   i   kneeled   on   the   seat   and   yanked   with   all   my   might .   2   the   straps   were   constantly   getting   twisted .   probably   every   other   time   i   put   her   in   our   took   her   out   i   was   untwisting   those   !   straps .   a   safety   issue   no .   but   a   real   pain   in   the   butt   when   errand   running   is   already   inconvenient   enough   yes .   3   in   the   beginning ,   my   daughter   cried   every   time   i   put   her   in   it .   she   just   did   not   seem   to   be   entirely   comfortable   in   it .   when   i   received   the   advocate   cs   and   opened   the   smashed   box ,   my   heart   sank   because   it   is   a   huge   seat   and   i   did   not   think   it   would   fit   any   better   than   the   air   protect .   fortunately ,   i   was   wrong   and   the   advocate   installed   very   easily   and   with   plenty   of   room   to   spare .   i   was   able   to   tighten   the   seat   very   tightly ,   i   think   due   to   having   tightening   straps   on   both   sides .   i   did   have   to   use   a   towel   underneath   to   make   the   base   level   which   was   also   the   case   with   the   air   protect   .   the   straps   have   yet   to   twist   and   my   daughter   s   head   rests   in   a   comfortable   position .   the   seat   is   very   cushy   yet   supportive   and   the   adjustable   straps   are   definitely   a   plus .   this   car   seat   is   simply   a   cut   above   the   rest .   it   has   all   of   the   best   safety   features   with   little   extras   belly   pad ,   recline   lever ,   easy   remove   seat   cover ,   etc   that   make   it   an   easy   seat   to   use   and   own .   yes ,   it   is   heavy   21   pounds   ,   but   it   weighs   less   than   my   daughter   so   that   is   not   an   issue   for   me .   and   yes ,   it   is   expensive   but   in   my   opinion   a   car   seat   is   not   an   area   to   look   for   a   bargain .   i   am   very   happy   with   this   seat   andam   relieved   that   the   stress   of   trying   to   find   the   perfect   car   seat   for   our   daughter   is   over .
depends   on   the   baby ,   but   overall   nice   product   how   much   you   will   like   these   bumpers   depends   what   you   want   them   to   do   and   how   much   your   baby   moves .   i   got   these   bumpers   when   my   daughter   was   about   6   months   old .   i   had   previously   purchased   a   bedding   set   that   came   with   traditional   padded   bumpers .   for   the   first   4   5   months   or   so ,   she   didn   t   really   move   all   that   much ,   so   the   bumpers   didn   t   really   serve   any   purpose .   but   once   she   started   really   moving   around   the   crib   at   night   i   ran   into   two   opposing   problems .   sometimes   she   would   end   up   with   her   face   in   the   bumper ,   which   would   scare   the   heck   out   of   me   so   i   took   the   bumpers   off .   but   then   she   would   get   her   arms   and   legs   stuck   through   the   slats   of   the   crib .   so   i   would   put   the   bumpers   back   on ,   but   end   up   worrying   about   smothering .   br   br   i   was   looking   for   something   that   would   solve   these   problems   and   the   breathable   bumpers   did   the   trick .   i   no   longer   worried   about   airflow   or   smothering ,   and   her   arms   and   legs   were   kept   inside   the   crib .   i   ve   been   happy   enough   with   these   bumpers ,   but   they   are   a   little   difficult   to   get   on   tightly .   and   they   are   easily   collapsible ,   so   baby   can   throw   an   arm   or   leg   over   top   of   one ,   if   they   are   so   coordinated   or   lucky .   these   are   definitely   not   going   to   keep   baby   from   whacking   a   head   against   a   side ,   so   if   that   is   your   problem ,   these   bumpers   won   t   help   they   are   not   padded .   br   br   i   think   these   are   a   good   buy   for   people   in   my   situation   baby   likes   to   stick   limbs   through   the   slats ,   but   you   worry   about   airflow .   they   work   best   when   installed   perfectly ,   which   can   be   difficult .   but   they   have   worked   well   for   me .
you   only   get   1   watch   out   this   product   only   comes   with   one   replacement   nipple .   for   only   a   few   dollars   more   you   get   the   actual   sippy   cup   much   more   worth   the   money .   i   thought   this   was   a   pack   of   three ,   big   mistake .   i   was   going   to   get   two   packages ,   but   a   good   thing   i   didnt .   if   i   had   it   to   do   again ,   i   wouldnt   have   made   the   purchase .
love   it !   worth   the   price   and   quite   spacious .   i   can   take   it   with   me   wherever   i   go   and   baby   is   not   excluded   because   he   can   see   through   the   mesh   sides .   really   happy   with   this   purchase .
gets   moldy   fast !   this   does   indeed   deflect   the   water   for   a   softer   waterfall   flow   but   it   was   full   of   mold   mildew   in   less   than   a   month !   the   part   that   the   water   hits   first   when   it   comes   out   of   the   spout   the   deflector   has   a   tiny   hole   that   is   supposed   to   drain   any   water   that   pools   there .   this   hole   drains   too   slowly   and   is   ineffective   at   preventing   mold   mildew   from   growing .   as   i   speak   the   hole   is   entirely   black   and   the   area   around   it   is   covered   in   mildew   as   well .   it   s   not   just   where   the   water   hits   directly ,   either .   we   removed   the   deflector   to   soak   it   in   bleach   and   the   entire   interior   part   that   rests   on   the   metal   spout   was   also   covered   in   mildew .   this   is   a   difficult   area   to   clean   as   it   s   has   little   ridges   and   dents   and   pockets   and   the   material   is   a   somewhat   flexible   rubber   so   it   cannot   just   be   wiped   clean .   we   soaked   it   in   a   bucket   of   bleach   for   a   day   or   two   and   scrubbed   it   and   got   it   looking   acceptable ,   but   still   off   color   and   in   less   than   a   week   all   the   mildew   was   back .   we   have   good   ventilation   in   our   bathroom   so   that   s   not   the   issue .   only   buy   this   if   you   plan   to   remove   it   and   thoroughly   dry   it   by   hand   after   every   bath .   it   also   did   not   fit   my   water   spout   very   well   and   i   have   a   very   standard   spout .   it   did   fit   in   the   end   but   seemed   off .   as   of   now ,   every   bath   my   daughter   takes   is   full   of   water   that   has   passed   through   mildew   and   mold   on   its   way   into   the   tub   which   is   gross   so   i   am   removing   it   and   getting   rid   of   it .   i   won   t   be   buying   another   one .
great   lunchbox !   i   bought   this   lunchbox   for   school   for   my   8   year   old   son .   it   seems   to   be   pretty   well   made   and   it   has   a   long   shoulder   strap   that   is   adjustable .   i   cannot   find   any   negative   aspects   to   this   purchase ,   i   am   completely   satisfied   with   it   and   would   recommend   it   to   anyone   looking   for   a   spongebob   squarepants   lunchbox .
love   it   very   practical   on   sunny   day   and   the   system   work   well ,   a   bit   sort   but   i   am   happy
worth   the   money   probably   the   most   expensive   pacifier   i   ve   bought   but   worth   it .   it   definitely   helps   the   pacifier   from   flying   out   of   my   baby   s   mouth .   he   can   also   hold   on   to   it   too   while   it   s   in   his   mouth .   i   get   a   lot   of   compliments   that   is   so   cute .   where   did   you   get   that   .   i   wonder   if   having   the   cute   animal   attached   to   the   pacifier   will   make   it   harder   for   my   baby   to   give   up   the   pacifier   later   i   guess   we   ll   cross   that   bridge   when   we   come   to   it .
great   product !   this   product   is   softer   than   what   you   can   buy   at   our   local   stores .   good   product .   very   pleased .
don   t   leave   home   without   them !   oh   yeah ,   these   are   a   winner .   we   just   run   them   thru   the   dishwasher   every   now   and   then   on   the   sanitizing   cycle .   works   like   a   charm .
best   pacifier   out   there !   5   stars   for   this   pacifier !   br   br   my   little   one   cannot   fall   asleep   without   it .   br   she   s   not   a   big   pacifier   user   only   right   before   bed   to   fall   asleep   but   she   will   not   use   any   other   pacifier .
this   pacifier   is   wonderful .   my   granddaughter   was   in   the   nicu   unit   for   11   days . the   pacifier   that   is   connected   to   the   caterpillar   is   the   kind   they   used . when   she   came   home ,   she   would   not   use   any   pacifier   my   son   and   his   wife   offered   her .   then   in   church ,   they   saw   a   baby   with   a   wubbanub   and   how   happy   the   baby   was .   we   searched   and   found   the   cutsie   caterpillar   at   a   store ,   but   it   was   the   only   one .   anyway ,   when   they   put   this   pacifier   in   her   mouth ,   she   was   so   content   and   she   actually   held   it   to   her   mouth   by   the   caterpillar . it   was   such   a   blessing .   with   the   cutsie   caterpillar   attached ,   it   stays   in   the   mouth   easier   and   when   you   need   to   set   it   aside ,   it   keeps   it   from   landing   on   the   pacifier . it   is   a   wonderful   product . thank   you ! !
nice   to   have   nice   to   have   as   now   i   can   keep   my   binkies   in   one   place   but   this   isn   t   realy   necessary .   still ,   it   s   nice   to   have   one   and   the   strap   has   a   snap   on   one   end   so   you   can   attach   it   to   your   diaper   bag .
great   pacifier   it   s   a   great   pacifier ,   my   daughter   like   it .   howewer ,   if   you   want   to   buy   it   because   it   glows   at   night ,   just   buy   the   regulars ,   the   glow   doesn   t   last   more   than   6   minutes .
perfect   diaper   bag   size   the   big   bag   is   perfect   size   for   diaper   bag ,   for   diapers ,   wet   clothes ,   and   it   actually   is   waterproof   i   had   my   doubts   .   the   little   pacifier   bag   is   useless   for   us   but   my   son   the   helpful   big   brother   likes   that   he   has   a   bag   that   matches   my   bag .   the   drawstring   is   very   easy   to   tighten   and   loosen ,   but   stays   nice   and   tight   when   closed .
great   for   pacifiers   and   hands !   these   are   wonderful   to   have   around   not   only   to   clean   the   pacifier   but   also   to   clean   my   5   month   old   s   hands   when   we   are   out   and   about .   she   is   constantly   putting   her   hands   in   her   mouth   so   i   love   having   a   something   on   hand   that   i   know   is   safe   for   her .
mango   monkey   is   the   softest   wubbanub   ever !   we   ve   gone   through   our   share   of   wubbanubs   but   i   just   had   to   take   the   time   to   comment   on   the   velour   textures   of   the   mango   monkey   mary   meyer   wubbanub ! ! !   definitely   worth   the   price   for   this   one ! !
love   the   wubbanub   i   had   the   giraffe   on   my   registry   and   received   it   as   a   gift ...   i   m   so   glad   i   did   because   my   son   loves   these   wubbanubs .   he   won   t   take   the   other   pacifiers   i   tried .   it   is   just   a   soothie ,   sure ...   but   my   son   loves   hugging   the   giraffe   and   the   bear   and   it   definitely   makes   my   life   a   tiny   bit   easier   because   these   do   not   fall   to   the   ground   every   time   it   falls   out   of   his   mouth .   they   re   adorable   too .   i   only   wish   there   was   a   way   to   throw   the   plush   part   into   the   washer   and   dryer .   i   don   t   mind   hand   washing   but   air   drying   takes   too   long !   that   s   why   i   had   to   order   the   bear   so   he   d   have   a   spare .   would   definitely   buy   again .
caused   our   baby   to   choke !   this   product   deserves   zero   stars .   any   liquid   medicine   flows   quickly   from   the   pacifier   tip ,   causing   baby   to   choke   from   the   rapid   influx   of   liquid .   the   pacifier   is   also   hard   rubber   hard   like   an   eraser   or   the   sole   of   a   shoe   that   the   baby   can   t   even   chew   on   like   a   normal   pacifier .   we   were   terrified   when   my   baby   began   to   choke   the   instant   we   put   it   in   her   mouth .   we   watched   her   for   several   scary   minutes   as   she   coughed   and   gasped   for   air .   i   thought   that   we   would   have   to   take   her   to   the   emergency   room ,   but   thankfully ,   i   am   a   rn   and   was   able   to   whack   her   back   and   hold   her   in   a   downward   position   in   order   to   help   clear   the   liquid   from   her   airway .   we   immediately   tossed   this   piece   of   junk   where   it   belongs   in   the   garbage .   it   s   shameful   that   they   call   it   hospital   choice   when   no   hospital   in   their   right   mind   or   with   the   right   malpractice   insurance   would   expose   infants   to   such   an   inherent   risk   of   aspirating   medicine   directly   into   their   lungs !
possible   choking   hazard   none   available .
fun   product .   the   product   is   really   neat ,   i   saw   it   in   an   article   and   bought   it   for   my   child   that   is   not   born   yet .   i   think   it   will   be   a   nice   item   for   the   baby   if   the   baby   takes   a   pacifier .
counting   sheep   this   sheep   with   pacifier   is   now   part   of   a   small   flock   that   graces   the   headboard   of   my   bed .   i   enjoy   them   very   much .
unimpressed   this   seems   to   just   be   a   stuffed   animal   glued   to   a   soothie .   my   baby   had   absolutely   no   interest   in   cuddling   with   the   kitten ,   and   the   kitten   does   nothing   to   hold   in   the   pacifier .   maybe   if   she   were   more   interested   in   the   kitten   it   would   work ,   but   i   was   basically   unimpressed   with   this   product .
love ,   love ,   love   it !   i   love   this   thing !   my   9wk   old   son   rolls   to   his   side   to   sleep ,   and   the   wubbanub   stays   tucked   in   his   arms   he   can   get   the   paci   back   in   his   mouth   by   himself ,   saving   me   many   trips   into   his   room  
best   binky   ever ! ! !   just   like   the   gerber   soft   center   bigger   bulb !   we   bought   every   binky   known   to   man   for   my   daughter ,   and   she   was   not   having   any   of   them .   i   could   tell   she   wanted   one ,   but   just   couldn   t   find   the   right   way   to   suck   on   any .   by   the   grace   of   god ,   we   found   one   our   first   daughters   binkys   mixed   it   with   her   baby   clothes .   she   took   right   to   it .   we   were   so   happy .   it   was   the   gerber   soft   center   pacifier   in   the   big   round   bulb   shape .   i   looked   for   5   months   everywhere   for   the   same   binky .   no   luck .   i   even   called   gerber ,   and   the   lady   lied   to   me   saying   they   never   sold   a   bigger   version   of   this   kind   of   binky .   she   said   it   must   have   swollen   to   that   size .   please .   i   have   read   quite   a   few   blogs   about   other   moms   trying   to   find   the   same   bigger   version .   makes   me   wonder   what   they   are   hidding .... i   was   so   frustrated   and   ready   to   give   up .   finaly   i   came   across   this   site   and   it   looked   very   similar   to   hers .   after   i   read   2   reviews   saying   the   same   thing   about   the   gerber   binkys ,   i   thought   it   was   worth   a   try .   as   soon   as   i   gave   it   to   her ,   she   loved   it ! !   yea ! ! !   i   also   love   the   fact   that   it   is   one   piece   and   natural .   i   have   read   about   another   mommy   who   has   this   for   her   kids   and   she   says   you   most   certianly   can   go   longer   then   4   6   weeks   to   replace .
2   of   these   2   large   bags   2   pacifier   bags   for   1   some   folks   complained   about   how   small   the   2nd   bag   is .   i   ordered   two   of   these   at   5.99   per   set .   that   means   i   paid   11.98   for   two   large   bags   plus   2   pacifier   bags ,   which   imo   is   a   better   deal   than   the   10.99   large   bag   2   pack .   i   wanted   a   way   to   hold   pacifiers ,   and   at   3   8   each ,   i   thought   pacifier   cases   were   the   biggest   ripoff .   this   set   is   so   worth   it .   the   blue   and   the   green   neutral   prints   are   really   cute !   i   m   buying   more   of   these   sets   for   my   pregnant   sister   and   cousin .  
so   glad   i   found   these !   i   searched   everywhere   locally   for   a   one   piece ,   non   latex ,   and   bpa   free   binky .   i   finally   decided   to   look   online ,   and   ordered   these   for   my   daughter .   i   love   them !   my   daughter   doesn   t   naturally   take   to   any   pacifier ,   so   we   had   to   encourage   them   for   a   few   days .   now   she   loves   them   too .   i   buy   them   as   gifts   and   recommend   them   to   everyone   i   know .
a   cheap   way   to   take   care   of   a   used   diaper .   this   dual   pack   was   perfect   for   our   needs .   we   use   the   bigger   bag   for   used   diapers   when   we   re   on   the   go ,   and   my   wife   uses   the   smaller   bag   for   reusable   pads .   the   other   reviews   are   right   that   the   smaller   bag   is   pretty   small ,   you   can   t   use   it   for   diapers .   br   br   the   diaper   bag   did   smell   a   little   after   holding   a   diaper   for   a   couple   hours ,   but   we   just   throw   the   bag   in   the   wash   and   it   comes   out   just   fine .   br   br   the   only   reason   i   gave   this   4   stars   was   because   it   would   have   been   nice   if   these   had   zippers ,   not   drawstring .   however ,   the   drawstring   does   a   good   job   so   it   s   definitely   not   a   deal   breaker .
life   saver   i   introduced   this   to   my   son   at   three   weeks .   he   wouldn   t   take   a   larger   pacifier ,   but   this   is   small   enough   to   fit   well   in   his   mouth ,   and   light   enough   that   it   won   t   fall   out   unless   he   pushes   it   out .   water   does   get   in   it   when   you   clean   it ,   but   it   takes   half   a   second   to   squeeze   it   out .   we   got   one   as   a   shower   gift ,   i   ve   ordered   two   more ,   and   i   m   thinking   of   getting   more .
best   teether   by   far !   my   daughter   started   teething   at   3   months   and   we   had   great   difficulty   finding   a   teether   that   she   liked .   after   trying   the   ring   and   the   hand ,   we   fell   upon   the   teething   blanket .   best   ever !   it   s   soft   and   fuzzy   and   silky   satiny   with   2   chewy   corners .   she   loves   grabbing   the   blankie   and   chewing   on   the   ends .   it   rocks ! !
the   baby   loves   her   wubby !   i   m   not   sure   who   loves   this   wubby   the   best ... me   or   my   baby   daughter .   the   weight   of   the   kitty   cat   helps   keep   the   pacifier   from   falling   out ,   which   allows   me   some   interruption   free   sleep   at   night .   now   that   she   is   a   little   older   almost   4   months   ,   she   likes   to   play   with   it ,   and   strokes   her   hands   over   it   while   she   is   sucking   the   pacifier .   when   it   does   fall   out   of   her   mouth ,   she   tries   to   put   it   back   in ,   although   at   this   point   she   usually   ends   up   sucking   on   a   leg   or   tail   instead .   this   little   guy   might   seem   a   tad   expensive   for   what   it   is ,   but   i   would   buy   another   one   in   a   heartbeat   if   this   one   got   lost .   the   kitty   cat   is   very   well   sewn .   my   baby   tugs   and   pulls   at   the   legs ,   and   the   stitching   is   holding   up   perfectly .   i   m   not   sure   exactly   how   the   soothie   pacifier   is   attached ,   but   it   is   still   attached   after   about   3   months   of   use .   i   ve   also   tossed   it   in   the   washing   machine   a   couple   of   times   in   a   mesh   bag   and   drip   dried   it .
terrible   smell ! ! !   thanks   god   i   try   first   one   not   on   pacifier .   smell   which   appears   was   so   terrible   and   strong   that   i   have   to   open   the   window   and   wipe   the   surface   with   alcohol   pads   several   times   to   kill   it !   i   put   all   the   rest   wipes   to   the   garbage   immediately !
the   only   ones   i   buy   after   trying   every   brand   out   there ,   we   are   a   committed   mam   family .   i   love   them   because   she   loves   them ,   but   even   more ,   she   uses   the   outside   when   teething .   i   love   a   product   that   serves   more   than   one   purpose !
my   baby   loves   his   wubbanub !   my   baby   has   had   the   brown   bear   wubbanub   from   the   very   beginning .   it   is   too   cute .   it   was   so   easy   for   him   to   handle   when   he   was   smaller ,   and   we   never   had   to   worry   about   him   losing   it .   he   is   17   months   old   now   and   does   not   use   the   soothie   anymore ,   but   he   still   has   to   hold   the   wubbanub   in   his   hand   before   he   can   go   to   sleep .
great !   my   son   has   loved   his   soothies   since   the   day   he   was   born   but   always   had   trouble   keeping   them   in   his   mouth   dropping   them   and   such .   i   bought   a   soothie   pacifier   holder   the   honey   pot   one   but   that   item   failed   us .   soon   after   i   ordered   this   wubbanub   my   son   s   first   nick   name   was   monkey   at   3   months   and   even   at   6   months   old ,   he   loves   it   and   uses   it   as   security   blanket   ,   if   you   will .   he   plays   with   it   and   it   s   very   easy   for   him   to   hold   on   to   and   put   in   his   mouth   on   his   own .   he   also   gets   tons   of   compliments   on   it !   it   s   good   to   the   both   of   us .   i   definitely   suggest   this   product   to   all   mamas !   br   br   edit   my   son   is   now   nearly   2   years   old .   we   weened   him   off   this   pacifier   the   only   one   he   would   use   at   about   12   months   by   cutting   the   soothie   out   of   the   monkey   mouth   and   sewing   the   mouth   shut .   he   was   so   over   his   paci   after   only   2   nights   and   now ,   he   and   the   monkey   are   inseparable   at   bed   time .
wonderful   pacifier   and   so   cute !   my   son   loves   his   wubbanubs   he   has   five   different   ones ,   the   monkey   being   the   first   one   we   got   for   him .   he   loves   these   so   much   and   i   love   the   fact   that   it   is   very   hard   to   lose   them   unlike   his   regular   pacifiers   which   are   always   rolling   under   the   furniture   or   are   just   hard   to   see   among   his   toys .   when   he   was   a   small   infant ,   these   were   the   only   pacifiers   he   could   keep   in   his   mouth ,   because   he   could   hold   the   stuffed   animal   part .   that   was   a   lifesaver   for   me   because   i   didn   t   have   to   constantly   give   him   back   his   pacifier   when   he   woke   up .   now   that   he   is   older ,   he   doesn   t   need   the   stuffed   animal   part   to   help   keep   it   in   his   mouth ,   but   he   loves   the   various   animals   he   has .   we   are   slowly   trying   to   wean   him   off   his   pacifiers ,   but   it   is   hard   to   refuse   him   his   wubbas   as   we   call   them   because   he   absolutely   beams   when   he   sees   them .   the   wubbanubs   are   very   easy   to   clean   and   they   have   been   very   durable .   i   highly   recommend   wubbanubs !
baby   hated   it   stella   hated   this   bear   and   screamed   at   it !   will   try   it   again   when   she   is   a   little   older , and   if   not   then   it   will   just   be   a   toy .
great   for   travel   i   bought   these   for   our   son   s   4   months   pacifiers   and   small   toys .   we   travel   alot   and   are   at   a   lot   of   outdoor   events   that   don   t   always   have   a   convenient   place   to   wash   dropped   items   off .   the   wipes   are   small   and   will   clean   a   binkie   or   a   small   toy   but   not   much   else .   they   do   leave   a   bit   of   an   after   taste   on   the   items .   the   package   fits   well   in   the   diaper   bag   and   has   a   great   closure   on   it   so   that   the   wipes   don   t   dry   out .   i   think   a   baby   wipe   would   probably   do   the   same   job   as   these   wipes   but   i   do   like   them ... not   sure   i   will   buy   another   pack   though
soothing   soothie   our   son   was   born   in   april   of   2010   and   loves   these   binkies   what   we   call   them   ... he   won   t   take   any   other   brand ,   trust   me   i   tried .   the   others   just   seem   to   gag   him .   i   breastfeed   him   and   we   don   t   have   any   issues   with   nipple   confusion   and   never   had   a   nursing   strike .   he   does   take   bottles   of   breastmilk   but   only   from   time   to   time .   these   are   the   binkies   the   hospitals   hand   out   when   you   give   birth   and   i   love   them .   ds   1   never   took   a   binkie   so   we   weren   t   sure   what   to   use   for   our   new   son   but   these   have   been   a   godsend   in   the   car   and   for   times   when   he   just   wants   to   be   cuddled   but   not   eat .
best   binky   this   is   the   only   pacifier   my   daughter   will   use .   i   specifically   like   that   they   are   an   orthodontic   nipple   and   bpa   free .   size   3   are   so   hard   to   find   in   the   local   stores   plus   it   s   cheaper   here   on   amazon .
took   a   chance ...   our   twin   boys   have   only   ever   used   mam   pacifiers .   they   love   them !   now   that   they   are   6   months   old   and   teething ,   i   needed   to   buy   the   next   size .   well ... i   received   the   pink   ladybug   set !   there   really   needs   to   be   a   gender   selection   available .
great   idea   .   .   .   the   idea   is   great ,   but   it   just   doesn   t   work .   the   sides   that   snap   closed   to   keep   the   pacifier   clean   dig   into   my   baby   s   cheeks .   it   doesn   t   always   close   before   it   hits   the   floor ,   either .   it   was   disappointing .
saved   my   life   i   love   this   product .   my   child   could   not   get   by   without   this .   this   perfect   for   breast   feeding   mothers .   it   also   allows   you   to   see   anything   inside   your   babies   mouth .
love   the   soothie   wubbanubs !   my   child   only   uses   soothie   pacifiers ,   and   i   found   the   wubbanubs ... and   my   baby   loves   it .   i   recommend   wubbanubs   to   all   babies .   they   usually   stay   in   place ,   better   than   the   pacifiers   itself .
josiah   loves   his   wubbie !   we   received   the   yellow   duck   wubbanub   as   a   shower   gift   and   i   never   even   took   it   out   of   the   box .   after   trying   different   pacifiers   that   left   marks   on   josiah   s   face ,   i   figured   i   d   try   the   wubbanub ,   because   it   was   the   same   pacifier   they   used   in   the   hospital .   br   josiah   is   8   weeks   old   and   he   loves   this   paci !   he   uses   it   at   naptime   and   bedtime ,   and   loves   to   hold   the   little   plushie   duck   as   he   goes   to   sleep ,   and   the   very   lightly   weighted   head   and   feet   of   the   duck   helps   hold   the   paci   in   place .   br   i   posted   pics   of   josiah   with   his   yellow   duck ,   so   you   can   see   how   easy   it   is   for   even   a   new   baby   to   hold .   br   after   receiving   the   duck   as   a   gift ,   i   then   purchased   the   red   dog   and   green   frog .   i   plan   on   buying   these   for   future   shower   gifts !
favorite   pacifier   i   bought   this   for   my   grandson   and   he   does   not   like   any   of   his   other   pacifiers   now .   it   is   great   because   it   doesn   t   fall   on   the   floor   as   rapidly   as   other   ones   and   he   can   hold   onto   it   like   a   favorite   stuffed   animal !   saw   it   on   the   today   show   and   had   to   have   one !   soo   cute   too .
awsome   love   them .   they   work   great .   only   problem   is   that   the   small   one   is   so   tiny   that   i   don   t   see   what   i   could   use   it   for ...
only   pacifier   i   will   buy !   these   are   the   best   pacifiers !   they   don   t   stick   to   the   baby   s   mouth   and   have   a   natural   movement   for   breastfed   babies !
great   shipping   was   fast .   haven   t   used   them   yet   but   i   ve   heard   they   are   what   the   hospital   gives   out   and   are   fantastic .
never   lose   the   nook   again !   with   the   wubbanub   we   never   lost   the   pacifier   again .   it   is   cute ,   durable ,   extremely   light   weight   and   we   received   loads   of   compliments .   would   have   been   great   and   cute   to   have   had   multiple   wubbanubs   stashed   around   the   house   and   diaper   bag !
my   preemie   baby   girl ! ! !   she   loves   these ,   only   type   that   she   can   suck   on   being   so   little   and   all ,   they   are   so   great   to   have   that   i   bought   more   for   her !   i   recommend   these   for   anyone ,   especially   if   you   have   a   preemie   baby !
great ,   as   usual   avent   pacifiers   are   great ,   last   long   enough   and   even   though   my   child   is   11   months   he   still   uses   0   3   months   size ,   as   recommended   by   my   pediatrician .   they   glow   in   the   dark ,   only   the   handle ,   and   are   easier   to   spot   in   the   crib   at   night
puppy   pacifier   looks   cuter   in   picture .   when   it   arrived   it   looks   kinda   cheap .   i   ll   post   another   review   after   the   baby   is   born   and   let   you   know   how   it   holds   up
godd   pacifier   but .....   wish   i   had   the   opportunity   to   choose   the   colours   i   got   as   ai   got   two   of   the   same   colours .
great   product   when   my   daughter   was   born   these   were   the   only   pacifiers   they   used   at   the   hospital   and   consequently   the   only   ones   she   will   use .   they   are   wonderful   and   she   loves   using   them .
larger   than   i   thought   after   reading   a   previous   post   i   bought   the   holder   thinking   it   would   only   carry   1   pacifier .   i   was   very   pleased   to   see   it   fits   2 !   see   costumer   images   i   am   using   newborn   size   and   i   have   no   clue   how   much   bigger   the   shields   are   on   size   2   and   3 ,   so   i   can   not   say   with   certainty   that   they   will   fit .   however ,   after   shaking   it   around ,   the   pacifiers   had   room   to   change   positions ,   so   i   hope   that   means   anything   a   bit   bigger   will   also   fit .   it   is   very   cute   and   seems   sturdy .   i   first   hit   it   against   my   hand ,   then   tried   it   against   the   table   and   desk   top .   all   3   times   the   container   has   stayed   shut .   it   gives   me   more   confidence   that   i   can   hook   it   on   my   diaper   bag   or   purse   with   it   surviving   the   day   intact   and   more   importantly ,   that   i   did   not   loose   a   pacifier !  
good   case ,   but   not   for   all   pacifiers .   this   case   is   very   convenient   and   durable .   the   only   issue   i   had   with   it   is   that   soothies   will   not   fit   into   it .   it   only   works   with   the   regular   shaped   pacifiers   like   mam   and   nuk ,   etc .   that   being   said ,   once   my   son   decided   he   didn   t   like   the   soothies   anymore   and   switched   to   the   mam   pacis ,   it   works   perfectly .
necessary   accessory   for   binky   babies   cute   and   practical !   i   m   able   to   fit   two   gumdrop   pacifiers   in   this   pouch   and   slip   it   into   my   diaper   bag   or   purse ,   it   s   very   handy .   i   love   that   it   s   anti   microbial   and   reusable ,   my   snack   sized   ziploc   bag   pacifier   storage   days   are   over ,   and   i   have   even   more   peace   of   mind   about   cleanliness .   i   haven   t   had   a   problem   with   the   pocket   detaching   or   falling   off   of   my   bag ,   i   use   a   skip   hop   diaper   bag   with   two   interior   key   hooks ,   and   i   attach   the   pacifier   pocket   to   one   of   those .   so   there   is   never   a   problem   with   detachment   or   locating   the   pocket ,   from   personal   experience .   i   can   also   maneuver   the   zipper   with   one   hand ,   which   is   always   nice   when   you   have   an   infant   in   your   arms .
baby   loves   his   gumdrops   my   firstborn   rejected   pacifiers   we   started   him   on   nuks   and   i   really   wanted   our   new   baby   to   have   a   way   to   self   soothe   in   the   event   that   i   can   t   nurse   him   at   a   moment   s   notice .   i   saw   some   great   reviews   for   gumdrop   pacifiers   and   decided   to   try   the   scented   version .   our   week   old   infant   has   taken   to   the   gumdrops   since   day   one ,   without   nipple   confusion   or   any   other   adverse   effects .   they   seem   to   comfort   him   immediately   when   i   can   t   nurse   him   right   away ,   and   are   the   right   size   for   his   little   newborn   mouth .   definitely   gives   me   a   few   moments   of   peace   knowing   that   he   s   comforted   in   someone   else   s   arms   while   i   prepare   to   feed   him ,   and   i   appreciate   the   fact   that   they   are   hospital   grade .
great   for   family   cloth !   i   bought   the   boy   pattern   of   this   a   few   months   ago   with   the   thought   of   using   it   for   our   family   cloth .   the   larger   one   is   perfectly   sized   for   next   to   the   toilet .   it   also   does   not   seems   to   absorb   the   smell ,   so   i   can   go   a   few   wash   cycles   for   before   the   bag   its   self   needs   to   be   washed .   br   i   also   bought   this   because   i   needed   a   nice   little   wet   bag   for   my   moon   cup .   the   smaller   bag   is   perfect   for   that .   br   i   love   this   bag   so   much   i   bought   a   second   one   for   my   other   bathroom !   br   just   keep   in   mind   that   the   patterns   pictured   on   the   bags   may   not   be   exactly   what   you   get .   br   with   both   the   boy   pattern   and   the   girl   pattern   of   this   i   received   the   bags   in   the   opposite   patterns   than   pictured .   br   also ,   the   only   reason   i   gave   this   4   stars   instead   of   5   is   because   i   did   notice   a   little   bit   of   fraying   and   a   couple   loose   threads   the   firs   time   i   washed ,   but   it   hasn   t   been   a   problem   since .
stays   in !   we   started   with   the   soothie   pacifiers   as   that   is   what   most   people   we   know   have   used   but   our   son   just   didn   t   like   them   much   and   had   a   hard   time   keeping   it   in   his   mouth .   then   we   discovered   that   we   had   some   of   the   nuk   classics   in   the   basket   on   the   top   of   a   diaper   cake   that   a   friend   had   made ,   so   we   cleaned   and   tried   that   and   he   loved   it !   while   out   of   town   we   wanted   an   additional   pacifier   and   i   picked   up   one   of   these   genius   pacifiers .   at   first   i   thought   that   the   plastic   was   cheap   because   it   felt   so   light ,   but   then   i   realized   that   the   lightness   factor   made   it   even   easier   for   him   to   keep   this   paci   in   his   mouth   gravity   was   less   likely   to   pull   it   out   .   since   it   falls   out   less   often ,   he   gets   upset   when   it   dissapears   less   often .   and   i   have   never   gotten   moisture   in   the   nipple ,   not   during   washing   or   in   the   steam   sterilizer .   great   pacifier !
amazing   we   have   a   preemie   and   this   toy   a   came   with   a   great   pacifier .   its   the   soothie   hospitals   use   and   her   small   mouth   can   latch   on   and   stay   on   b   is   smaller   than   we   thought   it   would   be   but   it   is   still   very   graspable .   c   we   ve   only   had   this   for   a   day   and   she   s   already   learned   how   to   grab   it   and   place   it   back   in   her   mouth .   this   is   a   must   have   for   preemies   and   newborns .
glows   if   you   expose   it   to   light !   great   paci !   people   keep   complaining   that   these   pacifiers   lose   their   glow   but   all   you   have   to   do   to   re   charge   it   is   set   it   by   a   source   of   light   light   bulb ,   night   light ,   etc   for   a   while   and   then   it   will   glow   again   good   as   new .   love   these   pacifiers   and   the   glow   in   the   dark   feature   is   genius .
perfect   i   think   this   pacifier   pod   is   perfect .   it   holds   two   pacifiers   and   i   had   no   issues   with   them   being   squished .   i   love   that   it   attaches   to   the   handle   of   my   diaper   bag   for   easy   access .   the   inside   of   the   pod   is   plastic ,   so   it   s   totally   water   proof .   it   also   is   a   great   way   to   keep   your   paci   s   clean   while   you   store   them .   i   also   love   the   cute   designs .   i   definitely   recommend   this   product .
good   but   great ,   but   not   the   exact   one   you   get   at   the   hospital   ,   the   hospital   ones   are   smaller ,   softer ,   and   have   a   space   cut   out   for   the   upper   lip   to   make   it   comfier .
great   for   preemie   my   little   guy   loves   this   pacifier .   he   s   just   learning   to   suck   and   gets   frustrated   when   his   paci   falls   out   and   this   helps   him   keep   it   in !   great   product !
love !   my   daughter   loves   her   wubba   nub !   this   is   the   best   purchase ,   and   totally   worth   every   penny !
defective   arrived   with   a   broken   zipper ,   thank   you   very   much ,   which   is   not   something   that   could   have   happened   during   shipping .   that   means   it   was   sent   out   even   though   it   obviously   defective .
so   cute !   looks   cute   and   its   what   i   wanted .   shipping   got   messed   up   and   took   some   time   to   get   here .   will   be   looking   at   getting   more   in   future .
great   for   tiny   mouths   my   daughter   had   the   tiniest   little   mouth   and   all   the   pacifiers   were   too   big   for   her ,   but   because   these   flex   so   much   they   were   easier   for   her   to   latch   on   to .   i   think   they   re   a   more   natural   fit   for   breast   fed   babies   too .
great   deal   wubbanubs   are   great . i   have   twins   who   love   them .   for   some   reason   this   kitten   one   is   about   half   the   price   of   all   the   others .   i   m   not   a   huge   cat   fan ,   but   i   m   glad   i   found   these   cheaper   wubbanubs .   i   was   skeptical   bc   they   are   so   much   cheaper   than   the   dog   and   frog   that   i   purchased   last   time ,   but   they   are   exactly   the   same .
love   these   binkies   these   are   the   perfect   fit   when   other   calming   methods   have   failed .   they   are   simple   and   effective .   my   husband   and   i   got   a   kick   out   of   them   because   the   nipples   are   hollow ,   so   you   can   see   into   your   baby   s   mouth   while   they   are   sucking  
i   love   this   gift ! ! !   this   is   a   cute   little   gift   that   can   be   used   as   a   gift   or   a   accessory   to   wrapping   a   gift .   adorable .   the   service   was   extremely   fast ,   as   well .   i   received   these   pacifiers   much   more   quickly   than   i   expected .   thanks   for   the   great   service   and   unique   product .
ok   pacifier   my   son   is   totally   addicted   to   his   sucker   and   had   no   problem   switching   to   this   in   addition   to   his   other   brands .   it   has   never   glowed   in   the   dark ,   though   which   is   why   i   only   gave   3   stars .   the   glow   in   the   dark   feature   is   the   main   reason   why   i   bought   this   brand .
love . love . love .   this   pacifier ! ! !   we   were   given   this   pacifier   in   the   hospital ,   and   it   is   the   only   one   that   my   little   girl   has   ever   had .   she   loves   it ,   and   so   do   i !   i   was   so   glad   when   i   found   them   to   order   since   we   were   only   given   1   at   the   hospital .   i   have   recommended   them   to   several   friends   who   have   used   them   and   love   them   as   well .   it   is   sturdy ,   yet   soft   and   comfortable   for   the   baby .   before   my   little   girl   was   born ,   i   had   bought   mam   pacifiers   since   that   is   what   my   first   daughter   used   until   she   started   sucking   her   thumb   ,   but   when   i   compared   the   gumdrop   to   the   mam ,   it   was   so   much   softer   without   that   plastic   shell   around   the   outside .   i   would   highly   recommend   this   pacifier   to   anyone   having   a   baby .   in   fact ,   i   think   this   will   be   my   new   shower   gift   for   all   moms ! !
adding   to   collection ...   i   bought   these   in   order   to   have   extras   besides   the   one   given   to   us   in   the   hospital .   i   also   wanted   ones   that   were   more   girl   since   the   one   in   the   hospital   was   teal .   this   is   the   pacifier   brand   recommended   me   by   my   pediatrician   luckily   it   works   with   my   daughter   because   it   did   not   for   my   son   he   never   took   any   pacifier   .
best   pacifier   ever   we   love   this   pacifier   it   is   wonderful   and   does   not   hit   baby   in   the   nose
cute .   i   like   this   because   it   is   colorful   and   cute .   i   sometimes   use   it   when   i   swaddle   my   daughter   but   it   doesn   t   stay   in   place   that   well .   i   thought   i   would   like   the   wubbanubs   because   she   could   hold   them   but   she   doesn   t   do   this   and   they   are   harder   to   hold   to   get   them   in   her   mouth   than   the   regular   soothies .   we   basically   use   the   regular   soothies   most   of   the   time .
best   replacement   for   human   pacifier   i   was   so   reluctant   to   have   my   babies   use   pacifiers ,   and   i   waited   until   well   after   i   had   established   breastfeeding   to   really   give   these   a   go .   but   now   that   we   use   these   just   to   help   them   go   to   sleep   ,   i   can   t   believe   we   waited   so   long .   we   initially   received   these   in   the   hospital ,   but   i   chose   not   to   use   them   for   a   while .   but   then   my   lactation   consultant   noted   that   the   gumdrop   soothie   nipple   is   definitely   fine   for   breastfed   babies ,   and   so   i   decided   to   try   to   use   them   in   place   of   me   when   they   needed   to   go   to   sleep ,   especially   during   the   day .   my   babies   were   sucking   just   for   comfort   all   the   time ,   and   while   some   of   that   is   good   and   good   for   your   milk   supply   ,   most   women   probably   can   t   spend   all   day   serving   as   a   human   pacifier .   enter   the   gumdrop .   my   babies   both   love   it .   if   they   are   tired ,   they   ll   go   to   sleep   immediately   after   the   gumdrop   goes   in   their   mouths .   these   pacifiers   rarely   fall   out   and   don   t   cover   up   their   cute   little   faces   like   the   soothies   do .   big ,   big   fan .
hard   to   clean   well   the   baby   liked   it   fine   but   it   is   difficult   to   get   clean .   water   stays   inside   the   nipple .   not   as   good   as   the   regular   nuk   which   costs   about   the   same   for   a   2   pack .
baby   loves   these   out   of   all   the   different   pacifiers   we   tried ,   theses   are   babys   favorites .   don   t   waste   your   money   on   others .
cardinal   paci   s   these   cardinal   paci   s   help   make   my   nephew   a   cardinal   fan   from   head   to   toe .   along   with   his   cardinal   outfit   ,   bucket   hat   and   blanket   he   is   a   true   fan .
sheep   thrills   i   just   received   baby   sheep   with   pacifier   and   little   girl   sheep   with   pink   bow .   both   are   absolutely   adorable .   i   love   the   serta   sheep   and   lambs   and   am   so   happy   to   find   a   place   that   sells   them .   i   thank   you ,   amazon   for   your   good   merchandise   and   fast   delivery .   toby   fox
must   have   overstocked   boys   pacis   i   also   purchased   this   because   of   the   neutral   color   shown .   i   got   race   cars   in   blue .   i   will   keep   them ,   because   they   can   be   used   at   bedtime .   as   for   the   product   i   love   mam   pacis .   quality   and   cute .   they   were   the   only   ones   my   daughter   would   take .
love   the   smell   baby   and   mother   loved   this   product .. worked   great .. just   remember   if   you   have   a   dog   he   will   love   the   smell   to   and   eat   it .
wubbanub   love   the   wubbanub   and   so   does   my   baby .   when   not   in   his   mouth   he   likes   to   hold   the   monkey .   i   am   planning   on   giving   one   to   my   pregnant   friend .
cute   pacifier   clip   i   get   many   compliments   on   this   pacifier   clip .   very   durable   and   it   does   its   purpose .
so   cute !   it   is   very   cute   but   i   don   t   like   the   fact   you   can   t   separate   the   pacifier   from   the   animal .   when   she   spits   up ,   it   of   course   gets   on   the   animal .   i   purchased   her   a   paci   plushie   and   i   much   prefer   that   because   you   can   use   any   pacifier   and   it   separates   so   you   can   wash   them   separately .   someone   said   they   put   the   wannanub   in   the   washer .   that   to   me   is   gross .   who   wants   to   wash   your   childs   paci   in   the   same   place   you   wash   your   dirty   socks !
great   pacifiers   our   child   isn   t   big   on   any   pacifier   but   he   s   taken   to   these   ones   the   best .   they   don   t   have   a   top   or   bottom   so   we   don   t   have   to   make   sure   it   s   in   correctly   which   is   nice   at   night .   they   also   come   with   plastic   covers   that   clip   right   on   so   when   it   s   in   the   diaper   bag   or   in   a   pocket   the   part   of   the   pacifier   our   son   sucks   on   doesn   t   get   dirty .
super   cute   i   just   got   this   paci   for   my   3   month   old   son   and   he   loves   it !   in   the   picture   shown   here   it   looks   like   the   wings   are   kind   of   a   purple   color ,   they   are   actually   a   really   bright   vibrant   blue ,   which   i   like   better ,   it   was   a   nice   little   surprise .
wubbanub   s   are   awesome !   when   we   would   put   my   son   down   for   naps   he   would   always   loose   his   pacifier .   with   the   wubbanub ,   it   rests   on   his   chest   and   he   doesn   t   loose   it .   now   that   he   is   5   months   old ,   if   he   looses   it ,   he   finds   it   again   and   puts   it   back   in   his   own   mouth .   love   it !
better   deals ...   i   spent   10   dollars   including   shipping   for   one   of   these   when   i   could   have   purchased   3   for   10 !   buyer   beware ,   babyhaven   is   aware   that   there   are   better   deals   and   when   i   brought   this   to   their   attention   they   ignored   me .   do   your   research ,   much   better   deals   elsewhere !
so   cute ,   but   can   t   replace   paci ! !   i   bought   one   of   these   for   our   little   guy   since   it   was   the   same   paci   he   had   used   at   the   hospital   and   it   looked   very   cute .   he   really   seemed   to   like   it   for   the   twelve   hours   we   had   it   before   my   dog   got   a   hold   of   the   paci   and   chewed   it   new   mom ,   still   learning   .   to   my   dismay ,   you   can   t   change   out   the   paci ... so   you   are   stuck .   basically ,   you   are   paying   for   one   really   expensive   albeit   cute   pacifier .   there   are   other   brands   out   there   that   allow   you   to   change   out   the   pacifier .   we   returned   this   excellent   customer   service   and   bought   a   paci   plushi   monkey   and   are   very   happy   with   it .
light   weight   cheap   paci   we   got   this   for   our   3mth   old   after   playing   replace   the   binky   way   to   much .   the   problem   is ,   it   s   very   light ,   and   the   pacifier   isn   t   as   good   as   the   advent   one   he   has   been   using .   basically ,   he   doesn   t   like   it ,   and   even   if   he   did ,   it   wouldn   t   stay   put   on   his   chest .
pointless   the   pacifier   themselves   are   just   fine .....   but   the   yankees   symbol   wore   off   after   only   2   days ......   save   your   money   and   don   t   bother ...
just   like   the   hospital   ones ,   only   pink   these   were   the   same   as   the   ones   the   hospital   issued ,   only   in   pink .   that   is   what   i   wanted ,   that   is   what   they   sent .   perfect .
great   paci   mi   son   loved   this   paci .   really   he   felt   in   love   the   minute   he   saw   it   pros   he   could   hold   hug   it   and   find   it   easy   cons   the   cleaning .   i   could   only   wash   them   by   hand   you   cannot   put   the   item   on   the   washing   machine   i   really   recommend   this   product
not   happy   with   these !   i   ordered   these   pacifiers   because   they   are   shown   here   as   being   neutral   in   color ,   but   i   recieved   blue   pacifiers   with   trucks   on   them !   and   i   have   a   girl ! ! !   its   ok   to   say   colors   may   vary   if   they   work   for   both   sexes ,   but   this   is   not   acceptable .   needless   to   say ,   they   are   going   back .
gotta   love   the   wubbanub !   my   three   month   old   son   loves   his   wubbanub !   he   holds   onto   the   stuffed   puppy   and   is   able   to   maneuver   the   pacifier   into   his   mouth   all   on   his   own ,   which   saves   me   from   washing   so   many   dropped   pacifiers .   the   stuffed   animals   are   all   really   cute ,   and   they   are   the   perfect   size   for   little   hands   to   pick   up   and   squeeze .   my   son   likes   to   hold   onto   his   wubba ,   pacifier   within   easy   reach   if   he   feels   like   sucking ,   while   he   swings   and   sleeps .   in   fact ,   now   that   we   have   one ,   i   am   not   sure   i   could   get   him   to   go   to   sleep   without   it !   i   would   recommend   this   to   anyone   with   a   little   one   that   likes   pacifiers .   love   it !
exactly   as   pictured ,   a   bit   on   the   expensive   side   after   shipping   no   complaints   really   about   the   product .   i   would   like   to   see   a   few   things   telling   me   how   safe   it   is   especially   since   the   skull   and   crossbones   glow   in   the   dark !   would   have   been   happier   if   cost   would   have   included   shipping .   10   was   a   bit   much   for   a   pacifier ,   but   it   was   exactly   what   i   wanted   so   i   can   t   complain   too   much !
choking   hazard   my   7   month   old   son   also   managed   to   put   the   entire   pacifier   in   his   mouth .   if   this   had   happened   during   the   night ,   he   would   have   suffocated .   please   do   not   give   this   pacifier   to   your   older   baby !   i   can   t   believe   that   these   are   on   the   market .   this   is   a   tragedy   waiting   to   happen .
good   for   traveling ...   we   use   these   when   we   are   on   the   go   and   we   face   the   inevitable   dropped   pacifier .   have   started   using   the   bogginhead   pacifier   clips   and   now   that   is   not   as   much   of   an   issue .
buy   these ! ! !   the   paci   given   at   the   hospital   was   the   only   one   our   son   would   take .   this   wubbanub   has   the   paci   just   like   the   hospitals .   it   s   just   heavy   enough   to   stay   in   place   so   you   aren   t   constantly   having   to   put   the   paci   back   in   your   infant   s   mouth .   then ,   when   your   baby   is   old   enough   they   can   hold   on   to   the   wubbanub   s   ears   or   paws   and   put   it   in   their   mouth   all   by   themselves .   great   for   them   to   carry   around   when   they   are   older   and   most   importantly   the   paci   is   big   enough   that   when   dropped   it   never   rolls   away   we   never   lost   one !   we   bought   three .   toss   in   washer .   it   s   a   perfect   shower   gift .
wubbanub   pacifier   i   ve   always   gotten   the   wubbanub   pacifiers   but   the   monkey   is   by   far   my   favorite .   the   weight   of   the   monkey   helps   keep   it   in   an   infants   mouth   and   when   they   get   older   they   can   find   them   easily   in   the   night .   super   great   product   and   prompt   delivery .
good   for   small   hands .   the   duck   is   very   cute   and   my   baby   likes   the   colors .   also   it   is   easy   for   her   to   grab   and   she   likes   to   feel   it .   i   like   that   the   wings   and   feet   are   weighted   so   that   it   stays   in   place   better .   the   only   down   side   is   that   it   is   cumbersome   when   she   is   upset   and   i   am   trying   to   get   her   to   take   her   pacifier .
the   only   one   i   too   purchased   other   pacifiers   and   this   is   the   only   one   that   my   son   will   take .   i   am   nursing   him   and   it   has   helped   with   his   need   for   additional   sucking   after   feeding .   none   of   my   other   children   would   take   pacifiers ,   but   i   bet   they   would   have   taken   this   one   had   i   tried   this   particular   brand .   it   is   the   best   pacifier   for   us .
wrong   colors   i   ordered   these   pacifiers   because   they   are   my   son   s   favorite ,   but   the   stores   don   t   care   them   any   more .   the   description   says   colors   may   vary   between   red ,   green ,   and   blue ,   but   we   got   pink   and   green .   i   m   all   about   boys   wearing   pink ,   but   the   pink   paci   is   a   little   much !   we   still   use   it   though !
wonderful   if   a   bit   heavy   i   bought   this   after   my   six   month   old   folded   his   regular   soothie   binky   in   half   and   shove   the   whole   thing   in   his   mouth .   scared   me   half   to   death .   i   didn   t   want   to   deny   him   the   only   binky   he   really   likes ,   but   i   also   didn   t   want   him   to   choke   to   death   in   his   crib .   so   i   got   this   one .   it   is   solid   enough   that   he   can   t   fold   it ,   and   he   loves   chewing   on   the   sides .   the   only   problem   we   have   is   that   for   the   first   month   we   had   it ,   it   was   too   heavy   for   him   to   keep   in   his   mouth .   eventually ,   he   did   get   the   hang   of   it ,   and   now   it   is   his   favorite .
nice   low   cost   wet   bag   i   use   disposables   when   i   go   out   with   the   baby ,   but   still   wanted   a   reusable   wet   bag   to   carry   baby   clothes   and   burp   cloths   that   get   dirty .   i   bought   these   kushies   bags   because   they   were   the   least   expensive   i   could   find .   don   t   expect   a   heavy   duty   wet   bag   at   this   price .   but   these   work   nicely   for   me .   the   drawstring   on   the   large   bag   is   held   closed   securely   by   a   plastic   grip .   i   ve   already   machine   washed   these   bags   a   few   times ,   and   they   came   out   perfect .   it   also   folds   up   very   small ,   and   takes   up   no   room ,   so   it   s   perfect   for   storing   in   a   smaller   changing   kit .   i   use   the   little   bag   for   pacifiers ,   because   i   don   t   like   them   rolling   around   loose   in   my   bag .   i   m   planning   to   get   a   second   set   in   a   different   color .
my   kid   prefers   the   soothies   i   bought   the   5   pack   being   optimistic   that   i   could   get   my   kid   to   switch ,   but   he   would   have   none   of   it .   they   seem   like   a   good   pacifier   but   i   think   maybe   the   wings   on   the   side   touching   his   cheeks   bothered   him .
my   baby   loves   it   ive   been   searching   for   these   pacifiers   in   stores ,   but   they   do   not   sell   them   anywhere .   thank   god   theres   amazon . com !   anyway   my   son   was   given   the   gumdrop   pacifier   when   he   was   first   born   in   the   hospital   and   he   loved   it .   we   lost   the   pacifier   and   bought   some   soothies   the   nipple   shape   is   the   same   as   a   soothie ,   but   the   soothie   is   too   round   and   bulky   and   his   mouth   doesnt   fit   on   the   pacifier   like   the   gumdrop .   it   takes   my   son   a   while   to   suck   on   the   soothies ,   but   with   the   gumdrop   once   its   in ,   he   loves   it .   the   shape   contours   the   mouth   and   makes   it   easier   to   suck ...   i   wish   they   sold   these   in   stores   so   we   didnt   have   to   pay   for   shipping !   i   highly   recommend   this   over   the   soothie !
the   only   pacifier   my   son   will   take   after   gerber   changed   their   latex   pacifiers   with   the   rounded   ends ,   i   went   through   literally   pacifier   after   pacifier   trying   to   find   one   my   son   would   take   so   i   could   get   some   sleep .   these   are   absolutely   the   only   ones   he   will   take .   the   only   bad   thing   about   them   is   they   are   very   expensive .   however ,   it   s   worth   it   to   get   a   good   night   s   sleep .
my   grandson   loves   his   wubbanub   monkey   my   grandson   cooper   is   never   without   his   monkey   pacifier .... he   is   3   months   old   but   hangs   on   to   his   monkey   pacifier .   it   is   so   adorable   and   useful   and   his   mom   loves   it   too   because   it   doesn   t   land   on   the   floor .
cute   stuffed   kitten   to   hold   on   while   sucking   on   a   paci   i   bought   this   wubbanub   as   we   have   cats   in   our   household .   for   now   my   baby   does   not   care   much   whether   the   stuffed   animal   is   a   cat   or   a   frog .   he   does   hold   it   while   sucking   on   the   pacifier .   however ,   my   little   boy   is   not   very   much   into   the   soothie   pacifiers   and   only   wished   for   these   to   work   with   other   pacifiers .
great   idea !   i   came   across   this   while   searching   for   a   pacifier   holder ,   but   thought   it   was   ingenious   that   they   would   attach   a   pacifier   to   a   stuffed   animal   for   the   baby   to   hold .   my   boy   s   only   6   weeks   old   and   hasn   t   really   gotten   a   grasp   of   holding   onto   things   yet ,   but   when   we   gave   it   to   him ,   he   seemed   to   really   like   it .   he   already   liked   the   soothie   pacifiers   so   it   wasn   t   a   big   deal .   i   think   as   he   gets   a   little   older ,   he   ll   be   able   to   hold   onto   the   puppy   better ,   but   we   think   it   was   good   for   him   to   get   a   headstart   and   start   holding   onto   it   now .   even   when   it   falls   out   of   his   mouth ,   i   like   the   fact   that   it   doesn   t   go   very   far .   sometimes   he   has   a   tendency   to   spit   out   his   pacifier   pretty   far !   my   only   dislike   is   that   you   can   t   detach   it   like   with   the   paci   plushies   so   you   could   wash   them   separately .
my   daughter   s   little   snuggly   friend !   great   in   helping   to   keep   her   ci   ci   in   her   mouth   with   just   a   little   weight   to   keep   it   from   falling   out .   it   helps   if   she   puts   her   arm   or   hand   behind   its   head   and   a   gentle   fall   out   of   her   mouth   is   quickly   recovered   but   it   doesn   t   survive   a   spit   out   or   quick   fall   out   still   great !   one   less   time   to   reach   over   to   put   it   in .   i   d   say   it   helped   to   keep   it   in   30   more   than   without .   it   also   is   great   for   her   to   snuggle   and   suck   to   soothe !   definitely   helps   that   soothies   are   one   of   her   favorites   too .   great !   soft !   comforting   in   more   ways   than   1 !
i   found   the   perfect   soothy   for   my   newborn   babygirl .   my   newborn   baby   girl   likes   it   too   much .   i   have   tried   some   other   soothies .   but   all   of   those   are   harder   compared   to   this   one .   this   pacifier   helps   soothing   a   child   to   sleep .
did   not   look   anything   like   the   picture   these   looked   totally   different   than   what   is   shown   on   picture ,   not   even   close .... different   color ,   different   shape ...
my   son   loves   his   wubbanub !   we   just   got   this   in   the   mail   this   past   weekend   and   my   son   loves   it !   at   2   1   2   months   he   is   able   to   place   the   paci   back   in   his   mouth   when   it   falls   out .   he   even   likes   to   chew   on   the   giraffes   ears   and   arms !   before   he   did   not   like   to   take   the   pacifier   and   would   only   keep   it   in   his   mouth   for   a   minute   or   two .   now   it   stays !
it   sucks !   there   s   no   way   this   can   hold   2   pacifiers .   it   s   beautiful   but   it   s   way   to   small .
smaller   than   other   but   great   for   car   seat   we   own   3   wubbanub ,   the   lion ,   the   monkey   and   the   giraffe .   the   lion   is   the   smallest   of   the   3   but   works   the   best   in   the   car   seat .   our   daughter   is   5months   old   and   can   easily   find   him   and   put   him   in   her   mouth .   also   makes   it   esy   for   us   to   find   when   driving .
lifesaver   for   us !   i   thought   many   times   whether   i   should   have   our   newborn   get   used   to   pacifiers   but   after   much   deliberation   and   research   i   went   for   it   and   purchased   these   gumdrop   pacis .   so   far   so   good .   our   4   week   old   baby   boy   loves   the   pacifier   and   definitely   helps   for   him   to   be   soothed .   br   because   it   is   not   one   of   those   orthodontic   paci   types   babies   will   not   be   too   dependent   on   it .
great   idea !   my   nephew   is   7   months   old   and   from   birth   he   used   the   soothie   pacifier   and   loved   it   so   when   he   started   teething ,   i   wanted   to   get   him   something   similiar   to   what   he   was   using   and   this   was   perfect ,   he   loves   to   put   things   in   his   mouth   and   the   texture   of   this   is   great ,   although   he   dosen   t   like   to   use   it   as   a   pacifier ,   the   nipple   is   different .
zipper   closure   is   a   must !   i   bought   a   different   brand   pacifier   pocket   first   and   it   did   not   zip   closed   and   i   was   always   loosing   pacifiers   and   they   were   getting   dirty   because   the   design   of   the   pocket   was   awful .   now   that   i   have   this   one   i   am   much   happier !   i   can   fit   two   pacifiers   in   it   and   zip   it   closed .   i   will   be   ordering   another   one   as   you   can   t   have   enough   of   these   for   clean   and   secure   pacifier   storage !
great   concept   but   poor   design .   the   part   that   closes   is   bulky   and   due   to   that ,   my   son   barely   gets   half   the   binky   in   his   mouth .   he   has   to   suck   really   hard   to   keep   it   in ,   which   not   only   leaves   a   red   mark   around   his   mouth   but   an   indent !   the   concept   is   great ,   i   just   wish   it   was   better   designed .   we   re   just   going   to   stick   to   regular   binkies   from   now   on .
baby   hates   these   i   bought   these   because   so   many   babies   love   them   but   my   son   hates   these .   not   to   mention   that   they   are   huge   on   his   little   face .
paci   stays   in   baby   s   mouth !   my   friend   told   me   about   this   product   when   i   was   complaining   about   jumping   up   every   30   seconds   to   stick   the   paci   back   in   my   daughter   s   mouth .   she   would   scream   bloody   murder   every   time   it   would   fall   out   when   she   was   going   to   sleep   .   this   has   been   a   life   saver !   this   product   would   be   better   if   the   stuffed   animal   could   detach   from   the   paci   though .   i   have   to   hold   the   stuffed   animal   with   tongs   so   i   can   boil   the   paci   to   sanitize   it .   also ,   i   have   to   move   the   wubbanub   away   from   my   daughter   once   she   falls   asleep   because   a   couple   times   the   stuffed   animal   part   ended   up   on   her   face .   it   s   a   great   product ,   but   you   have   to   be   careful   about   it   in   that   respect .
great   pacifier   i   ve   tried   many   with   this   similar   nipple   shape ,   and   this   one   has   worked   best   for   our   baby .   it   s   great   for   small   mouths ,   our   daughter   would   gag   on   many .   this   has   a   shorter   stem .   cleans   fine .   it   will   get   water   inside   but   it   squeezes   out .   i   have   bought   many .
large ,   bulky ,   and   heavy   this   product   is   really   large   takes   up   my   4   month   olds   whole   bottom   half   of   her   face   ,   really   bulky ,   and   really   heavy   which   makes   it   tough   for   her   to   hold   onto   or   keep   in   her   mouth   .   i   wouldn   t   recommend   it   for   early   teething   babies .   we   may   try   again   in   a   few   months .
love   it !   we   have   4   babies   and   by   them   having   their   own   animal ,   we   always   know   who   s   is   whos .
adorable   duck   purchased   this   as   a   gift   for   a   soon   to   be   mom   relative .   it   is   so   cute ,   i   m   sure   she   will   love   it .   arrived   in   very   good   time .
only   one   my   daughter   will   use !   my   daughter   refuses   to   eat   more   than   an   ounce   or   so   every   few   hours ,   even   when   she   was   starving   been   like   that   since   she   was   born ,   she   actually   refused   to   eat   the   first   72   hours .   guess   she   never   really   caught   onto   the   whole   sucking   thing   and   would   not   accept   any   type   of   pacifier   like   many   parents   we   bought   every   pacifier   on   the   market   .   that   was   until   a   friend   told   us   they   had   a   similar   dilema   and   bought   us   a   pack   to   try   out .   she   absolutely   loves   them !   they   are   perfect   hold   overs   for   until   she   really   wants   to   eat .   these   pacifiers   are   one   piece   and   without   the   plastic   guard .   the   advantage   to   this   is   that   it   reduces   the   chances   of   nasties   lurking   in   the   seams   cracks   of   where   the   plastic   joins   the   nipple   from   improper   washing   or   not   sterilizing .   unless   you   are   disassembling   your   childs   two   piece   pacifier   plastic   from   nipple   and   cleaning   it ,   you   re   not   cleaning   it   as   well   as   your   tell   yourself .   some   perhaps   your   child   shouldn   t   be   using   them .   these   are   newborn   pacifiers   as   stated   on   the   package .   if   your   child   is   not   a   newborn   then   it   s   probably   best   to   move   onto   other   pacifiers   more   appropriately   sized   for   your   child .   everyone   is   different   but   i   have   a   hard   time   believing   a   newborn   as   these   are   made   for   newborns   can   swallow   the   entire   pacifier .   i   ve   tried   and   had   trouble   myself .   other   complaints   about   the   lack   of   bulbing   at   the   tip   of   the   pacifier   which   makes   it   difficult   for   the   newborn   to   hold   in   it   s   mouth   is   nothing   more   than   laziness .   pay   your   child   more   attention .   if   your   child   is   sucking   her   thumb   or   mittens ,   sleeves ,   blankie ,   what   have   you   then   she   he   is   either   hungry   or   wants   comfort .   if   you   re   sticking   a   pacifier   in   a   newborns   mouth   just   so   you   don   t   have   to   listen   to   them   cry ,   it   s   probably   a   good   time   to   rethink   your   methods   of   raising   a   child .   a   pacifier   is   a   great   way   to   comfort   or   help   increase   her   appetite   we   used   these   to   increase   her   appetite   and   get   her   in   the   habit   of   sucking   so   she   would   eat   more   but   should   not   be   used   simply   as   adistraction   so   you   don   t   have   to   deal   with   them .   lastly ,   people   say   these   are   ugly   as   sin .   i   agree ,   but   your   child   doesn   t   care   just   like   all   the   decorations   or   excessive   amount   of   money   you   can   spend   on   newborn   clothing ,   your   child   does   not   care .   if   it   works ,   it   work .   every   child   is   different .   for   our   kid   that   had   trouble   grasping   the   sucking   motions   for   the   first   few   months   whether   it   was   breastfeeding   or   the   playtex   slow   flow   latex   wide   nipples   which   are   the   absolute   slowest   nipples   around !   ,   these   helped   her   become   strong   and   healthy !
this   is   my   new   must   have   item   for   babies   my   almost   2   month   old   loves   this   paci .   my   only   complaint   is   that   it   is   sewn   together   so   how   does   one   efficiently   clean   either   the   monkey   or   paci  
adorable   and   perfect   for   any   little   princess   i   purchased   this   pacifier   for   my   new   granddaughter   and   we   were   pleasantly   surprised   at   the   quality   and   cuteness .   it   feels   well   made   and   is   much   better   looking   in   person   then   in   the   photo .   i   will   most   likely   be   buying   more   so   we   always   have   one   on   hand   for   our   little   princess .
great   teether   pacifier ,   easy   to   clean !   these   are   great   pacifiers   because   they   don   t   roll   as   much   as   the   regular   soothies .   they   are   also   great   for   a   teething   baby   to   suck   on .   i   like   how   easy   they   are   to   clean ,   too .
soothie   is   a   choking   hazard   for   older   babies   this   pacifier   is   only   for   newborns .   my   son   is   7   months   and   also   stuck   the   whole   thing   in   his   mouth .   thank ,   goddess   i   happened   to   be   looking   at   him   when   it   happened   and   went   into   mommy   auto   pilot .

wubbanub   rocks   we   got   this   at   the   reccomendation   of   a   doctor   in   the   picu .   our   baby   boy   was   always   spitting   out   his   paci   on   accident ,   or   as   a   game .   the   wubbanub   is   the   best   thing   since   a   bouncy   seat .   the   toy   gives   him   something   to   hug   while   sucking   his   paci , and   the   added   weight   of   the   bear   helps   keeps   the   paci   in   his   mouth .   and   if   the   paci   drops   it   will   not   roll   under   furniture   never   good   to   have   a   screaming   baby   while   parents   are   on   hands   and   knees   surching   frantically   for   the   paci   .   i   am   thinking   about   getting   another   just   to   have   a   spare   on   hand   because   he   is   gonna   love   this   one   to   bits .
avent   pacifiers   our   daughter   loves   these   pacifiers ,   however ,   just   make   sure   when   purchasing   you   realize   amazon   chooses   the   color   for   you .   we   were   not   disappointed ,   we   received   2   purple   pacifiers .
so   cute   this   is   a   wonderful   and   fun   way   to   keep   track   of   your   baby   s   paci .   my   daughter   is   not   really   a   paci   baby   but   she   does   love   her   monkey .   it   also   makes   it   easy   for   little   ones   to   find   their   paci   while   in   the   crib .
baby   likes   it   better   than   other   pacifiers   my   baby   won   t   suck   on   pacifiers   much ,   mostly   just   chews   on   them .   but   he   will   occasionally   suck   on   this   one ,   and   when   chewing ,   enjoys   chewing   around   the   whole   thing   since   it   s   all   squishy .
clear   picture   i   bought   this   for   my   daughter   who   is   expecting   her   first   baby   in   3   weeks .   they   tested   it   out   and   they   are   pleasantly   surprised   at   how   clear   reception   and   picture   clairity   is .   i   felt   it   was   a   saftey   feature   as   their   master   is   on   the   1st   floor   and   the   baby   s   room   will   be   on   the   second .
cute ,   but   small .   these   are   some   of   the   softest   baby   garments   out   there .   the   only   downside   is   that   these   run   pretty   small .   my   7   week   old   is   fitting   the   3   6   month   size   pretty   well .   it   was   one   of   those   outfits   i   had   to   hurry   up   and   get   him   to   wear   before   he   outgrew   it .   great   construction ,   though ,   and   easy   to   dress   and   do   diaper   changes   with .
great ! ! !   i   had   not   actually   seen   the   frog   pod   w   toys   and   was   a   little   skeptical   by   the   pictures ,   description   and   the   price   seemed   a   little   high   for   bathtime   toys   since   i   was   ordering   several   gifts   for   our   2nd   grandson ,   thought   i   could   spend   the   more   practically .   however ,   my   daughter   in   law   had   actually   seen   registered   it   at   a   local   baby   boutique   so   when   i   found   the   frog   pod   on   amazon   for   more   than   25   off   our   local   price   i   ordered   it .   when   it   arrived ,   i   was   very   pleased ... the   quality ,   the   size ,   the   look   far   exceeded   my   expectations ... the   pictures   description   did   not   do   it   justice ... its   adorable ,   durable ,   practical   fun .   my   2yr   old   grandson   my   dtr   in   law   love   it !
cute   diaper   bag   this   diaper   bag   is   small   but   cute .   looks   like   it   will   fit   extra   clothes ,   a   couple   bottles ,   diapers ,   wipes   and   a   couple   of   pacifiers   with   room   left   over .   will   be   good   for   short   outings   with   baby .   comes   with   a   cute ,   color   coordinated   diaper   changer .   you   can   t   beat   the   price .   very   pleased   with   this   purchase   and   can   t   wait   to   use   it   when   my   baby   arrives !
great   for   treating   flat   head   syndrome   plagiocephaly   our   5   month   old   s   neurologist   recommended   to   use   a   sleep   positioner   to   help   him   sleep   on   the   less   favored   side   of   his   head ,   allowing   the   head   to   round   out .   we   have   tried   a   few   products ,   and   this   one   works   the   best   for   keeping   him   in   position   without   wiggling   out   of   the   positioner .   the   material   is   extremely   breathable ,   so   we   are   not   worried   about   overheating .   the   wedges   are   adjustable   with   velcro   and   stay   securely   in   position .   they   can   be   folded   inwards   to   change   the   angle   of   the   wedge   s   incline .   we   have   found   that   the   best   way   to   use   the   product   for   treating   his   head   shape   is   this   the   two   wedge   pieces   are   kind   of   pointy ,   so   we   fold   one   point   in   like   this   and   leave   the   other   in   vertical   position   like   this   .   we   set   the   baby   s   back   shoulder   not   head   on   the   folded   over   wedge   so   that   he   will   favor   the   round   side   of   the   back   of   the   head .   his   other   side   rests   just   inside   the   vertical   wedge   so   that   he   won   t   slide   out   of   the   positioner .   it   has   worked   quite   well   highly   recommended !
wonderful   pattern   for   a   girls   car   seat   i   pre   ordered   this   graco   snugride   car   seat   in   the   ally   pattern   2   months   ago ,   before   it   was   released .   i   fell   in   love   with   the   modern   look   of   the   gray   pink   contrasting   dot   design .   originally ,   it   was   to   be   released   at   the   end   of   january   2010   but   that   date   was   pushed   back   to   the   end   of   february .   this   caused   me   to   have   to   pay   more   for   faster   shipping   so   that   it   would   be   here   in   time   for   my   babies   arrival .   since   i   paid   extra   for   shipping   i   was   dissappointed   when   it   arrived   with   a   huge   gouge   in   the   box   which   was   taped   over ,   i   assume   by   fed   ex ,   the   shipper .   luckily   the   seat   and   base   within   the   box   were   not   damaged .   i   don   t   blame   amazon   for   these   problems   but   if   this   seat   had   been   available   to   purchase   in   a   store   near   me ,   i   would   have   preferred   to   purchase   it   in   person   and   avoid   the   problems   i   encountered   with   shipping .   the   seat   itself   looks   just   like   it   was   pictured .   the   only   thing   i   did   not   realize ,   is   that   the   shoulder   straps   adjust   in   the   back   of   the   seat   as   opposed   to   the   front   adjust   i   was   expecting .   after   experimenting   with   strapping   in   a   doll   i   borrowed   from   my   daughter ,   i   don   t   anticipate   having   any   huge   problems   with   this   design   feature .   in   fact ,   i   seemed   to   be   able   to   adjust   the   straps   tighter   and   with   greater   precision   than   i   remember   being   able   to   with   my   first   child   s   front   adjusting   infant   seat .   i   was   also   able   to   move   the   straps   from   one   shoulder   height   to   the   next   up   with   greater   ease   than   with   the   front   adjusting   model .   that   said ,   i   may   change   my   mind   once   a   crying   baby   is   occupying   the   seat .   overall ,   i   am   pleased   with   my   purchase   and   the   cute   pattern   of   this   seat   makes   the   shipping   problems   i   experienced   and   any   future   difficulties   i   may   have   with   the   back   adjusting   shoulder   straps   seem   worth   it .
worth   it !   we   just   ordered   this   crib   set   for   our   baby .   we   do   not   know   if   we   are   having   a   boy   or   a   girl   so   this   is   what   my   husband   and   i   agreed   on   for   an   either   gender !   for   the   price   we   are   very   pleased   with   this   purchase !   it   comes   in   a   nice   bag   and   the   ten   pieces   surprised   me !   the   bed   quilt   is   very   soft   and   feels   so   nice   after   we   washed   it !   i   really   love   this   set !
beautiful ,   but   falls   apart   this   piece   was   relatively   easy   to   put   together ,   and   it   looked   great   in   my   son   s   nursery .   however ,   after   a   year   or   so   of   diaper   changing   and   every   day   use ,   it   started   to   fall   apart .   the   drawers   were   flimsy   and   they   wouldn   t   stay   attached .   i   ended   up   throwing   it   away   after   a   year   and   a   half .
another   review   to   say   it   s   great   for   ferrets !   i   agree   with   every   other   positive   review ... my   husband   spent   a   lot   of   time   trying   to   jerry   rig   a   different   baby   gate   one   with   holes   in   it   with   clear   plastic   and   zip   ties ,   which   worked ,   but   then   we   moved   a   few   months   later   we   re   military   and   the   baby   gate   he   spent   so   much   time   on   didn   t   fit   in   our   new   place ... save   yourself   some   time   and   just   get   this   one ... one   of   my   ferrets   can   usually   figure   out   how   to   get   around   anything   anything ! ... sigh   ,   but   this   gate   is   impervious   to   his   ingenuity  
best   nursing   pads   i   ve   tried   i   ve   tried   lansinoh ,   johnson   johnson ,   and   playtex   pads .   i   wear   a   c   cup   and   have   a   very   heavy   milk   flow .   lansinohs   filled   up   much   too   fast ,   they   were   much   too   thin   for   me .   they   were   also   very   uncomfortable   when   they   started   filling   up   and   they   leaked   every   time   i   used   them .   the   johnson   johnson   worked   better ,   but   they   were   itchy   and   irritated   my   nipples .   playtex   are   my   absoloute   favorite ,   they   held   alot   of   milk   and   i   had   much   fewer   leaks !   they   are   highly   comfortable   and   i   would   reccomend   them .
loud ,   annoying   toy   the   title   says   it   all   with   no   volume   control   and   the   most   annoying   voice   used   to   sing   the   songs ,   this   toy   is   a   parent   s   bad   dream .   songs   are   sung   too   quickly   for   little   ears   to   understand ,   and   the   timbre   is   often   shrill .   avoid   this   toy   at   all   costs ,   and   please   don   t   give   this   to   others   as   ours   was   gifted   to   us   .   the   stars   are   given   only   because   my   kid   liked   to   look   at   the   brightly   colored   monkey .
great   for   me !   i   have   a   newborn   baby . this   diaper   pail   is   great   so   far   for   me ! i   never   smell   any   odor . i   love   the   foot   pedal
lots   of   features   for   a   reasonable   price   i   love   this   stroller .   it   can   be   used   from   day   1   as   the   seat   turns   into   a   flat   bassinet .   when   your   baby   grows   you   use   the   same   seat   for   them   to   sit .   i   ve   also   used   it   with   the   car   seat   from   mia   moda   which   fits   into   the   same   frame ,   replacing   the   regular   seat .   you   can   have   the   baby   facing   you   or   facing   forward ,   which   is   a   wonderful   feature .   the   adjustable   handle   makes   it   very   easy   for   my   6   6   husband   to   push   the   stroller .   the   basket   is   roomy ,   i   carry   my   groceries   in   it .   last   but   not   least ,   i   get   compliments   on   the   looks   of   this   stroller ,   everyone   thinks   it   s   one   of   the   expensive   european   strollers   .   the   one   drawback   was   figuring   out   the   folding   mechanism   the   first   time   i   used   it .   i   almost   returned   the   stroller   because   i   tried   opening   it   about   10   times   and   it   just   didn   t   work .   then   magically   i   figured   out   that   you   have   to   pull   on   the   tab   they   recommend   and   push   down   the   stroller   bar   with   my   hips ,   and   it   folds   very   easily .   do   not   give   up   the   stroller   is   totally   worth   it ,   especially   when   the   new   mia   moda   infant   car   seats   are   gonna   be   available   on   the   market   again   in   may   2010   the   old   ones   were   recalled   .   updated   16   months   later   while   i   still   love   this   stroller ,   my   son   who   is   99th   percentile   for   height   and   weight ,   is   quickly   outgrowing   this   stroller .   he   s   32   inches   tall   and   27   lbs .   his   head   is   getting   close   to   the   canopy .... i   may   only   have   a   few   months   left .   so   if   you   re   tall   parents ,   you   re   likely   to   have   a   tall   baby ,   and   in   the   long   run ,   the   kid   will   likely   outgrow   this   stroller   before   they   turn   2 .
don   t   be   fooled   i   purchased   this   humidifier   a   few   months   back .   the   first   month   was   perfect   even   the   light   on   the   front   and   the   trickling   noise   didn   t   bother   me .   i   wrote   a   great   review   and   posted   it .   br   about   one   month   into   owning   this   cute   humidifier   i   noticed   that   when   it   was   turned   to   full   blast ,   by   morning   there   was   water   puddled   underneath   it .   thank   goodness   i   had   set   it   inside   a   plastic   pan   or   my   wooden   table   would   be   ruined .   the   next   night   i   turned   the   humidifier   to   only   half   output   and   for   a   few   days   everything   was   great .   however   within   four   or   so   days   it   started   to   leak   even   then .   since   then   it   has   been   pretty   much   the   same   me   putting   it   at   a   smaller   output   and   finding   it   still   leaks .   br   do   not   let   this   product   fool   you .   i   did   months   of   research   and   was   suprised   to   find   this   particular   humidifier   with   the   best   reviews   and   at   such   an   affordable   price .   now   i   understand   why   it   was   so   cheap .
she   stays   in   her   toddler   bed   now ! ! !   this   ladybug   has   been   a   major   solution   for   us ! ! !   my   daughter   would   not   stay   in   her   toddler   bed   at   all   until   we   got   her   this .   bedtime   was   a   big   struggle   for   us   until   she   got   her   ladybug .   now   she   goes   to   bed   with   virtually   no   complaints ,   and   stays   in   her   toddler   bed !   i   also   love   that   the   light   is   dim   to   begin   with ,   and   then   goes   out   after   45   minutes   so   she   can   sleep   in   total   darkness   for   the   rest   of   the   night   better   for   health   and   development   .   i   would   highly   recommend   this   product !
very   quick   delivery ! !   very   nice   bassinet ,   would   definately   recommend   it .   i   had   to   call   the   company   and   their   customer   service   was   excellent .   they   told   me   it   would   ship   in   a   few   days   and   it   did .   very   happy   with   the   product   and   service .
fantastic   monitor !   we   have   twins   and   this   is   a   great   product .   you   can   set   the   sensitivity   of   the   device   to   turn   on   when   the   baby   makes   enough   noise   in   a   set   period   of   time .   as   a   result ,   you   dont   wake   up   for   the   small   normal   baby   sleeping   noises ,   but   you   do   when   they   need   your   attention .   i   found   it   plenty   loud   and   sensitive .   furthermore ,   because   it   only   broadcasts   when   the   baby   makes   noises ,   the   battery   can   last   for   days   without   recharge .   buying   another   for   my   brother   and   his   wife   right   now !
beautiful   crib ,   excellent   price   my   son   has   been   sleeping   in   this   crib   for   18   months   now .   i   love   it !   it   s   beautiful ,   and   it   s   still   as   sturdy   and   well   built   as   the   day   we   put   it   together .   i   also   love   that   it   includes   the   side   rail   to   convert   to   a   toddler   bed .   i   m   looking   forward   to   him   sleeping   in   this   bed   for   at   least   another   year   or   two .   i   only   have   one   complaint   the   side   pieces   aren   t   labeled   left   right .   the   directions   were   okay ,   but   it   would   be   a   huge   help   if   they   would   label   the   pieces   on   the   underside   so   you   know   which   one   goes   on   which   side .   at   first ,   i   put   the   side   rails   backward   and   scuffed   the   wood .   i   obsessed   about   those   scuffs   for   a   few   days ,   but   no   one   but   other   than   me   ever   noticed   them .   overall ,   this   is   a   fantastic   crib   at   an   even   better   price ,   and   i   would   definitely   buy   it   again .
snap ,   crackle ,   pop   this   monitor   has   the   worst   reception   i   have   ever   heard .   it   sounds   like   a   bowl   of   rice   krispies   on   my   night   stand   snap ,   crackle   and   pop   all   night   long .   my   parents   bought   it   for   me   as   a   birthday   gift   b   c   they   heard   it   was   the   best   brand .   but   we   have   tried   it   all   over   the   house   in   different   areas   of   the   house   and   cannot   find   a   place   without   interference .   i   ve   tried   it   at   my   in   laws   house   and   my   parents   house   hoping   the   problem   was   just   our   house .   but   it   was   even   worse   at   their   house .   and   the   hand   held   has   such   horrible   interference   that   we   could   not   hear   our   baby   screaming   over   it .   it   is   shocking   to   me   that   such   an   expensive   monitor   could   work   so   poorly .   i   think   it   is   a   giant   waste   of   money .
best   i   think   this   is   one   of   the   niceist   carseasts   out   there   and   the   color   is   gurgues
gotta   have   it ! ! !   we   bought   three   video   monitors   before   this   one   and   all   they   did   was   make   that   lovely   white   noise   fuzz   sound   because   they   clashed   with   our   wireless   music   system .   this   one   at   900mz   is   so   quiet   you   don   t   know   its   on   until   the   baby   makes   a   sound .   but   the   volume   doesn   t   go   down   very   quietly   and   then   its   just   silent   or   off .   so   we   did   put   a   little   tape   over   the   speaker   in   the   back   just   because   we   have   it   right   on   our   bedside   table   in   my   ear .   the   video   is   great   clarity   in   light   color   or   dark   black   and   white   rooms !   love   love   love   it !   also ,   there   is   a   a   and   b   channel   so   if   you   have   two   you   want   to   keep   track   of   you   can   switch   to   the   other   channel   after   purchasing   another   camera   of   course   .   overall   we   love   it   and   definitely   say   its   a   must   have !   i   also   like   that   the   video   can   be   turned   off   and   just   the   sound   left   on   if   you   keep   it   in   your   room   at   night .
mother   of   triplet   preemies   loves   these ! ! ! !   my   daughters   got   these   as   a   gift   from   my   sister   in   law .   when   they   were   born   they   were   all   over   5lbs   so   the   girls   spent   only   a   few   hours   in   the   nicu .   once   they   brought   them   to   our   room   i   asked   for   a   pacifier .   the   nurses   refused   so   i   sent   my   husband   home   for   these .   love   love   love   them ! ! ! !   the   girls   were   able   to   keep   them   in   their   mouth   without   us   having   to   help .   with   triplets   this   has   been   a   lifesaver .   our   morning   nurse   used   to   work   the   nicu   and   was   so   impressed   that   she   took   one   up   to   show   them .   not   only   does   it   sooth   them   but   our   friends   and   family   now   look   at   who   has   the   horse ,   kitty   or   dog   to   figure   out   which   triplet   they   are   holding .   love   them ! ! ! !
heavy   this   pacifier   weighs   a   lot   and   it   is   hard   for   my   son   to   keep   it   in   his   mouth .
pacifiers   this   is   the   only   pacifier   my   daughter   will   take .   it   is   a   life   saver .
overated   my   son   isn   t   really   into   pacifiers ,   but   my   husband   bought   these   hearing   all   the   rave   from   them   from   his   co   workers .   my   son   can   not   keep   these   in   his   mouth .   he   chooses   to   spit   them   out ,   and   prefers   the   cheaper   gerber   ones   or   sassy   mam   mini   trends   silicone   pacifier .   he   is   strictly   breastfed   for   the   last   4   months ,   and   still   would   rather   have   the   gerber   rather   than   these .   i   think   he   does   prefer   the   soothie   bottles   when   i   do   pump   and   will   be   doing   more   often   since   i   start   working   soon .   he   really   does   love   the   sassy   mam   mini   trends   silicone   pacifier   and   i   would   definitely   recomend   to   babies   that   can   not   latch   on   to   these .
wonderful   and   so   cute !   this   is   the   cutest   thing   to   keep   with   my   twin   girls   carseats   and   stroller !   the   paci   is   just   like   the   infant   soothie   paci   from   the   hospital   and   the   nipple   for   the   soothie   bottles .   my   girls   love   their   caterpillar   and   baby   doll   the   princess   one   .   this   one   has   great   textures   and   lots   of   colors !
not   what   i   expected   i   had   high   hopes   for   this   pacifier ,   as   we   have   2   dogs   and   3   cats   and   my   son   s   pacifiers   get   instantly   covered   in   hair   as   soon   as   he   drops   them .   even   on   a   pacifier   holder ,   they   would   fall   onto   his   clothes   or   blanket   pick   up   dust   and   hair   instantly .   so   to   say   i   was   excited   about   this   product   would   be   an   understatement .   here   is   what   i   wish   i   had   known   before   i   purchased   it   the   keep   it   kleen   pacifiers   do   not   automatically   close !   they   have   a   mechanism   that   keeps   the   cover   open ,   until   it   is   jarred   knocked ,   at   which   point   it   snaps   shut .   this   is   great   for   pacifiers   that   fall   on   a   hard   floor   from   a   substantial   height ,   but   when   it   just   gently   rolls   or   falls   from   my   son   s   mouth   when   he   is   in   his   car   seat   or   stroller ,   the   impact   is   not   enough   to   make   it   close ,   so   it   just   stays   open ,   lying   on   his   shirt   blanket   whatever   picking   up   hair .   also ,   as   other   reviewers   have   mentioned ,   it   does   not   have   very   good   air   flow ,   so   the   inside   of   the   pacifier   tends   to   fog   up   instantly   and   i   m   not   sure   this   is   very   hygienic .   in   summary ,   i   guess   that   a   pacifier   that   closes   some   of   the   times   it   is   dropped   is   better   than   one   that   never   closes   ie   a   regular   pacifier   ,   but   for   the   price ,   and   the   fact   that   it   doesn   t   work   in   both   large   and   small   drops ,   i   would   not   recommend   it .
convenient   for   diaper   bags   travel   these   wipes   are   nice   for   on   the   go ,   or   when   you   wont   be   near   a   sink   to   wash   off   pacifiers .   i   keep   them   in   the   diaper   bag ,   and   they   ve   definitely   come   in   handy .   i   also   use   them   to   wipe   down   her   play   tray   and   teething   toys .   since   they   are   a   little   on   the   expensive   side   for   daily   use ,   i   mostly   use   them   for   emergency   situations ,   or   in   the   car .   great   for   on   the   go !   good   product .
great   toy   i   love   it   for   my   daughter .   she   gets   to   cuddle   the   monkey   while   sucking   on   her   binkie .   it   also   helps   when   ever   it   drops   it   doesn   t   always   land   on   the   nipple   side   and   gets   dirty .
the   only   one   that   works   for   our   daughter   these   soothie   pacifiers   are   the   only   ones   our   daughter   likes .   she   loves   them .   they   help   her   fall   asleep   or   calm   down .   she   spits   out   the   avent   pacifiers .   you   can   attach   a   pacifier   keeper   clip   to   them   by   detaching   the   ring   that   comes   standard   with   the   mam   brand   and   just   threading   the   ribbon   velcro   through   one   of   the   holes   in   the   soothie .   at   one   point ,   she   preferred   these   pacifiers   over   the   breast   when   she   was   fussy   and   we   realized   that   she   had   nipple   confusion .   now   we   use   them   more   sparingly   only   when   she   s   surely   not   hungry   and   they   work   like   a   charm .
love   these !   these   pacifier   wipes   are   great .   we   initially   received   as   a   shower   gift   and   bought   more   when   we   ran   out .   they   are   great   for   cleaning   a   pacifier   that   was   either   dropped   on   the   ground ,   thrown   in   a   diaper   bag   with   other   stuff ,   etc .   the   smell   is   very   pleasant ,   not   harsh   or   alcohol   smelling ,   safe   for   baby   to   immediately   use   after   wiping .   highly   recommend !
very   satisfied   quick   shipment ,   item   as   described .   great   during   those   rough   teething   months .   my   daughter   never   took   a   paci   but   loved   chewing   on   this !
awesome   for   newborns   my   second   son   spent   some   time   in   the   nicu .   he   was   given   this   because   it   made   it   easier   to   keep   the   pacifer   in   his   mouth .   we   took   it   home ,   and   it   works   well .   i   doubt   we   ll   be   using   it   as   much   as   a   a   regular   pacifer ,   but   for   newborns   it   s   awesome
great   product   this   is   the   only   paci   my   daughter   would   use   in   the   1st   months .   very   easy   to   clean .   may   not   be   the   cutest   looking   but   does   a   great   job .
magic   my   breastfed   baby   resisted   taking   2   other   pacifiers   before   trying   this   one .   i   really   like   that   they   come   with   tops   which   makes   carrying   a   spare   super   easy !
full   term   is   one   and   the   same   as   newborn   full   term   is   one   and   the   same   as   newborn .   full   term   does   not   mean   this   pacifier   will   suit   an   8   month   old   infant .   full   term   means   a   newborn   baby   born   between   38   and   40   weeks .   that   being   said   they   come   in   sizes   preemie   and   neborn   full   term .   i   only   gave   this   pacifier   3   stars   because   i   tried   to   transter   my   newborn   twins   from   the   soothie   to   this   paci   and   they   wouldn   t   take   to   it .   they   are   nearly   5   months   old   now   and   i   managed   to   switch   one   to   a   nuk   but   the   other   still   likes   the   soothie .   however ,   it   constantly   falls   out   of   his   mouth .   so ,   i   pulled   this   one   out   again .   he   will   suck   on   it   but   now   that   he   is   bigger   it   is   simply   too   small .   in   fact ,   the   nipple   portion   is   smaller   than   the   soothie .   i   wish   they   made   one   a   little   bigger .   then   it   would   be   perfect .
the   smartest   thing   ever   i   am   sure   a   lot   of   parents   are   looking   for   a   way   to   make   the   pacifier   stay   in   place .   well   the   little   stuffed   animal   is   laying   on   your   babys   chest   and   stays   in   place .   i   am   very   happy   with   it ... less   running   back   and   forth   to   his   room   to   give   him   his   pacifier .
calms   my   3   week   old   my   son   had   a   heart   condition   when   he   was   born ,   so   when   he   was   released   from   the   nicu   he   had   to   go   to   the   cardiologists   where   he   had   many   tests   completed .   when   we   were   there ,   they   gave   him   a   vanilla   scented   soothie .   while   i   personally   hate   the   soothie   since   it   covers   up   their   entire   face ,   it   was   a   save   all !   he   was   so   angry   at   the   doctors ,   that   this   calmed   him   right   down .   by   the   end   of   his   visit   he   was   asleep .   when   i   researched   the   soothie ,   i   came   across   these   and   so   far   he   loves   them .   for   whatever   reason   he   favors   the   blue   over   the   orange ,   but   loves   them   both .   when   he   s   super   fussy ,   we   give   him   these   and   he   tends   to   calm   down   faster .   highly   recommend !
love   the   paci ,   purchase   elsewhere   this   pacifier   is   an   alternative   to   the   soothie ,   with   the   same   nipple ,   but   a   better   base   design .   i   love   the   product   because   my   baby   does   too .   i   received   ours   from   the   hospital   and   promptly   bought   more   from   the   actual   company   at   1.75   for   one ,   or   for   10.50   you   get   7 .   it   seems   to   be   a   lot   better   deal   to   me ...
wonderful !   my   baby   loves   hugging   the   lion   as   he   falls   asleep   and   stroking   the   soft   satin   mane .   he   is   used   to   the   soothie   pacifier ,   which   is   wonderful   for   breastfeeding   babies ,   the   way   they   suck   on   it   does   not   mess   up   how   they   suck   on   the   nipple ,   which   has   avoided   me   very   sore   nipples !
probably   great ,   if   your   child   already   like   a   soothie   pacifier   i   love   the   idea   of   this ,   and   it   should   work   since   the   weight   will   cause   the   baby   to   keep   the   pacifier   in   his   her   mouth   better ,   but   i   never   got   to   find   out .   my   daughter   was   picky   about   her   pacifiers   from   the   get   go   and   she   refused   to   take   this   soothie   one .
sturdy   paci   for   babies   this   is   a   nice   paci   for   babies   who   are   outgrowing   the   regular   soothie   pacifier .   it   is   pretty   big ,   but   made   out   of   the   same   materials   and   the   nipple   is   the   same   as   the   regular   soothies .   my   baby   sucked   on   it   more   than   he   chewed   on   it ,   but   at   least   he   wasn   t   able   to   shove   the   whole   thing   in   his   mouth   like   his   old   ones .
the   only   pacifier   my   son   would   take   my   son   was   a   little   fussy   for   the   first   2   1   2   months .   about   3   weeks   after   birth   i   tried   many   different   pacifiers .   the   soothie   wasn   t   my   first   choice   because   i   thought   it   looked   weird .   eventually   i   gave   in   and   bought   it   and   my   son   loved   it .   once   he   hit   3   months   he   no   longer   wanted   a   pacifier   and   he   is   a   happy   baby .   i   would   definitely   recommend   this   product .
my   son   loves   these   toy   and   pacifier   in   one .   easy   for   babies   to   hold .   my   son   doesn   t   even   like   a   pacifier   but   i   bought   these   before   i   knew   that .   he   still   uses   it   as   something   to   chew   on   and   it   keeps   him   satisfied   when   he   is   in   his   car   seat !
great   baby   monitor !   we   have   had   this   monitor   for   about   3   months   now .   we   love   it !   it   is   sensitive   to   pick   up   pretty   much   as   much   sound   as   you   d   like .   the   video   is   incredible .   even   in   a   completely   dark   room ,   we   can   see   our   little   one   clear .   i   m   not   sure   what   the   other   reviewers   are   speaking   about   when   they   re   describing   the   flashing   led   s .   we   don   t   see   any   of   this .   they   just   stay   on   with   a   very   dull   orange   appearance .   the   only   negative   if   you   can   say   that   about   the   monitor   is   if   you   use   the   video   a   lot   on   just   battery   power ,   it   drains   them   pretty   quickly .   you   need   to   use   the   video   on   off   button   to   take   quick   peeks   and   then   you   re   fine .   highly   recommend   this   monitor ! ! !
my   baby   love   it   we   bought   this   mobile   for   my   baby   that   is   2   months   old   and   he   loves   it .   the   movement   of   the   toys   is   not   round   so   he   has   to   do   an   effort   to   follow   his   favorite   toy   the   seahorse   .   he   could   spend   a   lot   of   time   just   seeing   the   movement   of   the   toys ,   i   recommend   it .
value   for   money   spacious   bag .   nice   vibrant   colours .   holds   everything !   diapers ,   formula ,   water ,   bottles ,   clothes ,   blankets ... not   appropriate   for   short   trips   unless   you   are   like   me   and   tend   to   over   prepare .   the   changing   pad   is   also   sufficiently   padded   and   comfortable .
has   worked   great   for   us .   we   bought   this   to   keep   a   distance   between   our   two   year   old   and   the   christmas   tree .   we   anchored   it   with   furniture   on   both   ends   and   it   has   served   its   purpose   well .   she   can   push   on   it   but   not   enough   to   be   a   problem .   i   m   thinking   of   using   it   on   the   deck   later   and   we   can   see   all   kinds   of   uses   for   it .
2009   model   strap   is   thinner   than   previous   years   this   is   my   second   britax   and   i   am   a   bit   disappointed .   the   best   part   that   i   liked   about   britax   was   solid   thick   strap .   my   other   britax   was   2004   onyx   and   it   is   still   going   strong .   the   strap   does   not   show   signs   of   aging   unlike   graco   s   or   evenflo   s   that   are   often   loosening   after   some   use .   for   2nd   kid ,   i   bought   this   expecting   same   quality .   however ,   it   lets   me   down   on   the   strap .   the   strap   is   thinner   than   previous   year   models   of   marathon .   is   it   designed   to   last   only   for   5   years   due   to   the   carseat   expiration   fiasco !   i   feel   my   child   is   less   secure   with   this   model .   i   hope   that   the   company   seriously   reconsiders   to   go   back   to   original   strap .
extend   the   life   of   your   trash   can   we   made   it   through   2   children   without   a   diaper   pail ,   and   our   3rd   child   was   20   months   before   we   tried   this   one .   so   we   ve   kind   of   made   it   through   that   heavy   usage   diaper   stages ,   but   i   can   still   see   how   this   would   be   a   real   plus   to   families   with   newborns .   we   always   used   scented   diaper   bags ,   and   just   tossed   them   in   the   regular   trash .   but   even   those   can   get   pretty   smelly   after   a   day   or   so .   this   arm   hammer   product   was   very   easy   to   use ,   came   with   good   instructions   and   supplies ,   and   is   a   pleasant   suprise .
so   so   the   seat   protector   looks   good   in   my   accura   mdx   with   grey   seats .   it   is   just   the   right   size   for   a   booster   seat   and   i   like   the   small   pockets .   i   wish   i   had   purchased   a   seat   protector   with   a   back   or   at   least   half   a   back   for   improved   protection .   the   storage   box   is   the   right   size   for   us ,   but   way   too   soft   and   flimsy .   we   quit   using   it .
great   purchase   this   is   a   great   car   seat   for   an   older   child .   easy   to   move   from   vehicle   to   vehicle .
nice   item ,   but   not   all   advertised   colors   are   available   rail   s   well   designed   to   fit   into   the   space ,   and   looks   sturdy ,   but   not   all   colors   mentioned   in   the   amazon   listing   are   available .   i   ordered   oak   but   was   sent   white .   it   took   a   few   calls   to   the   vendor   before   we   got   it   straightened   out ,   and   i   had   to   resort   to   an   under   mattress   rail .   somehow   the   first   operator   coded   my   return   as   customer   changed   mind   which   was   ludicrous ,   i   was   begging   them   to   find   one   in   my   color   in   their   warehouse   and   when   i   learned   that   meant   i   wouldn   t   get   free   shipping   back   on   the   return ,   i   called   back   again   and   the   second   operator   was   really   on   the   ball .   one   caveat   about   the   rail   if   your   child   moves   all   over   the   place   while   sleeping   and   presses   up   against   the   edge   of   the   crib ,   you   might   be   better   off   with   a   rail   that   blocks   the   center   of   the   bed .   that   s   what   i   ended   up   with   it   s   an   under   mattress   insert   with   a   9   inch   gap   at   top   and   bottom .   several   times   i   ve   found   my   3yo   partly   hanging   over   the   edge   at   the   gap ,   so   it   turned   out   to   be   for   the   best .
defective   on   arrival   unpacked   it   xmas   day   we   all   loved   it ,   it   charged ,   changed   colours ,   charged   and   now   wont   light   at   all .   we   have   tried   charging   again   and   left   it   charging   overnight   have   tried   every   position   for   charging   ,   pushing   the   bottom   buttons   etc .   going   back   today   ,   clearly   something   is   wrong .   very   disappointing .
crazy   leakage   problems ...   spotty   customer   service   we   used   medela   bottles   and   nursing   products   exclusively   when   our   daughter   was   born   6   months   ago   because   i   was   using   the   pump   n   style   and   had   purchased   all   medela   to   go   along   with   the   pump .   we   were   happy   until   a   mere   2   3   weeks   after   using   it .   a   few   bottles   began   leaking .   my   husband   and   i   tried   to   figure   out   what   we   could   be   doing   wrong ...   we   sterilized   according   to   package   instructions   using   the   medela   microwave   bags .   after   struggling   with   the   leaks   for   another   2   weeks   and   a   newborn   ,   we   called   medela .   the   rep   apologized   and   said   that   they   were   having   problems   with   the   old   plastic   collar   rings   that   screw   onto   the   bottles   with   the   nipples   and   would   gladly   ship   to   us   updated ,   newer   collars .   sure   enough ,   we   were   impressed   to   receive   them   in   the   mail   within   a   few   days .   did   they   solve   the   problem   not   really .   some   leaked   less .   but   others   sprung   new   leaks .   we   struggled   with   the   bottles   for   another   few   months .   we   had   invested   too   much   money   to   switch .   and   the   baby   liked   the   nipples .   by   4   months   of   use ,   practically   all   the   bottles   and   collars   were   leaking .   in   addition ,   we   had   3   medela   bottles   warp ...   yes ,   warp ...   in   the   microwave ,   again ,   using   medela   microwave   bags .   when   i   called   medela ,   i   spoke   to   a   rep   who   was   extremely   rude ...   told   us   it   was   probably   us   not   screwing   on   the   bottles   correctly .   when   i   explained   that   we   tried   everything   under   the   sun ,   she   told   us   that   before   giving   the   bottle   to   the   baby ,   to   check   that   the   caps   were   screwed   on   just   right   not   too   tight ,   not   too   loose   ,   to   twist   open   and   run   our   fingers   underneath ,   along   the   nipple   to   make   sure   everything   was   flat ,   check   that   the   threading   on   the   collar   lined   up   with   the   threading   on   the   bottle ...   etc .   not   only   were   we   already   doing   all   this ,   but   it   s   a   bottle .   who   has   time   to   spend   5   minutes   fiddling   with   a   bottle   with   a   hungry   baby   waiting   when   i   asked   if   she   could   send   any   replacement   parts   so   we   could   figure   out   what   was   going   on ,   she   finally   relented .   a   few   days   later ,   i   came   home   from   work   to   find   a   letter   stating   i   had   a   package   waiting   for   me   at   the   p . o .   when   i   finally   went   to   pick   it   up ,   was   told   i   had   to   pay   for   shipping   before   i   could   have   it .   it   was   shipped   c . o . d .   from   medela !   i   had   them   return   the   package .   went   home   and   threw   out   all   our   bottles .   we   are   using   playtex   bottles   happily   now .   no   more   leaks .   but ,   unfortunately ,   we   had   already   spent   a   lot   of   money   on   medela   bottles   and   products .   as   an   ob   physician ,   i   no   longer   recommend   medela   products   exclusively   to   my   patients .   they   have   good   pumps ,   but   their   other   products   are   overpriced ,   in   my   opinion ,   and   not   necessarily   high   in   quality .
not   as   pictured   appliques   are   plain   no   designs   spent   a   little   extra   on   this   set   because   the   numbers   and   letters   are   supposed   to   have   little   designs   on   them   as   pictured   .   what   got   sent   to   me   were   plain   ones   with   no   designs .   i   was   disappointed .
absolutely   beautiful !   my   1   year   old   received   this   as   a   christmas   gift   today   and   i   was   so   pleased   with   it .   he   already   had   a   melissa   doug   stacker   that   i   was   about   to   throw   away   because   the   paint   was   chipping   badly   and   they   had   a   product   recall   on   a   similar   item .   this   stacker   is   finished   in   such   a   way   that   it   seems   the   paint   would   not   easily   chip   and   even   if   it   did   since   it   is   vegetable   dye ,   no   worries .   i   love   the   muted   yet   rich   and   warm   colors   in   this   toy   and   my   son   likes   to   play   with   it   as   much   as   the   other   stacker .   it   is   a   little   shorter   with   less   pieces   than   the   other   one ,   but   for   a   1   year   old   i   actually   prefer   that .   i   will   definitely   be   purchasing   more   items   from   this   company !
good ,   but   sticks   together   these   wipes   are   nice   because   they   are   natural   and   perfect   for   baby   s   sensitive   skin .   they   worked   just   as   well   as   7th   generation   wipes   when   my   son   had   a   horrible   diaper   rash .   no   screaming ! !   the   only   complaint   i   have   it   that   they   stick   together .   it   is   hard   to   get   only   one   out   of   the   package   when   you   have   the   other   hand   holding   the   baby .   this   isn   t   a   huge   problem ,   but   worth   mentioning .   also ,   the   orange   essential   oil   smell   is   a   bit   strong ,   but   subsides   when   they   are   stored   in   a   wipes   warmer .   also ,   not   a   huge   problem ,   nor   do   they   smell   bad ,   just   somewhat   strong .
light   up   toy   this   toy   is   fun .   the   cord   is   a   liitle   hard   to   pull ,   but   it   is   fun   for   my   grandson .
great   baby   rattle   this   was   a   big   hit ,   it   s   very   soft   and   clutch   able ,   even   for   tiny   hands   ...   and   big   sister   like   to   rattle   it   too !
cute   cute   set   but   the   handles   are   overly   heavy .   they   always   tip   small   containers   yogurt ,   applesauce ,   etc .   over   when   my   daughter   leaves   her   spoon   inside .
great   product ,   love   it   these   work   very   well ,   so   much   easier   for   us   to   use   than   the   typical   difficult   to   remove   snap   in   protectors ,   and   stylish ,   too .
best   all   around   sppon   i   ve   used   these   spoons   with   my   son   from   4mo   until   now   15mo   .   they   ve   held   up   perfectly   in   the   dishwasher   inside   a   munchkin   dishwasher   basket   on   the   top   shelf   .   the   long   length   is   good   for   mommy   maintaining   a   good   hold   on   the   spoon   while   your   infant   flails   his   arms   around !   the   only   downside   is   that   the   spoons   aren   t   the   best   for   the   infant   learning   to   spoon   feed   himself .   the   bowl   of   the   spoon   is   too   little   and   slippery   and   the   length   is   too   long   bad   angle   for   short   arms   .   i   can   see   where   the   long   length   would   cause   the   spoon   to   tip   out   of   the   baby   food   container   but   with   the   ledge   on   the   handle   i   never   personally   had   this   problem .   in   summary ,   i   d   definitely   buy   them   again   esp   for   infants   under   15mo   and   have   bought   them   for   several   friends   as   shower   presents .   i   like   these   munchkin   spoons   much   better   than   the   temperature   sensitive   spoons   with   the   metal   handles   1   i   didnt   need   the   temp   sensitive   part   because   i   rarely   warmed   up   the   food   didn   t   want   him   to   get   used   to   always   having   warm   food   .   2   the   temp   sensitive   part   seems   like   a   good   idea   but   didnt   really   work   as   the   food   always   covered   the   bit   that   tells   you   if   it   s   too   hot   and   it   s   too   much   of   a   pain   to   wipe   it   off .   3   the   metal   on   the   spoons   rusts   in   the   dishwasher   and   4   the   metal   handles   definitely   cannot   be   grasped   by   an   infant   too   skinny   and   awkward   for   a   full   palm   grasp   .
cute !   this   is   really   a   cute   set   that   goes   with   all   the   other   kitchen   littles   appliances .   nice   and   durable !   makes   a   nice   addiction   to   the   other   kitchen   little   sets .
big   hit   with   our   girls   this   is   an   awesome   rocking   horse   that   we   hope   to   have   for   many   years   to   come !   our   girls   love   it   and   it   was   very   easy   to   put   together .   the   cognac   color   is   also   a   very   nice   stain !   great   price   and   we   felt   like   we   got   a   great   deal !
super   soft   this   sheet   is   exactly   what   i   was   hoping   for   something   soft   for   my   baby   boy   and   that   fit   generously   and   tailored   to   the   crib   mattress .   i   had   purchased   other   fitted   sheets   that   were   similar ,   but   because   they   seemed   to   shrink   after   washing ,   their   fit   was   compromised   no   good .   i   strongly   recommend   this   product   as   the   quality   is   excellent   and   just   how   it   should   be   i   will   definitely   purchase   more   sheets   from   this   company   in   the   future .
good   customer   service ,   lousy   product   i   m   on   my   second   tots   in   mind   crib   tent .   the   company   mailed   us   a   replacement   without   any   fuss   after   the   netting   separated   from   the   nylon   material   and   the   zipper   fell   off .   the   nylon   shredded   when   i   attempted   to   sew   it   together   myself   the   fabric   simply   won   t   allow   for   patching .   the   replacement ,   unfortunately ,   ripped   in   the   same   manner   as   the   original   while   my   husband   was   installing   it .   cotton   combined   with   mesh   would   be   a   better   choice   than   nylon .   though   i   appreciate   the   good   customer   service   from   tots   in   mind ,   i   hope   another   manufacturer   comes   along   with   a   better   product .
leaky   and   shoddily   made   i   m   shocked   other   reviewers   thought   this   was   a   great   cup .   they   are   so   shoddily   constructed   that   when   mine   arrived   on   one   cup   the   thingy   you   flip   to   cover   the   straw   had   already   popped   off ,   despite   being   in   pretty   sturdy   packaging .   it   was   difficult   to   put   back   on .   the   flip   top   is   very   difficult   to   flip   back   and   forth   my   15mo   couldn   t   do   it ,   while   he   can   easily   open   and   close   the   playtex   ones .   the   worst   part   was   that   these   cups   leak .   a   lot .   my   son   throws   his   cup   off   the   highchair   when   i   m   not   looking .   the   playtex   ones   never   leak .   these   leak   most   of   the   contents   immediately   from   where   the   cap   screws   on   to   the   bottom .   i   just   threw   them   out   i   d   rather   count   the   spent   on   them   wasted   than   be   forever   cleaning   up   milk   off   the   floor .
great   bottle   rack   high   capacity !   i   ve   had   this   rack   since   our   daughter   s   birth   in   february   2009 .   we   have   the   dr .   brown   s   bottles   with   all   their   attendant   pieces   which   are   really   annoying   to   wash   over   and   over   again ,   but   that   s   a   different   issue !   ,   and   have   gone   through   the   4   oz .   size   and   now   use   the   8   oz   size .   in   both   cases   we   have   had   around   8   bottles   active   at   any   one   time   and   this   rack   is   truly   awesome   in   its   capability   to   hold   all   the   parts   for   that   many   bottles ,   due   to   its   2   tiers .   if   we   didn   t   have   the   tube   like   inserts   which   go   inside   the   bottle   to   de   bubble   the   milk   formula   ,   it   could   hold   more   bottles ,   but   we   use   the   top   tier   tines   to   hold   those   inserts ,   and   it   s   perfect .   the   bottles   mostly   go   on   the   bottom   rack   tines ,   and   all   the   other   parts   caps ,   nipples ,   etc .   go   in   the   middle .   other   things   like   pacifiers ,   etc .   can   go   there ,   too .   yes ,   the   tines   can   come   out   pretty   easily   but   in   everyday   use   this   has   only   happened   a   few   times   to   me .   and   no ,   this   is   not   a   good   rack   for   glass   bottles .   all   in   all ,   an   awesome   rack   which   appears   to   have   much   larger   capacity   than   others ,   while   still   being   relatively   space   saving   due   to   the   2   tier   design .
great   toy   for   baby   based   on   the   reviews ,   we   bought   this   toy   before   our   daughter   was   born .   from   1   3   months ,   she   didn   t   have   much   use   for   it .   but ,   for   the   last   four   months ,   she   has   really   enjoyed   this   toy   giraffe .   it   is   a   small ,   convenient   toy   that   she   can   gnaw   on   and   play   while   on   the   go .   also ,   i   like   the   fact   that   it   is   made   of   natural   materials .   highly   recommended !
love   it !   this   is   a   wonderfully   soft   and   warm   receiving   blanket .   my   favorite   thing   about   it   is   the   size .   it   is   much   larger   than   the   other   receiving   blankets   i   ve   used .   it   is   easier   to   wrap   the   baby   up   snuggly   and   he   stays   wrapped   up .   we   ve   used   swaddle   designs   for   both   of   our   kids ,   i   highly   recommend   them !
helpful   but   be   careful   this   bottle   warmer   definitely   is   useful   it   does   what   you   want   it   to   do .   however ,   always   make   sure   you   test   the   temperature   of   the   milk   before   you   give   it   to   your   baby   as   it   can   be   to   hot   or   too   cool   sometimes .   this   is   because   there   are   many   variables   that   affect   the   ending   temperature   the   starting   temperature   of   the   milk   from   the   referigerator ,   freezer ,   room   temperature   etc .   the   type   of   bottle   i . e . ,   glass ,   plastic ,   etc .   ,   bottle   size   diameter   as   well   as   height   amount   of   water   you   put   in   here   as   a   corollary ,   be   careful   with   the   condensation   off   the   bottle   as   that   can   also   be   quite   hot .   as   far   as   functionality   is   concerned ,   it   does   what   you   want ,   but   of   course   effectiveness   is   based   on   the   variables   i   mentioned   for   temeprature .   the   only   part   i   wish   this   had   that   some   other   manufacturers   build   into   the   model   is   an   ability   to   use   the   steam   to   steralize   baby   paraphenalia ,   such   as   pacifiers .
love   wubbanubs   i   love ,   love   love   these   wubbanubs .   not   only   are   the   super   cute ,   but   they   work   pretty   good   at   helping   baby   keep   pacifier   in   mouth ,   plus   it   also   gives   baby   a   soft   texture   to   explore .
doll   crib   assembly   was   more   intense ,   but   using   wood   glue   to   secure   product   made   the   crib   more   stable .   the   material   for   lining   was   pretty   thin   as   was   the   cover   and   pillow .   overall ,   the   size   is   great   and   fits   most   any   standard   babydoll .   the   little   storage   boxes   made   my   grandaughter   very   happy .   the   mobile   is   very   sturdy .   this   should   last   for   a   long   time   by   enforcing   everything   with   the   woodglue .   cute   in   her   room   too .
son   loves   it !   this   satineesnug   bear   was   a   gift   my   son   received   at   the   hospital   when   he   was   born .   now ,   at   1.5   years   old ,   he   sleeps   with   every   night .   the   first   thing   he   does   when   i   put   him   down   in   his   crib   is   snuggle   it   up   to   his   chest .   it   s   gone   through   numerous   washings   has   held   up   perfectly .   i   m   buying   another   one   so   i   can   switch   them   out   when   one   is   being   washed .   i   d   recommend   this   to   anyone   looking   for   a   sweet   gift   for   the   new   baby .
life   saver   my   baby   was   given   this   type   of   pacifier   at   northside   hospital   in   atlanta   and   it   is   the   only   one   he   will   take .   they   aren   t   sold   in   many   stores   so   finding   them   on   amazon   was   great .   if   you   can   keep   up   with   these   pacifiers   they   ll   last   for   a   long   time   the   material   doesn   t   break   down   like   the   more   common   brands   and   the   outter   portion   is   great   for   teething .   i   highly   recommend   this   pacifier   but   make   sure   you   don   t   order   the   preemie   newborn   kind ...   they   are   way   too   small .
great   for   teething   my   breast   fed ,   finger   sucking   infant   has   no   interest   in   conventional   pacifiers .   he   likes   the   natursutten   pacifiers   because   they   re   easy   to   hold   and   great   fun   to   chew   on .   he   can   easily   put   this   pacifier   in   his   own   mouth   and   take   it   out   as   he   pleases .   he   doesn   t   use   the   pacifier   much   for   sucking ,   as   he   still   prefers   his   fingers ,   but   loves   to   chew   on   all   parts   of   it .   i   have   found   it   to   be   easy   to   clean   and   maintain   i   oil   it   with   extra   virgin   olive   oil   after   washing   it   so   that   it   looks   like   new   .   a   little   pricey   but   worth   it   for   me .
not   safe   keep   it   kleen   i   thought   this   product   would   be   great   for   my   14   month   old   when   i   saw   another   mom   had   it ,   so   i   went   out   and   bougght   5   of   them   with   high   hopes .   br   br   however ,   within   3   hours   my   son   got   injured   in   his   lip   when   he   fell   with   the   keep   it   kleen   pacifier   and   began   to   bleed   rapidly   with   a   pool   of   blood   beside   him .   it   was   very   scary ! ! !   i   almosty   went   to   the   emergency   room ,   but   managed   to   get   the   blleding   to   stop   after   ten   minutes   or   so ...   br   br   your   child   will   likely   fall   down   and   some   point   while   walking ,   etc .   and   if   they   have   the   pacifier   in   their   mouth   it   may   cause   some   extensive   damage   to   the   upper ,   lower   lip   internally   or   externally .   br   br   i   contacted   the   company   and   they   were   suppose   to   send   me   some   information   in   the   mail   and   to   no   avail   have   i   received   anything   from   them .   br   br   not   impressed   with   the   level   of   concern   and   curious   how   many   other   children   will   be   injured   and   tramatized   from   this ...   br   br   regards ,   br   concerned   mom

such   a   cute   idea   my   kids   love   wagons   and   they   love   blocks ,   so   i   thought   this   would   be   the   perfect   toy   for   them .   ideally   i   should   have   bought   them   separately .   the   blocks   are   a   lot   of   fun ,   but   the   wagon   is   a   little   awkward .   the   cord   is   very   short   to   keep   kids   from   strangulation   i   m   guessing   so   it   s   hard   to   pull .   with   the   wheels   it   s   also   hard   to   store   this   on   the   shelf   with   their   other   toys ,   so   if   i   were   to   do   it   again   i   would   go   with   a   wooden   block   set   and   then   buy   a   better   designed   wagon   separately .   overall   it   s   great   for   the   price ,   just   frustrating   at   times   for   my   kids .   i   have   noticed   the   paint   flecking   off   on   a   few   of   the   corners ,   so   not   a   good   idea   to   let   little   ones   put   them   in   their   mouths .

4   and   3   4   stars !   the   4   3   4   i   bought   this   car   seat ,   like   many   other   people ,   because   it   is   top   of   the   line   here   in   the   states .   i   am   a   very   frugal   person ,   so   dropping   200   something   on   a   car   seat   is   very   uncharacteristic   of   me .   however ,   there   are   things   you   skimp   on   hand   me   down   clothes ,   second   had   toys ,   etc .   the   safety   of   my   child   just   wasn   t   one   of   those   things .   this   car   seat   is   miles   ahead   of   the   infant   carrier   car   seat   we   had   when   my   daughter   was   first   born .   being   frugal ,   before   my   daughter   was   born ,   i   bought   infant   carrier   car   seat   because   it   came   with   a   stroller   it   connected   with .   my   daughter   out   grew   the   weight   height   requirement   by   the   time   she   turned   10   months   old .   for   what   i   spent   on   that   car   seat ,   vs   what   i   spend   on   the   britax   and   how   long   it   will   last   her ,   i   feel   like   i   got   ripped   off   on   the   earlier   car   seat .   not   only   did   she   out   grow   it   quickly ,   but   it   was   complicated   to   snap   her   in ,   and   although   i   had   it   latched   down   and   had   the   seat   belt   through   it   and   ratcheted   tight ,   it   still   moved   when   i   went   over   bumps .   going   from   that   to   our   now   installed   britax   was   night   and   day .   it   is   so   easy   to   get   her   in   and   out   of   this ,   there   are   even   little   velcro   patches   on   the   sides   that   you   can   stick   the   straps   to   to   get   her   in   and   out   easier .   the   clicking   system   is   great   for   knowing   when   it   s   just   snug   enough ,   i   find   that   it   takes   between   2   3   clicks   to   have   it   snug   enough ,   but   it   s   reassuring   to   hear   the   clicks   it   s   also   great   for   her   grandparents   .   my   daughter   is   still   rear   facing   and   i   really   like   that   it   has   a   rebound   strap   that   connects   to   the   floor .   i   also   like   that   she   will   be   able   to   remain   rear   facing   until   she   is   35   pounds ,   all   the   safer   for   her .   i   don   t   think   i   will   ever   buy   anything   but   britax   again .   the   1   4   star   left   off   note   i   don   t   list   expenses   as   a   con ,   because   i   feel   like   i   have   gotten   what   i   paid   for   1 .   it   was   difficult   to   install   in   the   rear   facing   position .   we   had   a   car   seat   check   done   i   would   highly   recommend   this ,   these   people   put   in   a   lot   of   hours   to   learn   how   to   keep   our   kids   strapped   in   safe   and   properly ,   and   their   services   are   free !   it   s   worth   30   minutes   out   of   your   saturday   ,   and   we   had   done   it   mostly   right ,   but   even   the   car   seat   tech   had   a   bit   hard   time   getting   it   into   just   the   right   position   she   also   raved   about   the   britax   car   seat   and   told   us   advantages   about   it   we   were   unaware   of   .   2 .   the   seat   although   it   doesn   t   move   a   smidgen   left   to   right   love   that   actually   slips   down   towards   the   back   of   the   seat   of   the   car   making   my   daughter   more   reclined   back   i   hope   that   made   sense   .   i   think   this   is   because   of   the   angle   of   our   leather   seats .   kind   of   annoying ,   but   quick   and   easy   to   scooch   it   back   into   place .   3 .   this   thing   is   big .   and   takes   up   a   lot   of   room .   i   can   t   see   this   fitting   in   a   smaller   car   rear   facing .   it   just   barely   fits   rear   facing   in   our   sequoia   in   the   center   spot   i   know   it   wouldn   t   fit   behind   the   seats   with   them   pushed   all   the   way   back   my   hubby   and   i   are   both   6   ft   ,   so   that   s   a   bit   of   a   downer   if   we   had   to   have   her   on   the   side   . for   that   reason ,   and   the   difficulty   of   installing   it   rear   facing   initially   i   think   i   could   do   it   okay   again   on   my   own ,   i   just   don   t   want   to   mess   with   it   ,   i   have   never   taken   this   car   seat   out   of   the   car ,   instead   i   always   offer   to   drive .   because   again   a   it   s   a   little   tricky   to   install   mostly   because   it   is   so   big   and   b   it   is   so   big   .   that   being   said ,   i   really   love   this   car   seat   and   feel   so   good   about   having   made   this   purchase   and   have   recommend   it   to   friends   and   family .   i   love   knowing   that   my   little   one   is   safe ,   secure ,   and   pretty   darn   cozy   in   her   car   seat .
this   is   how   mommy   gets   things   done   in   a   pinch ...   the   product   itself   is   everything   wonderful   that   you   would   expect   from   fisher   price .   the   colors   are   cheerful   and   fun   and   also   unisex ,   which   is   a   great   bonus   if   you   d   like   to   get   plenty   of   use   out   of   this   item   or   eventually   pass   it   along   to   someone   else .   the   seat   swivels   so   your   baby   can   swing   in   either   of   two   directions ,   front   to   back   or   side   to   side ,   whichever   he   or   she   finds   more   comforting .   the   little   mirrored   ball   at   the   top   and   the   spinning   alligators   and   bird   are   lots   of   fun   for   baby   to   look   at .   the   music   is   very   nice ,   not   annoying ,   and   everything   is   adjustable   the   volume   of   the   music ,   the   intensity   of   the   swinging ,   the   movement   of   the   mobile ,   etc .   br   br   what   moms   really   love   about   this   type   of   product   though   is   how   soothing   a   swing   can   be   for   their   baby .   some   people   use   swings   on   a   regular   basis ,   but   i   tend   to   save   it   for   special   occasions   when   there   s   something   else   i   really   need   to   get   done ,   or   if   i   need   to   get   dressed   and   ready   quickly .   i   m   able   to   set   the   baby   in   here ,   fire   it   up ,   and   he   stays   happy   and   enthralled   until   we   re   ready   to   go .   at   first   i   thought   it   seemed   like   a   lot   of   money   to   spend   for   something   that   the   baby   may   or   may   not   like ,   but   i   m   glad   i   paid   attention   to   all   the   moms   who   wrote   amazon   reviews   that   claimed   swings   are   an   essential   component   in   any   nursery .   br   br   the   reason   i   selected   this   larger   style   swing   instead   of   the   papasan   variety   is   because   it   s   comfortable   for   the   baby   for   a   longer   time .   even   though   i   believe   both   styles   are   rated   to   accommodate   babies   within   the   same   weight   ranges ,   i   believe   the   contouring   and   seat   shape   of   this   model   will   prove   more   comfortable   for   a   longer   period   of   time .   the   adjustable   seat   back   and   removable   newborn   padding   insert   will   allow   you   to   use   this   item   from   birth   through   many   months   after .
i   do   like   it   but ...   ok ,   it   s   a   good   stroller ,   love   the   design ,   the   2   trays   the   easy   open   close   mechanism ,   but   the   front   wheels   have   been   acting   up   since   the   day   it   was   purchased .   they   do   tend   to   fix   themselves   though ,   which   i   don   t   quite   understand   how ,   but   they   do .   it   s   just   very   bothersome   if   you   go   over   uneven   ground   sometimes   even   ground ,   the   front   wheels   feel   like   they   are   going   to   come   off   makes   the   whole   stroller   shake !   my   3   yr   old   doesn   t   mind ,   since   she   thinks   it   s   funny ,   but   a   younger   child   may   not   handle   it   as   well .   anyway ,   for   the   price   we   got   it   for ,   i   m   fine   with   it ,   but   had   i   paid   more ,   i   would   have   found   a   way   to   send   it   back !
perfect   toddler   plate   but   the   utensils   aren   t   that   great   i   love   this   plate , the   plate   actually   stays   in   place   and   doesn   t   move   all   over   the   table .   before   i   purchased   the   plate ,   i   read   in   a   review   that   the   utensils   are   not   strong   enough   and   i   totaly   agree   with   that   review .   the   fork   and   spoon   are   not   very   good .   i   had   already   utensils   for   my   son   and   didn   t   really   care   about   the   quality   of   the   utensils .   the   plate   is   not   on   the   cheap   side   but   i   love   it   regardless

wonderful   chair   i   purchased   this   for   my   daughter   and   her   husband   who   are   expecting   their   first   child   my   1st   grandchild !   .   they   love   it !
bath   time   fun   i   saw   this   in   one   of   the   free   family   magazines   in   the   libraries .   i   though   it   was   a   cool   idea .   my   kids ,   the   younger   ones   5   3   loves   to   play   with   cups   pouring   water   while   having   their   bath   time .   my   first   reaction   when   i   got   it   was   that   it   was   too   small .   the   biggest   one ,   the   blue   caterpillar   head   is   only   about   3   inch   in   diameter .   but   when   i   saw   them   playing   with   it   in   the   tub ,   i   think   it   is   just   the   right   size   for   their   little   hands .   still ,   depending   on   how   you   look   at   it .   you   may   want   to   consider   the   price   to   pay   for   a   small   plastic   toy   cups   such   as   this   one .   they   do   look   great ,   they   are   very   colorful ,   and   they   were   made   with   quality   plastic   material .   each   piece   is   numbered   one   to   seven   which   my   5   year   old   had   no   problem   following   the   sequence   and   snap   them   together   to   make   it   the   full   caterpillar   as   shown   in   the   pic .   snapping   them   together   is   not   easy   though   even   for   a   5   year   old   boy .   i   have   to   help   him   push   the   tabs   to   the   holes   as   they   are   pretty   tight .   they   had   fun ,   but   they   were   not   too   excited   about   the   new   toy   as   i   thought   they   would   be .

painted   over   rust   i   purchased   3   of   these   and   the   first   one   opened   had   peeling   paint   where   it   had   been   painted   over   rust .   i   was   able   to   return   all   3   without   difficulty   to   amazon . com   it   should   also   be   noted   that   these   are   permanent   installations ,   meaning   you   can   t   remove   the   gates   from   the   hinges   temporarily .   for   this   reason ,   i   would   recommend   the   kidco   safeway   g20 .
worth   every   penny ! !   bought   this   when   our   son   was   3   months   old .   wish   we   d   bought   it   the   day   we   brought   him   home !   our   baby   was   a   massive   spitter   upper   and   more   than   once   choked   on   spit   up .   he   also   insisted   on   sleeping   on   his   belly   screamed   and   threw   a   fit   if   he   was   on   his   back   and   just   refused   to   sleep   he   learned   how   to   roll   over   at   a   very ,   very   young   age   as   well   as   he   was   so   adamant   that   he   sleep   on   his   belly .   before   we   bought   this   i   could   not   get   a   decent   night   s   sleep   for   fear   that   something   was   going   to   happen   to   him   i   kept   waking   up   constantly   to   check   on   him   and   every   little   noise   would   send   me   into   a   fully   awake   panic .   this   product   works   like   a   charm !   the   alarm   did   go   off   a   couple   of   times   and   woke   him   up   enough   to   start   breathing   again   or   got   us   up   in   time   to   help   the   baby   it   sets   off   the   alarm   if   no   motion   is   detected   for   10   seconds   .   it   saved   my   sanity   and   most   likely   my   precious   baby .   i   would   strongly   suggest   this   to   anyone   it   may   seem   expensive   but   after   having   used   it   i   would   have   happily   paid   a   great   deal   more .   the   only   thing   to   remember   is   when   they   wake   up   to   eat   in   the   middle   of   the   night   you   need   to   remember   to   shut   off   the   monitor   or   you   will   scare   your   spouse   to   death   when   the   alarm   goes   off .  
got   worse   and   worse   want   to   buy   a   different   baby   monitor .   i   bought   because   got   good   ratings ,   cheap ,   one   of   the   few   monitors   that   came   with   2   parent   units .   had   for   3   months   now .   live   in   a   3   floor   condo   complex   and   it   just   got   more   and   more   static   lately .   noticed   differences   when   turn   certain   lights   on   or   charging   cell   phones .   no   good .   it   s   starting   to   wake   us   up   b   c   of   static   noise   changes   throughout   night .   it   picks   up   noise   well   though   and   i   like   the   fact   that   it   has   the   light   indicator   for   noise .   i   also   like   that   it   has   option   of   ac   or   rechargeable   battery .   but   i   would   not   recommend   to   another   person .   update   5   10   2010   not   sure   if   it   had   to   do   with   new   tenants   moving   in   or   another   baby   moving   in   next   door   so   they   had   a   baby   monitor   too   or   more   wireless   things   we   bought   or   what ... but   it   was   causing   huge   static   interference   on   the   parent   units   that   sounds   like   old   radios .   we   could   hear   other   people   sometimes   too .   we   could   still   hear   the   baby   when   he   cries   but   it   was   with   the   static   in   background .   the   static   was   just   so   annoying   at   night   and   we   would   just   turn   the   unit   off   sometimes .   living   in   an   older   condo   too ,   i   m   sure   the   other   tenants   who   are   elderly   people   had   same   frequency   electronics   that   makes   it   worse .   but   we   just   gave   in   after   5   months   of   bearing   with   the   static   and   bought   this   philips   one ,   we   re   happy   with   our   buy   so   far   even   without   2   parent   units .   not   a   big   deal   to   just   bring   the   parent   unit   with   us .
three   years   old   and   going   strong   i   purchased   this   soother   three   years   ago   when   we   had   our   first   child .   it   was   one   of   the   few   purchases   as   a   newbie   parent   that   i   actually   got   right   on   the   first   try .   i   love ,   love ,   love   the   music   and   nature   noises   on   this   soother .   in   my   experience ,   others   tend   to   have   a   tinny   or   canned   electronic   quality   to   their   sound ,   but   both   the   nature   sounds   and   songs   are   realistic   and   quite   pleasant .   i   also   love   the   bubbling   water ,   which   makes   a   soothing   gurgling   noise ,   and   the   hypnotic   swing   of   the   monkey .   the   backlight   of   the   waterfall   shifts   subtly ,   mimicking   the   movement   of   real   water   shimmering   in   the   light .   the   lowest   volume   setting   is   perfect .   but   enough   about   me .   the   proof   is   in   the   pudding ,   and   my   now   three   year   old   daughter   still   uses   this   soother   every   night   to   fall   asleep .   starting   when   she   about   7   months   old ,   i   would   stumble   into   her   bedroom   after   hearing   her   cry   out   in   the   night ,   only   to   find   her   back   on   her   tummy   with   the   soother   on ,   sleeping   soundly .   heaven !   there   has   been   literally   no   deterioration   of   this   product   after   multiple   nightly   uses ,   three   years   running .   as   for   the   brightness ,   i   suppose   that   s   a   personal   preference .   my   daughter   never   seemed   bothered   by   the   light ,   which   to   me   seems   no   brighter   than   your   average   nightlight .   maybe   the   color   of   the   light   makes   it   seem   brighter   since   its   ambient   glow   is   blue ,   it   is   inherently   more   noticeable   it   is   true   that   the   monkey   on   our   soother   does   emit   a   small ,   plasticky   creak   when   swinging .   the   volume   of   the   creak   is   quiet   enough   that   it   doesn   t   present   a   problem .   besides ,   as   many   parents   will   tell   you ,   children   particularly   infants   will   often   find   comfort   in   repetitive   noises   that   we   may   consider   grating .   the   monkey   s   noise   is   rhythmic ,   quiet ,   and   consistent   i . e .   it   makes   the   same   exact   noise   for   the   same   exact   duration   each   time   ,   so   in   my   experience ,   it   doesn   t   detract   at   all   from   the   soothing   qualities .   when   we   had   our   second   daughter   two   months   ago ,   i   was   foolishly   trapped   into   a   world   of   pink   like   i   never   was   with   my   first   girl ,   so   i   bought   the   pink   fisher   price   dreamland   soother .   i   really   wish   i   d   just   purchased   a   second   rainforest   one .   the   sounds   on   the   dreamland   are   fake   and   too   loud ,   and   the   projection   feature   is   a   weak   stream   of   light   emitting   at   too   awkward   an   angle   to   position   where   baby   can   see .   trust   me   i   got   it   right   the   first   time .   you   should ,   too !
a   life   saver   i   bought   this   a   month   ago   when   my   son   was   4   months   old .   he   instantly   loved   it .   now   he   is   able   to   roll   around   the   kitchen   and   house   and   is   figuring   out   the   many   musical   options .   i   have   seen   the   ones   in   the   stores   and   by   far   this   is   the   best   one .   he   once   spit   up   too   much   on   the   toy   part   and   it   malfunctioned .   i   took   it   off   and   wiped   it   then   let   it   dry   and   now   it   works   great .   i   rotate   him   from   the   bumbo   seat   to   this   and   sometimes   the   bouncy   he   is   getting   bored   with   that   one   .   he   gets   bored   easily   and   this   is   the   one   place   i   can   put   him   that   keeps   him   safe   and   happy   for   some   time .   the   only   thing   is   it   is   difficult   to   remove   the   seat   to   clean   it   if   there   s   a   diaper   leak .   it   is   easier   to   wash   it   without   removing   it .   i   love   this   walker   and   it   looks   fabulous   too .
it   was   a   gift   this   item   was   a   gift ,   so   i   am   unsure   how   to   rate   the   exact   product ,   but   ordering   and   shipping   worked   out   great !   thx
graco   imonitor   vibe   inferior   frustrating   this   was   one   of   the   few   selections   at   target .   what   a   disappointment   rip   off   this   has   been .   the   charge   runs   out   in   less   than   12   hrs   the   signal   is   unreliable .   also ,   there   is   no   sound   activated   feature ,   so   there   is   an   annoying   constant   low   level   of   white   noise   for   those   precious   few   hours   of   sleep   that   parents   do   get   as   sound   sensitive   as   we   new   moms   are ,   i   have   found   this   very   frustrating   .   we   had   a   sony   baby   call   as   our   first   monitor   for   our   older   child   but   i   thought   we   couldn   t   go   wrong   with   graco .   i   would   stronly   recommend   testing   your   monitor   out   thoroughly   before   you   need   to   use   it .
jj   cole   infant   bundle   great   product ,   though   sometimes   i   wish   the   product   had   large   industrial   snaps   rather   than   a   zipper   so   it   would   be   a   little   easier   and   quicker   to   use .   sometimes   it   can   be   a   bit   tough   to   get   zip   in   place   and   sometimes   i   accidently   unzip   too   far   down   and   it   comes   unzipped   completely .   it   is   very   warm ,   in   fact   sometimes   the   top   part   doesn   t   need   to   be   on   very   much   because   just   having   the   fleecy   bit   underneath   the   baby   is   enough !
great   bottles !   we   love   these   bottles .   we   had   to   find   an   alternative   to   glass   bottles   with   removable   rubber   sleeves   because   our   daycare   was   worried   about   shattering   glass   if   they   were   dropped .   with   these ,   there   is   no   risk   of   shattering   glass   at   all .   and   we   like   them   better   than   the   removable   sleeves   because   no   water   gets   trapped   between   the   sleeve   and   bottle ,   which   can   be   messy   and   annoying .   plus ,   our   removable   sleeves ,   by   evenflo   were   constantly   breaking .   the   only   negative   about   these   bottles   is   that   the   ounce   markers   are   extremely   hard   to   read ,   especially   when   filled   with   milk .   the   price   is   excessively   high   so   we   are   managing   with   only   three   bottles   for   daycare .   wish   the   price   would   go   down   so   we   could   afford   more .
love   it !   we   love   this   soft   and   absorbent   bath   wrap !   3   of   my   kids   7 ,   4   and   2   years   old   own   these   bath   wraps   and   they   love   them   so   much !   my   son ,   who   is   7 ,   loves   the   fact   that   he   just   steps   out   of   the   shower ,   puts   the   wrap   on ,   walks   to   his   room ,   and   he   is   quickly   dried   off .   he   noticed   that   this   bath   wrap   absorbed   much   quicker   than   his   previous   wrap   from   a   different   company .   i   love   the   soft   feel   of   the   robes   and   enjoy   how   the   kids   don   t   complain   about   being   cold   when   wearing   it   like   they   usually   do   with   their   regular   towels .   i   recommend   this   item ,   which   would   make   a   great   gift !
  i   love   the   color   and   design   of   this   wrap   .   above   all   large   size   packing   my   two   year   baby   is   good .
cool   nightlight   my   daughter   received   this   nightlight   as   a   gift .   so   far   so   good   it   truly   is   not   hot   to   the   touch   which   is   good   since   most   other   nightlights   are   hot   by   morning   quite   amazing .   additionally ,   the   colors   are   not   that   bright ,   it   is   the   first   nightlight   that   doesn   t   make   her   room   bright .   it   is   very   soft   light ,   and   the   colors   change   gradually .   my   daughter   kept   waking   up   at   4am .   since   she   got   this   nightlight   she   has   been   sleeping   through   the   night .   last   night   from   7   30pm   until   7   30am   i   don   t   know   if   it   has   anything   to   do   with   the   light ,   but   it   started   that   night .   supposedly ,   there   are   some   free   stories   you   can   register   and   watch   online   we   have   yet   to   do   that .   but   the   nightlight   is   pretty   cool .
great   car   seat   we   bought   two   of   these   seats   one   for   the   lexus   the   other   for   the   bmw   and   love   them .   the   colors   blend   nicely   and   the   baby   is   happy .   no   complaints .
great   for   travelling !   i   used   these   over   a   holiday   weekend   while   we   were   travelling .   they   made   it   a   bit   easier   i   could   pack   all   of   our   normal   bottles   in   our   bags ,   and   use   these   in   the   car .   all   of   the   instructions   were   for   formula   fed   babies ,   and   our   daughter   is   solely   breastfed ,   but   obviously   you   can   figure   it   out .   i   liked   that   these   were   single   use   so   that   i   didn   t   have   to   worry   about   storing   dirty   bottles .   i   have   a   tendency   to   forget   because   we   so   seldom   use   bottles   and   i   have   found   very   unpleasant   reminders   weeks   later .   with   these ,   that   is   taken   care   of .   i   don   t   have   to   feel   bad   about   wasting   a   perfectly   good   bottle ,   or   trying   to   salvage   it .   i   also   liked   the   wide   design .   we   use   the   playtex   drop   ins   on   the   rare   occasions   that   our   daughter   even   gets   a   bottle ,   and   these   were   very   similar   as   far   as   nipple   width   and   flow   rate .   she   didn   t   seem   to   mind   using   them   at   all .   they   didn   t   seem   to   give   her   gas   or   anything   like   other   solid   plastic   bottles ,   either .   she   get   gassy   really   easily ,   so   we   are   always   careful   when   bottle   feeding ,   but   even   with   being   in   the   car   seat   for   14   hours ,   it   wasn   t   a   problem !   what   i   don   t   like   is ,   of   course ,   the   cost   effectiveness .   i   hate   to   use   anything   once   and   throw   it   away .   however ,   the   convenience   that   it   brought   was   worth   it .   we   don   t   travel   very   often   because   we   have   multiple   pets   and   3   children   under   the   age   of   5 .   this   was   a   nice   one   time   deal   for   us ,   but   probably   not   anything   i   would   do   all   the   time .   bottom   line   for   me   offers   great   convenience ,   very   well   designed ,   but   at   a   dollar   per   bottle ,   i   am   glad   i   don   t   travel   or   feel   the   need   to   use   these   very   often .  
our   son   loves   it !   we   got   this   for   our   5   month   old   son ,   james ,   and   he   just   loves   it .   the   music   is   very   fun   and   he   loves   bouncing   to   it .   the   toys   catch   his   attention   especially   the   dangling   parrot   and   banana   .   this   has   a   really   cute   padded   monkey   seat   too   that   s   washable !   .   the   chair   swivels   so   that   he   can   look   all   around   him .   we   re   getting   a   lot   of   use   out   of   this !   we   definitely   recommend   this   for   any   baby   who   is   starting   to   sit   up   on   his   own .
just   average !   i   gave   this   bag   3   stars   because   it   s   just   a   average   diaper   bag   that   can   br   be   found   at   walmart .   the   price   isn   t   bad   by   any   means   but   for   gerber   br   i   expected   something   more   sturdy   and   durable .   this   is   just   an   average   br   walmart   bag
decal   is   a   stick   on ,   onsies   are   plain   this   should   have   been   very   cute   gift   for   a   new   mom .   the   onesies   are   all   adorned   with   cute   as   a   button   decals .   unfortunately   these   decals   are   only   stuck   on   with   some   adhesive   tape ,   they   are   not   permanently   sewn   on   to   the   onesie .   for   this   price ,   i   would   expect   a   cuter   onesie   than   a   plain   white   one   which   you   can   buy   in   a   6   pack   k   mart   for   cheap   rolled   in   a   ball   with   a   sticker   on   top .   overall ,   very   disappointed .   would   have   been   a   super   cute   idea   if   the   onesies   all   had   permanent   decorations   on   the   chest .

horrible   monitor ,   would   not   buy   again   i   added   this   monitor   to   my   baby   registry   because   it   had   decent   reviews   for   a   reasonably   priced   monitor .   boy   do   i   regret   it   now !   my   son   is   only   7   months   old   and   i   am   having   to   purchase   another   one   and   i   don   t   even   use   it   during   the   night ,   only   for   nap   time .   the   sound   is   broken ,   you   have   to   turn   it   all   the   way   up   to   be   able   to   hear   the   baby   at   all ,   it   crackles   and   you   can   hardly   go   two   rooms   away   or   it   doesn   t   come   in   at   all .   battery   life   is   also   not   the   greatest   and   you   need   to   recharge   pretty   frequently .   i   would   never   buy   this   product   again !
it   never   stops !   blue   version   i   say   never   stops   cause   that   s   the   only   complaint   i   have   about   this   toy .   once   it   starts   talking ,   it   continues   to   give   reminders   for   a   while   before   shutting   off .   however ,   i   like   this   toy   a   lot .   it   has   three   different   levels .   if   you   place   the   activity   center   on   the   floor   off   the   stand ,   it   plays   certain   games   and   tunes   with   every   moving   part   it   has   on   it .   at   any   age ,   they   can   play   with   this   stage   cause   it   has   a   handle   and   they   can   carry   it   or   drag   it   wherever   they   go ,   or   just   press   the   buttons   on   it   to   make   noise .   then   if   it   s   on   the   second   level   in   which   the   activity   center   is   on   the   stand   facing   forward   and   the   handle   is   towards   the   ground ,   it   plays   different   tunes .   not   too   many   different   ones ,   but   there   s   a   slight   difference .   my   boys   liked   this   stage   fairly   well .   they   d   get   up   easily .   it   was   stable   for   them   at   that   stage .   when   the   activity   center   was   upright ,   it   again   played   different   tunes   geared   more   towards   driving   instructions   like   when   to   stop ,   be   careful ,   and   so   on .   also   this   would   be   the   time   to   unlock   the   wheels   so   they   can   walk   around   with   the   toy   on   the   stand .   they   would   pull   themselves   up   on   this   all   the   time .   they   didn   t   start   knocking   it   over   until   they   were   about   14   or   15   months .   the   boys   got   this   toy   when   they   were   about   8   or   9   months   and   they   are   still   playing   with   it   at   17   months .
amazing ! ! !   as   first   time   parents ,   we   were   given   the   choice   to   use   a   pacifier   in   the   hospital .   after   much   debate   b   c   of   breastfeeeding ,   we   decided   to   let   our   son   have   it   b   c   our   son   was   just   very   inconsolable   while   my   milk   came   in .   nothing   worked   to   soothe   him   not   shooshing ,   not   swaddling ,   not   anything   and   not   even   the   hospital   nurses   could   soothe   him .   this   was   a   godsend !   it   did   not   contribute   to   any   breastfeeding   problems   and   has   been   the   best   thing   to   calm   our   son .   he   is   now   3   months   old   and   only   wants   it   when   is   very   stressed   so   he   is   not   dependent   upon   it   all   the   time ,   did   not   have   nipple   confusion   and   had   learned   to   self   soothe   for   the   most   part   now   by   sucking   his   fingers .   it   is   really   a   great   product   and   i   recommend   it   to   anyone   wanting   to   use   a   pacifier   for   their   baby .   our   son   refuses   to   use   any   other   brand   or   type   but   the   soothie   for   the   sucking   action   is   calming   to   him   like   when   he   is   feeding .
cute   but   less   functional   i   bought   this   with   the   26   pieces   letter   ones   for   my   10   month   old .   they   look   really   cute   but   the   little   pieces   tend   to   fall   off   if   pressed   i   put   them   on   the   carpet   .   i   have   to   put   them   at   places   where   baby   do   not   usually   go .   if   you   have   carpet   i   would   recommend   the   letters   and   numbers .
baby   item   adorable   merchandise .   excellent   quality .   very   fast   shipping .   would   recommend   and   buy   from   again
does   not   stay   up   waste   of   money   this   thing   is   the   worst   piece   of   junk   i   ve   ever   ordered !   i   ve   put   up   4   metal   gates   throughout   the   house   so   far ,   and   needed   2   more ,   so   i   figured   i   would   buy   this   since   it   s   so   much   cheaper   than   the   metal   gates ... turns   out ,   this   thing   is   a   piece   of   junk .   i   spent   over   an   hour ,   trying   to   get   it   to   stay   up ,   but   each   time   i   let   go   the   darn   thing   would   fall   right   off !   it   simply   doesn   t   extend   tightly   against   the   walls   like   it   supposed   to ... instructions   were   vague ... i   packed   it   back   up   and   will   be   returning   it   for   sure .
would   recommend ! !   the   bassinet   is   very   beautiful   and   is   made   of   strong   wood !   its   not   too   heavy   and   was   incredibly   easy   to   put   together .   the   only   thing   that   went   somewhat   awry   was   putting   on   the   wheels .   they   would   not   fit   into   the   bottom   of   the   legs   because   the   inserts   were   much   too   wide   and   long ,   however   this   was   not   an   issue   for   me   because   i   do   not   intend   to   roll   the   bassinet   anywhere .   but   if   i   need   to   move   the   bassinet   i   can   because   it   doesnt   weigh   much   and   is   easy   to   lift .   i   would   definitely   recommend   this   product .   nothing   came   damaged   and   shipping   was   easy .
scratchy .   this   item   purchased   elsewhere   is   much   softer .   these   gerber   diapers   usually   make   great   burp   rags   and   are   not   at   all   good   as   cloth   diapers   .   this   package ,   however   was   very   scratchy .   i   purchased   some   a   week   later   at   target   which   were   very   soft   and   what   i   expected   from   the   product .   i   wouldn   t   purchase   this   item   through   amazon   again   because   of   the   quality .
adorable   this   kidsline   b   is   for   bear   baby   crib   bedding   set   is   so   adorable .   i   had   a   difficult   time   finding   a   neutral   teddy   bear   theme   until   i   found   this   one   it   is   perfect   for   either   a   baby   boy   or   girl .   the   materials   are   soft ,   nice ,   and   durable   not   the   cheap ,   scratchy   materials   that   you   find   in   similarly   priced   bedding   sets .   the   only   difficulty   that   i   encountered   was   finding   the   other   matching   items   lamp ,   mobile ,   etc .   it   appears   that   kidsline   no   longer   makes   this   product ,   so   good   luck   in   piecing   it   all   together .
just   be   aware ,   the   engineering   here   is   miserable   1 .   trying   to   get   these   things   on   the   correct   side   is   very   easy   to   screw   up ,   and   if   you   do   it   wrong ,   you   have   to   yank   with   all   of   your   might   to   get   them   back   out .   2 .   the   adapters   have   to   come   off   before   you   can   put   it   in   the   car   seat   base   3 .   putting   the   car   seat   on   off   these   adapters   is   extremely   difficult   and   takes   a   lot   of   force .   i   have   no   idea   how   even   i   ll   be   able   to   do   it   with   a   baby   in   the   seat .   i   doubt   my   wife   could   do   it   now .   you   literally   have   to   step   on   the   frame   of   the   stroller   and   pull   very   hard   to   free   the   carseat .
a   disapointment   in   cloth   diapering   my   mom   used   gerber   cloth   diapers   on   me   and   my   3   siblings   when   we   were   growing   up   and   i   believe   the   quality   of   the   ones   made   back   then   must   have   been   better   than   what   i   ve   got   today .   i   bought   a   pack   of   12   and   2   of   them   ripped   at   the   seams   during   their   first   wash .   they   don   t   seem   to   be   very   absorbent   at   all   they   wick   through   my   son   s   diaper   covers   and   clothes .   they   do   make   good   burp   rags ,   though .   i   bought   some   of   the   chinese   prefolds   and   i   m   hoping   to   have   better   luck   with   them .
does   what   it   s   supposed   to .   easy   to   install .   this   car   seat   base   does   what   it   s   supposed   to   do   hold   the   carseat   in   place .   it   s   got   built   in   leveling   bubbles   to   assist   with   proper   install .   it   can   be   installed   via   latch ,   lap   belt ,   or   shoulder   lap   belt .   i   ve   tried   all   3   and   had   no   issues .   what   more   can   i   say   if   you   have   a   chicco   keyfit   or   keyfit   30 ,   this   is   a   great   additional   base .
baby   book   boy   it   s   nice   but   i   thought   it   would   be   a   little   nicer   for   the   price .   the   ribbon   is   a   little   cheap   looking .   i   saw   a   similar   one   somewhere   else   with   much   nicer   ribbon   and   thought   this   would   be   the   same   product .   my   mistake   i   guess .   the   inside   pages   are   vey   nice   though .
not   loud   enough   this   was   my   first   digital   monitor   purchase .   i   was   replacing   the   analog   sony   we   got   when   our   son   was   born .   digital   is   definitely   the   way   to   go   because   there   s   no   static .   however ,   this   just   doesn   t   get   nearly   loud   enough .   for   109   it   should   at   least   wake   me   up   when   my   son   is   crying .   the   thing   that   wakes   me   up   is   the   incredibly   bright   illumination   of   the   lights .   perhaps   they   crossed   some   wiring   and   made   the   lights   as   bright   as   the   volume   should   be   loud .   i   ve   very   dissatisfied   and   am   currently   trying   to   get   my   money   back .   i   would   not   recommend   that   anyone   buy   this   product .
3   broken   gates   we   received   three   broken   gates   before   we   were   able   to   piece   together   one   functional   gate .   the   unbroken   finished   product   is   great   and   the   customer   service   was   excellent .   although   they   did   say   they   would   rush   the   replacement   gates ,   both   replacement   gates   took   about   7   days   to   come   in .   but ,   they   sent   them   with   no   hassle .   these   gates   are   poorly   packaged ,   which   may   be   the   reason   they   arrive   with   broken   hinges .
great   for   little   hands   purchased   these   for   my   son   s   1st   birthday .   he   loves   to   throw   and   kick   balls   around .   these   are   perfect   for   his   little   hands .   the   nubbies   make   it   so   easy   for   him   to   pick   up   and   hold   the   ball .   it   also   makes   it   easier   for   him   to   play   ball   with   his   older   brother .   both   of   the   kids   throw   these   around .   they   get   played   with   on   a   daily   basis .
cute   this   monkey   is   super   cute .   dd   is   just   discovering   it   and   loves   to   wave   it   around .   its   a   great   binky   to   take   out   and   about   since   i   tend   to   loose   these   when   they   go   flying   out   of   the   baby   s   mouth .   the   only   down   side   is   that   the   binky   is   permanently   attached   to   the   monkey .   so   you   really   cannot   sterilize   the   binky   and   washing   it   gets   the   monkey   all   wet ,   which   you   re   not   supposed   to   do .   i   still   like   it .   edited   oops ,   i   didn   t   read   the   tag   correctly .   turns   out   you   can   throw   the   whole   thing   in   the   laundry .   works   great .
these   are   great !   these   are   just   like   the   one   they   gave   my   daughter   in   the   hospital .   after   so   many   knockoff   purchases   that   she   wouldn   t   use   i   finally   purchased   these   and   they   are   great !
lifesaver !   the   hospital   where   was   son   was   born   uses   these   pacifiers .   at   first   i   was   worried   about   nipple   confusion   and   concerned   that   the   hospital   gave   him   a   pacifier   without   asking   me .   using   the   soothie   pacifiers   he   has   had   no   problem   with   nipple   confusion .   br   he   loves   these   things .   we   were   given   several   different   types   of   pacifiers   as   gifts   at   my   shower   and   when   we   got   home   we   gave   them   to   him .   he   spit   every   one   of   them   out   immediately .   the   only   pacifier   he   would   use   was   this   pacifier .   br   it   s   shaped   the   same   as   a   nipple   from   a   bottle   and   i   think   that   shape   is   much   easier   for   him   to   suck   on .   br   like   i   said ,   i   was   initially   worried   about   nipple   confusion ,   but   there   are   some   times   when   he   just   wants   to   suck ,   but   isn   t   hungry .   without   the   soothie   pacifiers   we   wouldn   t   have   anything   to   satisfy   that .
wubba   nub   pacifier   it   was   great   except   the   pacifier   itself   was   thinner   than   the   one   we   go   from   the   hospital
uziel   loves   this   my   son   just   hit   4   months .   he   s   been   teething   up   a   storm .   he   always   trys   to   chew   on   the   sides   of   his   paci   so   this   is   perfect .   his   paci   with   more   teething   space !   i   popped   that   puppy   out   of   the   package   and   right   away   he   was   interested   in   it .   i   can   t   believe   how   expensive   some   teethers   are .   this   is   simple   and   cute .   it   looks   great   with   the   soothie   paci   holder .
froggie   this   is   adorable   and   helps   stay   put   better   with   brand   new   baby .   better   to   start   it   right   away   and   very   interesting   to   note   this   is   the   type   pacifier   being   given   at   the   hospital   to   new   babies   now !   all   shapes   and   styles   were   available   on   amazon .   good   shopping   place   and   received   in   just   couple   of   days !
great   product   this   product   really   doesn   t   need   a   review ..   its   a   great   product .   obviously .. thats   why   the   hospitals   give   these   to   the   infants   after   birth .   when   my   son   lost   his   he   wouldnt   take   different   pacifiers   so   we   had   to   buy   a   package   of   soothies .
be   careful   when   your   kids   get   bigger !   we   bought   these   when   my   son   was   born ,   but   he   never   would   take   a   pacifier   when   he   was   an   infant .   he   s   been   going   through   a   bad   teething   spell   this   week ,   and   i   got   out   this   pacifier   to   see   if   it   helped .   surprisingly ,   he   wanted   it   ...   but   then   he   got   the   entire   thing   into   his   mouth   and   nearly   choked   on   it !   he   s   13   months   old .   if   you   re   thinking   of   using   this   item   beyond   your   child   s   infancy ,   you   might   want   to   choose   another   product .   the   package   says   for   all   ages ,   but   they   re   not   big   enough   for   young   toddlers .
best   pacifier   we   have   3   children   and   this   is   the   first   pacifier   that   has   been   enjoyed   by   a   baby   in   our   home .   our   son   chews   on   all   sides   of   it .   it   has   a   delightful   simpsons   look   to   it   when   in   use .   we   have   had   each   size   gradation   and   they   really   do   change   a   lot .   i   love   this   one .   if   he   rolls   on   it   at   night ,   it   s   soft .   i   really   can   t   say   enough   good   about   it .   i   love   that   it   s   bpa   free   and   all   natural   rubber .
nice   i   bought   a   2   pack   of   these ,   and   they   became   the   de   facto   pacifiers   for   my   girl .   they   are   virtually   indestructible !
best   infant   pacifier   in   my   practice   the   majority   of   my   patients   are   infants   and   children .   in   my   office   and   in   the   nursery   we   offer   the   soothie   pacifier   for   comfort   and   infants   who   will   not   suck   on   another   pacifier   are   comforted   by   the   soothie .   the   wubbanub   was   originally   recommended   to   me   by   one   of   my   patients   mothers .   she   has   triplets   and   stated   it   was   a   lifesaver .   my   granddaughter   who   is   4   months   old   has   both   the   frog   and   now   the   monkey   wubbanub   she   and   my   daughter   love   them .
love   this   pacifier   i   got   these   for   my   new   grandson ,   who   is   a   pacifier   baby   with   pretty   good   hand   control   at   four   months   just !   and   we   all   love   them .   i   am   buying   more   to   have   around   to   give   as   gifts   my   son   in   law   s   idea !
didn   t   work   for   my   baby   i   thought   this   was   a   neat   idea ,   because   my   son   often   drops   his   pacifier .   when   i   take   him   out ,   i   use   a   pacifier   clip ,   but   not   while   we   re   in   the   house .   however ,   the   nipple   and   the   shape   of   the   razbaby   is   too   big   and   clumsy ,   he   didn   t   take   to   it .   he   prefers   nuk   pacifiers .
it   falls   off   much   too   easily ! !   i   purchased   this   and   was   only   able   to   use   it   for   a   short   two   weeks ,   until   it   fell   off   of   my   diaper   bag   and   is   lost   already ! !   other   people   s   reviews   stated   that   it   fell   off   too   easily ,   and   i   should   have   listened .   the   strap   that   attaches   it   to   the   diaper   bag   closes   with   a   snap ,   which   is   not   at   all   strong   enough .   it   falls   off   just   from   brushing   against   it .   otherwise ,   it   would   have   been   a   great   accessory .
these   stay   in   better   than   any   pacifier !   i   just   bought   a   bunch   of   these   because   they   re   difficult   to   find   in   stores   now .   this   is   our   third   child   to   use   this   pacifier .   my   first   and   third   son   use   used   these   exclusively .   my   second   son   preferred   another   brand   but   would   use   these   in   a   pinch .   i   have   tried   many   other   brands   and   these   stay   in   better   than   any   pacifier   we   have   tried .
a   must   have   from   day   one ! ! !   my   almost   three   year   old   daughter   has   slept   with   this   cute   bear   since   the   day   she   was   born !   it   is   perfect !   the   volume   can   be   adjusted ,   it   shuts   off   automatically   after   40   minutes ,   and   it   fits   snugly   to   the   side   of   the   crib   with   a   velcro   strap   so   that   it   cannot   possibly   be   removed   by   infants .   now   that   she   s   a   big   kid   in   a   big   kid   bed ,   she   still   falls   asleep   to   the   soothing   sounds ,   but   she   also   likes   to   carry   the   bear   around   and   play   with   him .   the   heartbeat   sound   the   bear   makes   sounds   just   like   what   you   hear   through   the   doppler   at   the   ob   s   office !   our   little   boy   is   due   in   3   1   2   weeks ,   and   we   have   a   bear   on   the   way   for   him ,   too !
you   can   t   separate   the   pacifier   i   thought   that   this   would   be   nice   for   my   infant   to   be   able   to   better   hold   onto   his   pacifier ,   and   it   does   help   with   that   however ,   the   pacifier   is   sewn   into   the   toy ,   so   you   can   t   separate   the   pacifier   to   wash   separately   from   the   toy .   just   not   what   i   was   expecting .
good   in   theory   but   not   so   practical   i   saw   the   overwhelmingly   positive   reviews   and   thought   this   may   be   something   to   help   my   little   one   sleep .   we   tried   lots   of   different   pacifiers ,   but   he   never   really   took   to   any   one   style .   i   thought   i   would   try   this   because   of   the   idea   that   it   could   help   stay   in   his   mouth .   however ,   the   results   weren   t   any   different   from   all   the   other   pacis   we   tried .   maybe   it   works   for   younger   babies   but   at   2   months ,   it   would   still   fall   out   of   his   mouth   when   he   turned   his   head   so   it   didn   t   really   keep   it   in   place .   to   be   fair ,   maybe   my   little   one   just   isn   t   a   pacifier   kind   of   kid ,   which   is   fine ,   but   we   didn   t   have   the   success   that   so   many   others   seem   to   have   with   this   product .   i   was   also   a   bit   hesitant   because   of   the   fact   that   the   pacifier   is   sewn   to   the   plush   toy   but   i   was   willing   to   deal   with   it   at   the   time .   however ,   it   really   would   be   a   much   better   product   if   there   was   a   way   to   separate   for   cleaning .
love   love   love   these   pacifiers !   gumdrop ,   how   do   i   love   thee   let   me   count   the   ways   1 .   one   piece   construction   means   they   are   easy   to   clean .   we   had   problems   with   dirt   collecting   in   the   seal   or   soapy   water   getting   stuck   in   the   nipple   of   other   pacifiers .   with   gumdrop ,   dirt   or   germs   have   no   where   to   collect   and   hide .   2 .   medical   grade   silicon   means   we   can   boil   the   pacifiers   to   sterilize   them   or   run   them   through   the   dishwasher .   3 .   soft   nipple   that   my   baby   loves .   4 .   firm   frame   that   my   baby   loves   to   teeth   on   constantly ,   but   it   s   not   too   hard   for   her   little   teeth   and   gums .   5 .   durability ! ! !   i   wish   every   product   was   as   durable   as   these   pacifiers !   we   ve   been   using   them   24   7   for   10   months   and   they   are   still   in   perfect   condition .   i   check   them   regularly   for   wear   since   she   chews   so   hard   on   them   and   we   treat   them   pretty   rough ,   but   so   far   they   re   perfect !   6 .   bpa   safe .   yes ,   they   are .   the   center   frame   is   not   bpa   free ,   however ,   it   is   completely   covered   by   the   medical   grade   silicone   so   the   baby   is   never   in   contact   with   the   center   frame .   you   shouldn   t   use   it   if   the   silicone   layer   becomes   compromised ,   obviously .   perhaps   if   you   ran   them   over   with   a   car ,   the   silicone   layer   would   be   compromised .   otherwise ,   it   holds   up   amazingly   well .   7 .   the   cut   out   for   the   nose   seems   like   a   little   thing ,   but   it   s   a   big   thing   to   my   baby .   this   is   the   only   one   piece   pacifier   with   the   nose   cut   out   that   i   could   find .   8 .   little   hole   for   a   binky   strap   to   loop   through ,   which   is   critical   for   us .   bottom   line   love   love   love   these   pacifiers !
baby   likes   it   ok   1 .   it   was   not   the   same   as   the   photo ,   but   i   was   too   lazy   to   contact   amazon   about   it .   2 .   baby   only   likes   it   slightly .
love   it   but   with   concerns   i   breastfed   for   two   years   and   let   my   child   self   wean .   this   was   the   only   one   that   was   accepted   about   5   styles   tried   .   i   did   find   the   funk   in   the   seams   issue   to   be   a   bit   gross .   i   soaked   it   in   pure   vinegar   to   freshen   and   disinfect   and   scrubbed   it   with   a   toothbrush   which   worked   great .   however ,   when   i   realized   that   the   rim   had   bpa   in   it   mine   were   from   2008   i   switched   to   the   goldi   natursutten   which   was   an   easy   switch .   it   has   the   same   shape   and   comes   in   different   sizes .   it   is   all   natural   rubber   and   a   wonderful   product .   their   teething   rings   are   great   too .   asin   b001avplra   natursutten   all   natural   rubber   rounded   pacifier ,   6   12   months  
mod   pod   we   bought   this   as   a   gift   for   a   baby   shower ,   then   had   to   go   out   and   get   it   for   ourselves .   we   love   it !   it   is   easy   to   clean ,   easy   to   carry ,   and   looks   fabulous .   highly   recommended !
puppy   pacifier   this   is   a   wonderful   product .   my   daughter   likes   this   brand   of   pacifier ,   and   the   puppy   really   helps   on   a   number   of   levels .   first ,   at   8   weeks ,   she   can   grab   on   to   the   puppy ,   helping   to   keep   the   paci   in   place .   second ,   the   puppy   has   saved   the   paci   part   from   many   falls   no   5   second   rule   needed   .   third ,   the   dog   sits   on   my   daughter   s   chest   while   in   her   chair   or   in   bed ,   so   if   she   spits   out   the   paci ,   it   doesn   t   go   far   and   she   is   often   able   to   retrieve   it   on   her   own   .   fourth ,   it   s   much   harder   to   lose   the   paci   when   there   is   an   adorable   puppy   attached .   the   price   is   reasonable   the   construction   is   very   durable   and   the   dog   is   doggone   cute .   this   is   our   second   kid   and   our   second   round   with   wubbanub   infant   pacifiers   animal   paci   they   have   a   great   selection   and   create   a   truly   reliable   product .
cute   but   flawed   this   is   an   adorable   product   but   it   does   has   some   down   falls .   the   plastic   piece   that   clasps   over   the   nipple   if   the   product   is   removed   or   drop   digs   into   baby   s   face   and   leaves   red   marks   also   plastic   is   rather   thin   and   breaks   easily .   overall   its   a   cute   idea   just   needs   a   few   adjustments .
absolutely   wonderful   one   of   the   best   pacifiers   we   ve   tried .   both   soothie   and   the   newer   version ,   the   gumdrop ,   have   been   real   lifesavers   for   us .   they   don   t   cause   nipple   confusion   in   breastfeeding   infants ,   and   don   t   cause   nipple   pain   for   mommy !   br   br   they   can   be   a   choking   hazard ,   which   is   why   there   are   warnings   that   when   the   baby   can   fit   the   entire   pacifier   including   the   ring   outside   the   nipple   into   their   mouth ,   it   s   time   to   get   rid   of   the   pacifier .   the   company   punched   holes   in   the   ring   in   case   a   baby   does   try   to   swallow   the   entire   pacifier ,   so   the   baby   will   be   able   to   breathe   until   they   get   medical   help .   br   br   wonderful   item   for   upset   babies   or   to   help   a   baby   fall   asleep ,   but   i   don   t   recommend   leaving   it   alone   with   an   unsupervised   infant .
great   paci   for   nursing   moms   this   paci   is   great   for   nursing   moms .   it   helps   the   baby   with   sucking   and   avoids   nipple   confusion .   it   s   also   soft   for   the   baby   to   keep   in   its   mouth .   i   ve   tried   many   different   ones   until   i   got   this   one   and   my   baby   was   hooked   on   it   in   seconds .   he   will   actually   gag   on   any   other   paci   that   i   try   to   put   into   his   mouth .   this   is   the   best   product   ever   created .   the   only   downside   of   this   is   that   i   have   to   order   it   online   and   cannot   get   it   in   the   stores .
thank   goodness   we   found   them !   my   son   got   used   to   this   binky   while   he   was   in   the   nicu   after   he   was   born .   i   couldn   t   find   them   at   any   stores ,   but   was   able   to   find   them   here !
a   great   product ! ! !   i   wanted   to   share   with   everyone   how   great   you   are ! ! !   my   daughter   is   a   little   older   than   the   little   ones   who   you   would   by   this   product   for .   she   is   7months   and   it   is   great   for   her .   not   only   will   she   use   the   pacifier ,   but   she   playes   with   the   kitten .   it   keeps   her   quiet   in   the   car .   i   would   strongly   recommend   this   product   to   others .
the   best   i   got   one   of   these   in   the   hospital   when   my   first   son   was   born   two   years   ago .   i   have   tried   other   pacifiers   from   soothie   and   this   is   the   only   one   that   my   newborn   seems   to   be   able   to   keep   in .   i   was   not   able   to   find   the   gumdrop   version   in   stores ,   so   i   was   so   jazzed   to   find   it   here .   the   baby   is   happy ,   so   mommy   is   happy .
dont   buy   these ,   buy   the   nuk   with   prints   on   them ! ! !   so   here   s   the   deal ... any   of   the   nuk   pacifiers   which   are   plain   colors ... pink   green   white   etc   dont   buy !   they   collect   water   inside   and   you   will   never   squeeze   it   out   or   drain   it   out .   some   reviews   ive   read   on   line   say   you   can   but   trust   me ,   water   stays   inside .   we   have   thrown   out   probaby   about   8   of   these .   i   cant   imagine   that   dirty   old   water   and   soap   is   good   for   my   baby   to   suck   on .   my   baby   loves   the   shape   of   these   pacifiers   so   we   were   fortunate   to   discover   that   the   ones   with   decorative   print   on   the   front   flowers   etc   are   made   differently   and   dont   collect   water !   i   wish   i   had   taken   the   time   to   write   to   nuk   and   send   all   of   those   faulty   ones   back .   i   am   surprised   they   are   still   selling   these   in   the   market .   there   should   be   a   major   recall !
my   son   s   favorite   i   love   these   pacifiers   because   my   son   loves   them   so   much .   i   tried   every   pacifier   i   could   find   on   the   market   and   he   spit   all   of   them   out   except   this   one .   it   is   comforting   to   him   when   he   is   upset   and   works   well   when   it   is   time   to   go   to   bed   since   he   is   weaning   off   his   bottle .   since   they   come   in   a   two   pack ,   i   don   t   have   to   worry   if   one   gets   misplaced .   great   value   and   a   great   price !
love   it ! !   i   have   one   of   these   at   home   already   and   needed   a   new   one   to   replace   the   old .   i   love   these ,   they   are   great   for   your   infant .   my   daughter   loves   it   and   has   so   since   birth .   the   seller   was   great   and   i   got   it   fast   too !   overall   love   it !
my   baby   loves   it   i   had   to   get   this   pacifier   online   because   the   other   one   that   my   baby   had   he   lost   it   and   couldnt   stop   crying ..   he   wanted   his   pacifier   and   the   other   ones   that   he   had   he   didnt   want   it ..   they   were   too   small .   so   i   got   it   and   he   still   loves   it ...   even   though   he   is   growing   and   doesnt   use   it   a   lot   like   before ...   it   will   be   easier   for   me   to   take   it   off .. i   reccomend   this   pacifier   just   try   not   to   lose   it ...   i   went   to   the   store   and   bought   it   but   they   didnt   have   it ..   so   thats   why   i   had   to   order   it   online ..
can   t   live   without   it   this   is   our   second   wubbanub   our   dogs   finally   got   to   the   other   after   4   months   .   we   love   this   thing .   our   baby   was   given   a   soothie   at   the   hospital   but   we   needed   a   way   to   keep   it   off   the   floor .   this   thing   is   a   great   solution .   it   is   easy   to   spot   across   the   room .   when   she   spits   the   pacifier   out   it   will   usually   just   sit   on   her   chest   and   she   can   sometimes   get   it   back   in   on   her   own   even   without   hands .   now   that   she   is   getting   older   she   really   seems   to   like   the   animal   more   and   more .   she   pets   it   to   soothe   herself   to   sleep   and   now   that   she   is   interested   in   toys ,   she   always   has   one   near   even   when   we   forget   all   her   other   toys   .   i   have   never   tried   any   other   pacifiers ,   but   if   your   baby   is   a   soothie   baby ,   then   the   wubba   nub   is   the   way   to   go !
binky   saver   this   is   our   third   haba   binky   pacifier   chain .   it   is   one   of   the   only   chains   we   could   find   to   hold   the   binky   given   to   us   by   the   hospital .   the   clip   is   a   necessity   to   keep   the   binky   off   the   floor   and   attached   to   us ,   the   child ,   or   the   stroller   baby   carrier .   we   would   absolutely   recommend   this   pacifier   chain .
great   idea ,   design   flaws   for   my   baby   anyway   i   loved   the   idea   of   this   pacifier ,   enough   to   shell   out   the   money   it   cost .   we   started   my   baby   on   the   soothie   but   he   never   could   keep   it   in   his   mouth .   after   experimenting   with   a   cheap   o   luvs   orthodontic   pacifier   i   decided   the   orthodontic   shape   would   work   much   better .   first   off ,   the   rubber   discolored   when   i   sterilized   it .   i   don   t   know   if   that   makes   a   difference ,   but   it   came   out   with   a   white   tinge   to   it .   he   took   it   right   away   and   the   shaped   nipple   helped   keep   it   in   but   because   the   shield   hits   his   nose ,   it   still   falls   out   easily .   the   shields   that   are   shaped   to   the   face   seem   to   help   him   keep   it   in   more   easily .   another   flaw   is   that   the   loop   sticks   out   from   his   face ,   and   since   my   son   grabs   at   everything   he   can ,   he   keeps   pulling   it   out   of   his   mouth .   maybe   if   he   wasn   t   in   such   a   grabby   stage   or   was   more   able   to   keep   it   in   his   mouth   i   would   have   liked   it   better .   we   ended   up   getting   a   mam   asin   b00211nrf6   sassy   mam   mini   trends   silicone   pacifier   size   1   0   6   months   boy   colors   and   he   loves   it .   it   isn   t   all   natural   but   it   is   bpa   free ,   and   very   very   pretty .
i   m   sure   it   is   great   for   some ,   didn   t   work   for   us   we   started   out   with   this   pacifier   as   our   doula   recommended   it   and   said   it   was   the   most   compatible   with   breast   feeding .   my   son   took   it   and   it   certainly   helped   in   those   early   days   where   he   wanted   to   suck   24   7 .   he   never   could   keep   it   in   his   mouth   though   which   i   chalked   up   to   being   so   little   and   perhaps   not   convinced   that   he   loved   the   pacifier .   i   wasn   t   convinced   i   wanted   him   to   love   it   so   that   was   ok .   then   at   1   month   he   would   scream   whenever   we   gave   it   to   him   so   we   quit .   at   3   months   though   he   started   sucking   on   everything   and   we   broke   out   the   pacifier   again .   he   could   hold   it   in   his   mouth   for   a   little   while   but   without   careful   attention   it   gets   pushed   out .   now   at   3.5   months   we   need   a   pacifier   so   that   my   husband   might   have   a   chance   of   putting   the   baby   to   bed   when   i   m   not   here   to   nurse   him   down .   the   soothie   falls   out   so   fast   that   there   is   no   chance   it   could   work   to   do   anything   but   comfort   him   when   he   is   really   upset .   with   some   experimentation   we   have   discovered   that   he   needs   a   the   shield   that   is   molded   to   the   face .   the   soothie   shield   and   the   natursutten   asin   b001avnk6e   natursutten   all   natural   rubber   orthodontic   pacifier ,   0   6   months   that   we   tried   bumps   up   against   his   nose   and   gravity   makes   it   more   likely   to   fall   out .   b   a   more   shaped   nipple .   the   orthodontic   ones   work   but   so   does   the   mam   asin   b00211nrf6   sassy   mam   mini   trends   silicone   pacifier   size   1   0   6   months   boy   colors   nipple   which   is   shaped   like   a   bulb   but   theoretically   compresses   to   an   orthodontic   shape ,   though   it   doesn   t   really   when   i   tried   it .   the   bulb   shape   of   the   mam   seems   to   be   enough   to   keep   it   behind   his   gums   which   seems   to   help   it   stay   in   too .   we   just   tried   out   the   mam   and   he   kept   it   in   his   mouth   for   30   minutes   before   pushing   it   out   with   his   tongue   while   playing   !   it   also   has   no   top   bottom   like   the   soothie   so   it   is   easier   to   get   in   his   mouth   in   the   dark .   pacifiers   are   cheap   except   for   the   natursutten   so   it   isn   t   a   big   deal   to   try   a   few   different   ones   just   because   one   baby   does   well   with   one   doesn   t   mean   another   one   will   or   won   t .   but   for   us ,   the   mam   worked   much   better .   i   m   wondering   if   we   should   have   tried   it   earlier   perhaps   it   would   have   been   helpful   in   those   fussy   early   months   where   he   wouldn   t   take   the   soothie .
must   have   for   baby   both   of   my   daughters   have   used   wubbanubs .   we   stumbled   upon   the   first   one   by   accident   and   have   been   hooked   ever   since .   these   have   a   soothie   pacifier   with   an   attached   animal .   the   animal   helps   newborns   keep   the   pacifier   in   their   mouths .   as   the   baby   grows   the   animal   makes   the   pacifier   easy   for   them   find   in   the   dark   and   it   doubles   as   a   lovey .   the   only   draw   back   is   the   animal   is   permanently   attached .   i   have   found   the   easiest   way   to   clean   it   is   to   put   it   in   the   washing   machine .   do   not   put   it   in   the   dryer   this   breaks   down   the   pacifier   .   i   recommend   having   several   wubbanubs   so   one   can   be   washed   while   the   baby   uses   the   others .   you   should   regularly   check   the   pacifier   for   tears   and   discard   when   it   gets   old   and   worn .   i   recommend   having   several   wubbanubs .   i   keep   1   at   day   care ,   1   in   the   car ,   1   in   the   diaper   bag   for   back   up ,   and   1   or   more   in   the   crib .   this   way   i   don   t   have   to   go   searching   when   the   baby   is   crying .   i   also   keep   several   on   hand   to   give   as   baby   shower   gifts .
my   daughter   hates   pacifiers ...   except   for   this   one   i   ll   keep   it   brief .   i   had   resigned   myself   to   the   fact   that   my   daughter   was   just   one   of   those   babies   that   doesn   t   like   pacifiers .   we   had   tried   literally   5   other   brands   of   pacifiers   before   the   binky ,   and   i   really   wish   i   d   just   bought   this   one   first .   with   every   other   pacifier ,   she   would   make   this   disgusted   face ,   and   nearly   spit   it   out   of   her   mouth .   imagine   my   surprise ,   when ,   at   3   months   old ,   i   gave   her   the   binky ,   and   she   sucked   away   happily .   i   thought   maybe   it   was   a   fluke   at   first ,   but   it   always   stops   her   crying .   it   s   a   godsend !
we   love   wubbanub ! ! !   not   only   are   the   wubbanubs   super   cute ,   my   son   can   easily   find   it   in   the   middle   of   the   night   without   waking   up   the   family !
great   item   i   was   worried   because   the   pacifiers   like   this   that   you   purchase   in   the   store   are   not   the   same   as   the   ones   you   get   in   the   hospital .   i   was   very   pleased   with   this   product   and   besides   changing   colors   from   green   to   purple   my   infant   had   no   problem   switching .
my   baby   doesn   t   like   tehm   i   accidentally   bought   these ,   and   tried   them   with   my   baby   anyhow .   she   doesn   t   like   them   at   all .   she   prefers   the   gerber   nuk   pacifiers .
speedy   thank   the   item   arrived   very   quickly .   i   can   think   of   a   multitude   of   uses   for   this   little   bag .
if   you   can   t   poke   fun   at   your   kid ,   what   s   the   point   i   love   this .   some   reviewers   need   to   lighten   up .   our   10   month   old   doesn   t   use   a   pacifier ,   but   we   got   it   in   long   enough   for   a   few   good   snapshots .
now   they   are   bpa   free ! ! ! ! !   old   review   i   bought   these   because   my   baby   likes   soothie   pacifiers   and   i   thought   these   were   cuter .   as   i   read   the   packaging   i   saw   they   have   a   polycarbonate   base   surrounded   by   silicone .   bpa   is   used   to   make   polycarbonate .   the   bpa   is   surrounded   by   silicone ,   but   if   the   silicone   barrier   fails   you   are   giving   your   baby   bpa   to   suck   on .   i   did   notice   the   packaging   very   carefully   says   pthalate   and   latex   free ,   but   no   mention   of   bpa   because   it   is   not   bpa   free .   too   bad   because   i   do   like   them   better   than   the   soothies ,   but   for   me   it   s   just   not   worth   even   the   potential   risk   of   spending   a   good   part   of   the   day   sucking   on   bpa .   edited   to   add   i   noticed   that   they   are   now   listed   as   bpa   free   on   the   website   and   emailed   them .   they   sent   me   back   a   note   that   they   made   a   change   to   the   internal   guard   last   year   and   no   longer   sell   the   ones   with   polycarbonate !   i   found   that   very   very   reassuring   and   would   now   happily   use   them .   from   their   email   our   gumdrop   is   bpa   free .   we   had   made   a   change   to   the   internal   guard   last   year   and   no   longer   sell   the   gumdrop   with   the   polycarbonate   guard .   i   really   respect   a   company   that   responds   to   the   concerns   of   worried   moms !
great   product !   my   son   isn   t   a   big   pacifier   guy   but   he   loves   chewing   in   this   thing !   it   really   provides   some   teething   relief   for   him .   he   has   5   teeth   already   at   10   months   and   this   teether   holds   up   great !
great   product   my   baby   loves   this .   we   used   to   have   problems   with   her   paci   falling   to   the   floor   all   the   time .   now   it   rarely   happens .   she   spits   it   out   and   just   stays   on   her   chest .   and   it   is   so   cute .
best   ever   these   are   a   life   saver   when   you   have   a   hungry   baby   in   the   backseat   of   the   car   and   you   are   driving .   they   will   help   keep   the   pacifier   near   so   the   baby   can   keep   it   in   their   mouth .   it   has   helped   a   great   deal .   it   missed   out   on   5   stars   because   i   wish   their   was   a   way   to   detach   the   pacifer   from   the   animal   so   that   i   could   through   it   in   a   sanitizing   bag   but   these   get   the   old   fashioned   boiled   water   dip   in   water   and   you   have   to   hold   it   in   their   yourself   so   that   s   a   big   downer .
an   absolute   lifesaver ! ! !   this   is   an   absolute   lifesaver .   my   2   month   old   son   tends   to   lose   his   pacifier   a   lot ,   and   the   horse   holds   it   perfectly   in   place .   plus ,   he   loves   to   cuddle   the   horse !   when   he   is   not   using   the   pacifier ,   he   is   cuddling   it .   he   loves   to   chew   on   the   feet   too !   the   only   con   for   this   is   it   s   best   when   used   in   a   swing ,   bouncer ,   carseat ,   etc .   it   tends   to   pop   out   when   he   is   laying   on   his   back   and   turning   his   head   from   side   to   side .   but   it   s   worth   having !   it   ll   pay   for   itself   when   you   don   t   have   to   keep   doing   gymnastics   leaning   over   the   backseat   trying   to   keep   the   pacifier   in   their   mouth   while   driving !
don   t   buy   too   many   of   these   if   any !   we   got   these   from   the   hospital ,   a   couple   of   them .   my   baby   seemed   to   love   them   so   much   that   i   went   nuts   and   bought   6   more .   three   days   after   getting   them   my   baby   was   10   days   old   and   decided   he   didn   t   like   them   anymore .   i   think   they   re   great   for   newborns   at   the   hospital   but   i   dont   think   they   like   them   for   a   long   time .
great   customer   service !   these   pacifiers   are   the   same   kind   that   i   got   from   the   nicu   for   my   daughter   and   she   would   not   use   any   other   brand   or   shape .   this   is   the   only   place   that   i   was   able   to   find   these   pacifiers   and   not   have   to   by   a   whole   box .   i   ordered   these   and   contacted   them   to   fix   something   on   my   order   and   they   were   very   nice   and   helped   me   out   without   any   problems ,   plus   they   still   got   shipped   to   me   very   quickly .   my   daughter   loves   these   and   the   colors   are   so   much   cuter   than   soothie .
baby   loves   it   and   looks   cute   my   son   loves   these   pacifiers   and   has   been   using   them   since   he   was   about   2   weeks   old   he   s   5   months   now   .   the   handle   is   fun   for   baby   i   always   hand   him   his   binky   so   he   can   grab   the   handle   first .   this   way ,   he   decides   whether   he   wants   to   teethe   the   sides   or   suck   on   the   nipple .   they   wash   well   in   the   dishwasher   and   come   out   pristine .   the   construction   is   sturdy   and ,   despite   dire   warnings   in   baby   books ,   the   individual   pieces   will   not   separate   and   become   a   choking   hazard ,   not   even   if   you   tug   on   them   very   hard ,   not   even   after   100   rounds   in   the   dishwasher .
nipple   supposed   to   flex   like   breast   for   breastfed   babies   my   son   seems   to   like   this   style   pacifier   the   best   so   i   went   out   and   bought   two   more   packages .   they   come   in   pink   green   or   blue   green .   buy   them   in   the   store   though   if   you   can   find   them .   i   got   mine   at   target   for   3.49   two   pack .   i   like   that   they   are   very   easy   to   clean .   i   will   either   run   them   through   the   dishwasher   or   in   our   microwave   steam   sterilizer   to   clean .   they   do   not   come   apart   and   it   is   nice   to   have   a   small   handle   to   grab   onto   them   or   clip   a   pacifier   tether   onto   it .   they   do   not   wrap   around   my   son   s   face   like   other   brands   and   they   have   big   air   vents   to   keep   from   having   too   much   moisture   up   against   his   face .
great   idea !   better   products   exsist .   i   think   this   is   a   brilliant   idea !   i   bought   this   for   my   3   months   old   who   is   always   dropping   his   pacifier .   it   solves   that   problem   very   well !   i   also   bought   a   paci   plushie   at   the   same   time .   paci   plushie   is   a   pacifier   holder   so   it   works   with   wide   variety   of   pacifiers   so   you   don   t   have   to   use   the   soothie   if   your   baby   prefers   something   else .   plus ,   if   the   paci   wears   out ,   you   can   just   buy   a   new   2   pacifier   rather   than   a   whole   new   toy !   that   just   makes   more   sense   to   me .   my   baby   happens   to   gladly   take   whatever   pacifier   we   give   him   so   both   work   for   us .   i   am   only   knocking   off   a   star   because   i   think   that   the   idea   of   a   removable   paci   makes   much   more   sense .   wubbanub   works   well   and   has   helped   my   lo   keep   his   paci   in   place .
only   pacifier   my   child   will   use   my   infant   will   only   use   this   pacifier ,   and   i   routinely   recommend   it   to   parents   who   have   tried   other   pacifiers   and   their   child   doesn   t   not   take   to   them .   i   like   that   the   pacifier   is   all   in   one   piece   and   that   there   aren   t   any   hard   parts   to   be   uncomfortably   places   if   lost   in   bed   or   the   car   seat .   this   pacifier   does   not   leave   marks   on   the   face ,   and   the   cut   out   makes   it   so   the   child   s   nose   isn   t   covered .   this   pacifier   is   difficult   to   find   in   retail   stores ,   but   can   be   ordered   in   bulk   from   the   supplier .   my   only   complaint   about   this   pacifier   is   that   ordinary   pacifier   clips   do   not   work   with   this   pacifier .
buy   extras   in   case   the   first   gets   lost   my   6mo   loved   his   little   froggy .   unfortunately   it   is   now   lost   somewhere   in   the   house   or   car ... so   i   d   recommend   buying   extras .
best   pacifier   in   the   world   these   are   the   best   my   son   loves   it .   he   will   not   take   any   others   buy   this   one ,   it   will   make   you   life   alot   better
the   one   and   only   this   is   the   only   pacifier   that   my   son   will   take .   he   was   in   the   nicu   for   23   days   and   this   is   the   pacifier   that   the   hospital   used .   they   also   make   bottles   with   the   exact   same   nipple   as   the   soothie .   i   don   t   use   them   i   use   dr .   brown   s   ,   but   if   you   have   a   picky   nippler   it   might   be   something   to   look   into .
worked   great   for   us ,   well   worth   a   try   at   their   inexpensive   cost .   i   didn   t   want   to   give   my   baby   a   pacifier   at   all .   i   was   paranoid   that   since   i   was   breastfeeding ,   that   any   pacifier   was   going   to   ruin   things ...   but   we   were   at   the   hospital   for   a   test   and   the   baby   was   fussing   a   bit   and   the   nurse   asked   if   we   had   a   pacifier   and   i   said   no .   she   reached   into   the   cupboard   and   pulled   out   one   of   these ,   saying   they   were   highly   recommended .   we   took   it   from   her ,   thanked   her ,   and   threw   it   in   the   diaper   bag .   we   didn   t   try   it   right   then   because ,   as   i   mentioned ,   i   did   not   want   my   baby   to   use   a   pacifier .   br   br   and   then   came   a   time   when   he   was   really   fussy .   and   we   had   just   watched   the   happiest   baby   on   the   block   dvd   and   learned   that   sucking   is   something   that ,   ironically ,   pacifies   a   baby   and   calms   them   down ...   so   i   gave   the   baby   the   soothie ... and   he   loved   it !   loved   it !   i   immediately   went   out   and   bought   two   more   2   packs   from   target   and   babies   r   us   .   i   also   bought   the   next   stage   pacifiers   one   step   up   from   newborn   .   br   br   of   course   if   he   is   super   agitated   or   hungry   then   it   won   t   stay   in   his   mouth ,   but   if   he   is   somewhat   calm   already ,   then   it   s   enough   to   keep   him   calm .   i   never   thought   the   pacifier   was   too   heavy ,   as   another   reviewer   thought ,   claiming   that   was   why   it   wouldn   t   stay   in   the   baby   s   mouth .   i   also   never   thought   the   pacifier   holder   was   too   big .   i   didn   t   have   any   pacifier   attachers   yet ,   so   i   just   bought   the   ones   made   for   this   pacifier   and   it   worked   just   fine .   br   br   as   far   as   the   breastfeeding   worries ,   i   continued   breastfeeding   for   a   few   weeks   after   the   introduction   of   the   soothie   with   no   ill   effect .
cute   wooden   chain   we   had   the   old   haba   pacifier   chains   the   ones   that   detach   in   the   middle   and   was   surprised   by   the   short   length   of   this   one   but   we   found   out   that   this   is   the   new   standard   length .   our   son   uses   the   mam   pacifiers ,   the   ones   without   the   little   ring .   a   good   way   to   attach   them   to   the   chain   is   to   remove   the   silicone   ring   that   comes   with   the   mam   holder   usually   comes   free   with   the   pacifiers   and   put   it   on   this   one .   so ,   all   the   pacifiers   can   be   easily   attached   removed .   however ,   with   the   european   style   pacifiers   the   ones   with   the   ring   attached   this   holder   takes   30   sec .   longer   to   attach .   to   get   the   pacifier   off ,   it   s   a   different   story ,   and   depends   on   how   wet   the   little   cord   gets !   we   ve   had   it   for   a   couple   of   months ,   and   the   cotton   cord   is   surprisingly   sturdy   and   shows   no   wear !   the   clip   is   slightly   loose   since   our   son   realized   that   he   can   detach   it   just   by   yanking   it .
soothie   soothing   the   reason   that   these   pacifiers   are   advertised   as   being   for   children   without   teeth   has   to   do   with   the   fact   that   they   are   made   of   soft   plastic   that   can   be   chewed   through   and   that   babies   with   teeth   3   months   and   up   can   possibly   chew   through   them   and   maybe   swallow   the   pieces .   the   company   that   manufactires   them   makes   a   sturdier   rubber   version   that   cannot   be   bitten   through ,   called   the   super   soothie .   however ,   i   tried   buying   them   for   my   daughter   and   she   hated   them   and   only   uses   the   soothie   has   never   taken   any   other   pacifier .   she   loves   them .   she   is   2   now   so   she   is   ready   to   gradually   wean   from   the   pacifier   altogether .   and   yes   she   has   chewed   a   hole   in   one   or   two   of   them   but   no   harm   done !   but   thats   the   reason   why   the   company   states   that   about   the   teeth .   they   are   not   considered   bad   for   your   child   s   teeth   and   will   be   comparable   in   that   way   to   any   other   pacifier   out   there .   ...   is   the   website   of   the   manufacturer .
only   pacifier   my   baby   will   take   we   ve   tried   out   nearly   all   the   major   brands   of   pacifiers   until   a   seasoned   child   caregiver   recommended   this   one .   it   s   the   only   one   my   baby   will   accept ,   enabling   us   to   use   both   our   hands   now   that   she   doesn   t   have   to   suckle   on   parents   finger .   being   able   to   see   inside   her   mouth   while   is   suckles   is   amusing   as   well .
my   son   loved   his   we   actually   got   about   8   of   these   binkeys   between   shower   gifts   and   what   he   was   given   in   the   nicu   and   we   loved   having   all   of   them .
love   this   little   paci !   my   4   month   old   wouldn   t   take   any   other   pacifier   besides   his   soothie ,   but   had   such   a   hard   time   keeping   it   in   his   mouth !   this   allows   him   to   either   hold   on   to   it   or   for   me   to   tuck   it   under   his   blanket   so   that   it   doesn   t   fall   out   before   he   goes   to   sleep .   and   it   s   so   darn   cute !
very   cute   my   daughter   likes   her   froggy ... i   only   wish   the   pacifier   was   not   sewn   in   so   i   could   switch   it   out   when   it   falls   on   the   floor   without   a   waterfountain   in   site   having   four   or   five   froggys   in   an   already   crammed   diaper   bag   isn   t   practical   .
hillarious !   this   product   looks   hillarious   on   my   son   though   i   would   only   use   it   for   taking   pictures   and   such .   he   really   doesn   t   like   the   shape   of   the   nipple   itself   though   i   ve   seen   some   other   children   like   however  
doesn   t   do   what   the   box   says   it   does   this   thing   didn   t   soothe   my   crying   infant   or   make   her   feel   like   she   was   still   in   the   womb .   i   think   all   these   things   are   gimmicks .   i   handed   this   bear   down   to   a   friend   and   she   said   her   baby   laughed   at   the   bear   sounds .   i   guess   that   s   better   than   crying .
great   paci   my   baby   enjoyed   these   very   much .   the   only   pacifier   she   would   take .   i   like   the   clear   because   it   goes   with   everything .   but   it   is   hard   to   find   sometimes   because   it   doesn   t   have   color .   we   wasted   precious   minutes   trying   to   find   it   when   baby   was   crying .   i   still   liked   the   clear ,   its   unique .   would   buy   again !
gumdrop   pacifier   everything   went   quick   and   was   very   easy .... we   received   the   pacifiers   very   quickly .   i   would   definitely   use   them   again !
not   what   it   seems !   i   order   these   pacifiers   because   it   said   full   term .   i   received   newborn   pacifiers .   it   seems   that   is   the   only   size .   false   advertising ! ! ! !   very   disappointing .   so   if   you   need   newborn   then   this   is   the   product ,   if   not   stay   away   from   the   lies .
love   these   pacifiers   before   my   baby   was   born ,   i   had   read   favorable   reviews   about   the   wubbanub   pacifiers ,   and   so   i   registered   for   them ,   thinking   they   would   be   nice   to   have .   well ,   now   that   i   have   them ,   i   cannot   imagine   life   with   out   them !   not   only   do   they   use   my   son   s   favorite   brand   of   pacifier ,   the   soothie ,   which   most   hospitals   use ,   but   the   lightweight   attached   toy   is   of   great   benefit   by   helping   the   pacifier   stay   in   place !   when   my   son   accidentally   spits   out   the   pacifier ,   instead   of   it   bouncing   off   of   him   to   who   knows   where ,   it   stays   in   practically   the   same   spot ,   just   below   his   chin ,   provided   he   does   not   knock   the   stuffed   animal   out   of   the   way .   i   like   this   system   better   than   any   pacifier   clips   i   ve   used   because   with   the   clips ,   he   ll   spit   out   the   pacifier ,   and   although   it   is   still   attached   to   him ,   it   will   likely   drop   to   his   side   and   far   from   his   mouth .   with   the   wubbanubs ,   the   pacifier   stays   nearby   more   often   than   not ,   and   any   parent   who   has   ever   used   a   pacifier   knows   that   that   is   a   great   thing ! ! !   these   are   definitely   worth   the   money ,   and   be   sure   to   get   at   least   one   for   the   diaper   bag   and   one   for   home !
love   these !   on   a   recommendation   of   a   friend ,   we   ordered   these   for   our   daughter   and   began   using   them   at   2   days   old .   not   only   are   they   similar   to   the   soothies   provided   by   our   hospital ,   these   are   also   recommended   for   nursing   babies ,   because   they   don   t   cause   nipple   confusion .   our   daughter   has   shown   no   signs   of   confusion ,   and   takes   quite   well   to   her   gumdrops .   in   fact ,   i   just   ordered   several   more   sets ,   as   we   ve   lost   quite   a   few   already .   well   worth   the   price   for   our   family ... i   just   wish   i   could   order   them   by   the   dozen !
good   product ....   would   be   better   if   edges   where   softer   product   works   most   times   as   mentioned ... closes   when   falls   down .   this   saves   the   hassle   of   keeping   cases   or   worrying   about   keeping   it   clean .   the   only   issue   that   i   ve   seen   is   after   sucking   on   it   for   a   while   it   forms   marks   around   my   son   s   face .   i   wish   the   edges   were   much   rounded   softer   so   that   this   does   not   happen .   also ,   my   son   has   stopped   taking   it   now ... that   may   just   my   son   does   not   have   to   be   for   all   .   over   all ,   a   good   product .
yay !   just   like   the   ones   they   give   you   in   the   hospital   but   they   never   give   you   more   than   one   so   if   you   lose   it   you   re   out   of   luck !   but   in   cute   colors !   highly   reccomended !
my   son   loved   this   for   waking   hours   this   was   too   big   and   clunky   for   sleeping   with ,   but   he   loved   it   when   he   was   awake .   it   was   fun   for   him   to   play   with   and   use   as   a   teether   in   addition   to   sucking   on   it   like   a   pacifier .
nipple   too   big   for   my   newborn   even   though   this   is   0   6   months ,   my   newborn   gags   on   it .   the   nipple   is   quite   large .   i   am   sure   he   will   grow   in   to   it   i   can   t   wait   for   this   .   i   love   the   idea   of   the   product   and   can   t   wait   to   get   to   use   it .
super   soothie   not   good   for   babys   3   months   w   o   teeth   it   is   important   to   note   the   super   in   super   soothie   means   that   this   is   for   a   baby   with   teeth   it   is   much   harder   than   the   green   soothies   you   first   experience   at   the   hospital .   all   the   packaging   says   is   3   months   so   i   bought   this   thinking   they   were   a   little   bigger   or   more   appropriate   for   a   3   month   old   than   the   original   soothie .   my   baby   is   a   little   over   3   months   and   liked   them   initially   but   they   ended   up   making   him   more   fussy   and   irritated   his   gums .   he   is   not   teething   and   maybe   when   he   does   we   will   get   these   out   again .   it   is   important   to   note   that   the   packaging   and   the   description   here   does   not   alert   you   to   the   fact   that   3   really   means   teething   or   with   teeth .   i   found   that   description   on   the   manufacturers   website .   i   give   it   3   stars   because   it   appears   to   be   the   same   good   quality ,   but   i   think   it   is   important   to   note   that   it   is   confusing .
the   best   pacifier !   they   gave   my   son   this   pacifier   in   the   hospital   and   i   had   to   get   him   more   of   them   since   he   loved   them .   especially   the   vanilla   ones .   i   highly   recommend   them !
great   product   for   your   little   one !   what   a   great   little   bink   espically   for   new   babies .   the   binks   are   nice   and   small   they   don   t   seem   like   they   are   covering   the   whole   face   like   some   other   ones   do .   the   seller   was   amazing !   they   had   my   order   delivered   in   just   a   few   days .   i   would   use   them   again   for   sure !
great ... at   first   i   love   the   womb   sounds   bear ,   however ,   after   only   using   it   for   a   short   time   the   womb   sound   gadget   is   making   a   loud   high   pitched   hum   i   have   not   checked   the   batts   yet   or   what   kind   to   replace ... thought   it   would   last   a   lot   longer   than   that ! !
it   s   cute ,   but ....   the   bear   is   really   cute ,   but   i   can   t   say   that   it   has   helped   my   baby   fall   asleep .   my   son   is   8   weeks   old ,   i   put   it   in   the   crib   with   him ,   but   it   doesn   t   help   him   go   to   sleep   or   stay   asleep .
cute   but .....   the   pink   horse   wubbanub   is   really   cute   and   well   made .   those   are   the   only   positives   i   can   give .   when   i   opened   the   package ,   there   was   a   very   distinct   petroleum   smell   to   the   wubbanub .   i   m   assuming   this   came   from   the   glue   that   holds   the   pacifier   in   the   stuffed   animal .   i   boiled   the   pacifier   three   times   which   is   difficult   and   washed   it   several   times   before   the   smell   went   away .   my   daughter   does   not   like   the   pacifier   at   all .   she   repeatedly   spits   it   out .   as   one   of   the   previous   reviewers   stated ,   the   pink   horse   is   not   very   big   at   all ,   and   is   of   no   assistance   in   keeping   the   pacifier   in   my   daughter   s   mouth .   i   do   not   recommend   this   product .
the   best   pacifier   ever !   got   the   first   one   at   the   hospital   where   my   baby   was   born   and   she   loves   it .   easy   to   clean   and   safe .   i   highly   recommend   it .
amazing   pacifier ! ! !   this   product   is   perfect .   it   won   t   fall   on   the   floor .   i   wish   they   made   these   in   the   vanilla   scented   soothie .
thank   you   natursutten   after   purchasing   probably   30   or   40   pacifiers   for   my   2   month   old   son   so   his   babysitter   wouldn   t   go   insane ,   we   found   the   gerber   soft   center   rounded   pacifier   was   all   he   would   take   mind   you   this   was   the   larger   older   version .   then   gerber   mindlessly   revamped   the   soft   center   to   what   it   is   today .   the   customer   service   rep   said   that   gerber   didn   t   think   babies   would   notice   the   change   well ,   he   did .   he   sucked   on   the   same   two   pacifiers   until   i   found   the   natursutten   a   year   later .   although   they   are   exceedingly   more   expensive ,   i   purchased   five   and   retired   the   gerber .   my   son   barely   noticed   the   change ,   even   though   the   base   is   a   little   wider   the   part   where   his   lips   meet   together   .   thanks   again .   i   would   recommend   this   to   anyone   in   the   same   situation   just   try   one   and   see   if   your   little   one   will   take   it ,   it   s   worth   the   ten   bucks .
stylish   and   does   it   s   job !   great   to   clip   on   to   stroller   handle   and   keeps   the   pacifier   in   it   s   safe   place .
my   son   loves   this !   my   son   has   used   his   froggy   and   ducky   since   he   was   two   months   old   and   he   is   now   21   months   old .   he   loves   them !   we   have   had   both   since   he   was   months   old   and   never   lost   either   of   them .   we   have   had   a   couple   of   scares   but   were   able   to   go   right   back   to   the   places   we   were   and   find   them   right   away .   i   buy   these   for   everyone   i   know   who   is   having   a   baby .   at   least   one   out   of   two   people   i   have   gotten   them   for   use   them   on   a   regular   basis .   they   are   ingenious .
big   hit   our   daughter   loved   this   and   used   it   quite   often   until   she   grew   out   of   it .   highly   recommended .
life   changing ! !   this   product   changed   our   life !   in   the   beginning   the   wub   a   nub   is   great   because   it   acts   as   a   weight   on   the   baby   s   chest   so   that   they   do   not   lose   it   as   often .   you   can   even   wrap   a   swaddle   around   it   to   ensure   that   it   stays   put .   as   they   get   older ,   the   stuffed   animal   is   something   that   they   can   feel   for   and   find   in   the   dark .   my   little   girl   loves   her   wub   and   so   do   her   mom   and   dad !
best   binky !   this   pacifier   was   my   babies   favorite .   its   just   like   the   hospital   one   except   the   little   nose   part   is   cut   out .   its   great !   when   your   baby   is   little   you   will   feel   like   the   hospital   binky   is   pressing   against   the   baby   nose .   it   isn   t ,   but   you   won   t   worry   about   that   with   this   pacifier .   i   buy   a   5   pack   at   a   time   and   give   one   to   every   new   baby   that   is   born   to   my   friends .   its   a   great   gift !
the   only   pacifier   i   ll   use !   this   is   a   great   pacifier !   we   were   given   our   first   set   in   the   hospital   when   we   had   our   daughter .   it   was   recommended   by   the   nurses   who   worked   in   the   pedi   unit .   you   cannot   find   these   in   stores ,   that   i   know   of ,   so   only   option   is   to   order   on   line .   any   parent   that   i   know   who   has   these   cannot   have   enough   of   them !   i   highly   recommend   these   pacifiers   above   any   others   you   can   buy ! !
great   teeth   loved   the   teeth .   they   look   great   on   the   babies   and   are   also   a   great   gift   for   my   equally   goofy   friends .
super   soothie   the   description   of   this   item   did   not   explain   that   it   is   a   much   tougher   rubber   than   the   infant   size .   my   daughter   is   3mo   so   based   upon   the   description   this   is   the   size   i   purchased .   the   rubber   is   so   tough   she   cannot   use   the   soothie .   i   contacted   the   company   on   this   issue   and   received   very   poor   customer   service .   i   would   not   recommend   buying   from   this   company .
wubbanub   this   is   our   second   wubbanub .   my   son   loves   them .   i   do   wish   you   could   somehow   detach   the   pacifier   to   wash   the   animal ,   but   they   re   affordable   enough   that   i   don   t   mind   replacing   them .
the   best   pacifier   out   there   this   pacifier   may   seem   big   and   bulky   to   some ,   but   it   is   the   absolute   best   for   baby   s   mouth   and   teeth   and   my   son   loves   it .   i   plan   on   buying   the   teething   pacifier   soon   as   well .
still   working   great   after   2   1   2   years   we   bought   this   before   my   daughter   was   born .   the   picture   is   amazing   although   if   you   don   t   have   a   spotlight   on   her   you   re   not   going   to   see   anything   near   the   vibrant   color ...   but ,   really ,   is   vibrant   color   why   you   re   buying   this   i   could   see   my   baby   s   chest   rise   and   fall .   but   better   than   anything   is   the   amazing   quality   of   sound   you   get   coupled   with   the   picture .   this   has   saved   me   sooo   many   times   from   running   upstairs   or   it   made   me   have   to   go   upstairs   because   i   can   hear   even   the   faintest   variation   of   her   breathing   pattern   and   i   don   t   even   have   the   volume   up   all   the   way   and   the   camera   is   at   least   5ft   6ft   away   from   her .   the   other   nice   touch   is   that   the   infrared   camera   is   green   not   red   .   at   first   annoying ,   but   my   daughter   doesn   t   even   notice   it   and   it   doesn   t   hinder   her   sleep .   i   have   two   handhelds   of   the   same   exact   product   and   bought   an   additional   camera   and   handheld   and   camera   summer   that   were   not   the   same   model   and   they   integrated   seamlessly .   also   very   easy   to   pack   up   and   set   up   anytime   she   spends   the   night   with   someone   somewhere   else .   over   the   past   6   months   the   sound   began   to   tick   a   bit   annoying   when   you   re   trying   to   sleep   but   it   didn   t   do   that   on   all   handhelds   so   we   just   switched   them   out .   lastly ,   all   are   now   plugged   in .   you   get   much   clearer   reception   both   voice   and   picture   quality .   now   that   i   m   out   of   the   newborn   stage   i   don   t   feel   i   need   to   see   her   all   the   time   as   long   as   i   can   hear   her .   i   did   a   lot   of   research   before   purchasing   and   hands   down   this   is   the   best   monitor   out   there   including   other   less   expensive   summer   monitors   friend   has   one   and   has   had   to   return   hers   3   4   times   .
baby   waterproof   matress   pad   i   love   this   product .   i   recently   had   twins   and   i   use   them   for   every   diaper   change .   its   machine   washable   and   has   been   able   to   withstand   multiple   washes   for   a   few   months   now   with   no   sign   of   damage .   i   have   about   8   10   of   these   and   they   are   great .
piece   of   mind   works   great ,   easy   to   use   but   wish   it   held   under   the   mattress   a   bit   better .
go   anywhere   product   is   excellent   for   a   set   of   twins   or   for   carrying   one   child   and   a   diaper   bag .
great   monitor   so   far ,   so   good   with   this   monitor .   i   ordered   it   to   replace   a   graco   monitor   that   would   not   keep   a   charge .   this   one   has   been   very   reliable   and   i   think   it   looks   cool   lit   up   in   my   son   s   room .
perfect   for   infant   we   started   using   it   when   my   daughter   was   newly   born .   at   first   we   put   a   sponge   foam   on   top   to   give   her   the   soft   support .   not   sure   if   it   s   necessary   though ,   it   s   just   my   idea .   when   she   reached   2   month ,   we   removed   sponge   foam .   now   my   daughter   is   7   month ,   we   re   stil   using   it .   the   size   fits   her   very   well   throughout   the   7   months .   she   seems   very   comfy   sitting   in   there   and   always   has   a   wonderful   time   at   bathing   time .   it   s   also   very   durable ,   easy   to   clean .   after   7   month   s   use ,   it   still   looks   like   new !   my   daughter   is   at   97   height .   from   what   it   looks ,   we   can   continue   using   this   one   until   she   can   sit   in   the   big   real   tub   by   herself !   definitly   a   good   buy !
size   matters !   holds   cold   very   well   for   breast   milk   but   just   not   large   enough .   if   slightly   larger   it   would   be   perfect .
graco   nautilus   3   in1   matrix   good   buy   for   the   price .   keeps   your   little   one   safe   and   secure   while   comfortable .   allows   for   growing   with   the   child ,   with   no   need   to   replace   at   each   stage   of   growth .
this   is   great ! ! ! !   i   love   it ! ! !   when   i   bought   this   chair   i   though   it   was   expensive ,   but   now   that   i   have   use   it   i   love   it ! ! !   is   really   comftrable   and   my   baby   do   not   cry   any   more ...   we   can   go   for   hours   and   he   is   happy   finally   he   is   able   to   move   his   head ,   arms   and   legs   without   any   problem ...   i   strongly   recomend   this   chair   for   any   one ,   my   baby   is   5   months   old   and   this   chair   is   rear   facing   and   front   facing   and   is   fantastic ...
great !   very   soft   and   warm .   i   like   it   very   much   and   use   it   all   the   time   for   my   baby .
great   toy   our   then   13   month   old   son   saw   this   in   the   toy   store   he   refused   to   leave   without   it .   he   and   this   toy   were   inseperable   for   weeks   and   at   eighteen   months   he   still   plays   with   it   daily .   older   children   will   fight   to   play   with   it .   i   was   surprised   how   popular   this   toy   was .   in   the   beginning   he   was   mostly   dragging   it   upside   down   or   on   its   side   and   he   still   loved   it   for   some   reason .   now   he   can   make   the   top   spin   and   it   makes   him   really   happy .
easy   to   assemble   disassemble   i   was   just   a   little   perplexed ,   but   quickly   figured   out   how   to   setup   this   pack   n   play ,   break   it   down   and   move   it   to   another   location   in   the   house .   it   s   very   sturdy   and   useful   with   its   changing   bed ,   and   higher   bed   for   our   daughter   s   newborn .   i   am   older   and   it   s   easier   for   me   with   this   play   yard   to   work   with   my   grandchild   when   babysitting .
this   is   a   cool   little   rack   this   is   a   nice   space   saver   for   the   kitchen   counter .   you   can   put   your   bottles   up   there   after   you   sterilize   and   let   them   finish   drying   out .   i   ve   tried   different   racks   but   i   really   like   this   one .   it   is   plastic   and   the   top   shelf   is   a   little   wobbly   if   you   have   it   at   the   highest   height   setting   and   don   t   have   a   balanced   load .
better   with   a   tablecloth   i   ordered   three   patterns   of   the   crocodile   creek   placemat .   the   pictures   on   the   mat   are   great   and   will   certainly   help   the   learning   process .   the   placemat   itself   was   not   what   i   expected .   i   wanted   a   padded   placemat   that   wouldn   t   move   on   the   table   and   be   easy   to   clean   up   without   having   to   go   through   the   washing   machine .   the   clean   up   is   easy ,   but   the   mats   slide   all   over   our   table .   i   ve   had   to   place   a   cloth   placemat   underneath   the   crocodile   creek   mat   to   keep   it   in   place .   there   is   no   padding   to   the   mat   and   the   coating   which   makes   it   easy   to   clean   makes   it   slick   on   the   table .   while   i   love   the   images ,   if   i   had   realized   the   mats   were   so   thin   and   slick ,   i   would   not   have   ordered   them .
very   fun   this   book   is   a   lot   of   fun ,   and   easy   for   my   6   month   old   to   hold   on   to   himself .   the   only   problem   is   that   it   s   not   easy   to   set   up .   for   the   story   to   make   sense ,   you   have   to   feed   the   caterpillar   through   the   back   of   the   book   so   that   you   can   see   him   each   time   you   turn   the   page .   it   takes   a   few   seconds   to   do ,   and   my   baby   loses   interest   by   the   time   i   have   it   ready .   but   he   s   only   6   months   old ,   so   his   attention   level   isn   t   up   to   speed   yet   anyway .   he   may   like   it   more   later ,   for   now   it   s   mostly   a   teething   toy .
graco   pack   n   play   in   bugs   quilt   wonderful , beautiful   playpen ! !   hard   to   find   square   size   is   perfect   roomy   for   baby   to   play   in ! ! !   very   colorful   well   made ! ! would   definitely   recommend ! ! ! !
good   car   seat   for   the   price   overall   this   is   a   nice   car   seat   for   the   price .   i   really   wanted   a   car   seat   with   the   three   point   harness   instead   of   just   using   the   seat   belt   as   the   restraint   and   this   does   both .   it   was   pretty   easy   to   install ,   but   i   admit   that   my   husband   did   that   and   he   didn   t   complain   about   it   so   i   m   assuming   it   wasn   t   too   much   of   a   pain .   my   main   complaint   with   the   seat   is   that   the   straps   get   twisted   very   easily   and   that   the   buckle   between   the   legs   is   too   short .   my   son   seems   pretty   comfortable   in   it   but   we   ve   never   used   it   for   long   trips .   if   i   had   to   do   over   again ,   i   would   probably   consider   going   with   a   different   car   seat .
excellent   guide   for   the   nursing   mom   i   did   not   prepare   at   all   for   breastfeeding   when   i   got   ready   to   have   my   first   child   in   june   and   suddenly ,   when   she   arrived ,   i   realized   that   to   nurse   effectively ,   it   would   make   sense   to   learn   a   little   bit   about   the   topic !   this   book   was   an   amazing   guide   to   teach   me   about   the   benefits   of   nursing ,   how   to   do   it ,   how   to   attend   to   all   the   challenges   and   how   to   make   the   most   of   it .   nursing   has   been   one   of   the   best   experiences   of   being   a   new   mom   and   this   book   helped   me   to   enjoy   the   experience   beyond   all   expectations .   thorough ,   detailed   and   clear .   highly   recommended !
awesome   night   light   what   a   fun   night   light   for   kids   of   all   ages .   casts   nice   starts   and   the   moon   on   the   ceiling   and   auto   turns   off   during   the   night .   the   buttons   are   big   so   an   older   child   could   turn   back   on   easily   if   he   she   woke   in   the   night .   my   20   month   old   loves   it ,   we   lie   on   the   floor   and   give   it   lots   of   wows   .   plus   its   battery   powered   so   when   you   travel   you   don   t   have   to   worry   about   where   it   can   be   plugged   in .
the   best   portable   high   chair   light   and   easy   to   put   on   the   table   or   take   off   with   one   hand .   small   enough   to   fit   in   the   diaper   bag   and   sturdy   enough   to   hold   my   2   year   old .   be   careful ,   it   does   not   fit   all   tables .   we   have   run   across   problems   with   tables   that   have   a   lip ,   and   sometimes   tables   in   restaurants   are   just   too   thick .   but   this   has   been   only   a   few   times .   prepare   for   a   lot   of   comments !   everyone   walking   by   your   table   will   say   how   cool   they   think   it   is   and   what   a   great   idea .   we   purchased   this   item   in   2004   and   are   still   using   it ,   now   for   our   second   child .   i   have   purchased   one   for   3   of   my   other   friends   who   eat   out   a   lot .   keeps   baby   right   up   at   the   table   with   you .
not   what   i   expected   it   s   a   great   concept   in   all .   the   lavender   is   so   overbearing   that   we   took   out   the   removable   microwavable   sack   that   contained   the   flax   lavender .   we   like   to   soft   material ,   but   with   the   sack   in   place   it   feels   hard .. like   it   has   a   bag   of   dirt .   if   it   had   half   the   amount   it   would   be   much   better .   i   would   give   it   one   star   if   the   sack   was   not   removable   it   s   nice .. squishy   and   soft   and   has   a   nice   light   lavender   sent   without   the   bag .   the   whole   reason   i   bought   it   was   so   my   son   could   have   a   cuddly ,   warm   bunny   for   bed .   maybe   we   ll   open   it   up ,   remove   it   s   contents   and   replace   it   with   just   flax   and   sew   it   back .   the   ears   have   enough   lavender   for   the   aromatherapy   purpose .
doesn   t   work   so   well   the   straps   provided   were   not   wide   enough   to   go   around   our   crib   rail   so   my   husband   put   2   straps   together   to   get   it   to   fit   the   crib   but   my   1   one   year   old   daughter   figured   out   how   to   get   it   off .   this   was   a   waste   of   money .
bouncing   fun !   i   had   this   for   my   second   son   and   he   loved   it ,   and   now   i   am   using   it   for   my   daughter   and   she   is   a   jumping   bean   now !
great   on   planets   where   nights   last   45   minutes !   this   product   is   great   for   parents   who   would   like   their   kids   to   sleep   for   up   to   45   minutes ,   then   wake   up .   those   of   us   who   would   like   them   to   sleep   a   little   longer   wish   that   it   wouldn   t   turn   off   after   45   minutes !   i   have   no   idea   what   they   were   thinking   some   kind   of   ridiculous   liability   issue   br   br   this   makes   the   cute   sheep   useless .   i   d   recommend   getting   a   cheap   radio   and   setting   it   between   am   stations .
love   it !   but   still   learning   how   to   master   no   leaks !   i   love   this   diaper   cover !   transitioning   from   the   plastic   covers   from   walmart   and   having   diaper   rash   all   the   time ,   to   these   fabric   ones   is   just   wow !   my   kids   get   less   diaper   rash   with   these   vs   using   the   disposable   diapers !   i   m   still   learning   how   to   master   no   leaks .   i   know   i   have   heavy   wetters   and   need   to   add   doublers .   it   leaks   out   the   top   front   for   my   7   month   old   who   is   on   her   tummy   a   lot   learning   to   crawl .   but   my   26   month   old   it   leaks   just   a   smiggin   out   the   thigh   if   i   don   t   use   a   doubler !   i   found   that   if   i   use   the   size   i   m   useing   on   my   2   year   old   on   to   my   7   month   old   then   it   works   much   better !   i   found   she   has   a   longer   torso   than   what   the   medium   is   intended   to   fit !   hope   this   helps   but   i   just   love   them !   br   br   they   breath   so   much   better   and   cover   so   much   more !   and   i   use   the   same   cover   all   day   unless   we   have   a   leak .   br   amie
mommy   of   two   girls   this   is   the   perfect   transition   to   a   big   chair .   the   booster   is   very   cozy   hence   the   name   and   does   not   slide   on   our   chairs .
great   for   the   price   we   ve   used   this   car   seat   for   over   a   month   now . our   son   in   14.5   mos   old   presently   average   weight   height   . it   s   a   great   car   seat , very   sturdy   and   the   fabric   is   stitched   well . we   are   currently   using   it   at   maximum   recline   and   our   son   has   absolutely   no   problem   falling   asleep . long   drives   are   not   a   problem   anymore ! i   don   t   know   if   the   fabric   will   work   well   in   the   summers . a   very   good   buy   from   amazon   at   122 . target   and   babies   r   us   have   it   at   150   160   tax .
initially   very   good   but   grows   bad   very   quickly .   i   started   using   this   product   and   was   impressed   with   the   quality .   i   was   able   to   hear   my   baby   very   clearly .   i   liked   that   both   parent   child   units   used   a   battery   backup .   but   2   months   later   things   started   to   fail .   one   child   monitor   went   totally   bad .   the   other   one   still   works   but   the   number   of   places   i   can   use   it   in   the   house   really   is   limited .   if   i   place   the   monitor   in   a   place   outside   a   select   few   then   i   hear   a   lot   of   static .   i   would   not   recommend   this   monitor .
my   son   like   this   toy   but   i   have   one   complaint ....   it   s   listed   on   amazon   under   a   third   party   seller   who   charges   almost   10   in   shipping .   the   toy   itself   was   4 ......
an   instant   party   for   smaller   people .   i   have   a   2   month   old   who   thinks   this   thing   is   an   absolute   party   out   of   bounds .   she   stares ,   completely   transfixed ... then   she   cracks   up .   then   she   stares   some   more ,   smiling   all   the   while .   then   she   cracks   up .   repeat   until   the   15   minute   timer   runs   out .   the   music   is   quite   good ,   though   the   sound   quality   is   not   stellar .   the   design   of   the   animals   themselves   and   the   movements   they   make   are   what   make   this   toy   so   good .   would   recommend .
great   picture   book   for   toddlers   little   hands   i   bought   this   book   for   use   at   our   house   when   our   little   10   month   old   great   granddaughter   comes   over   for   a   visit .   i   have   pictures   of   her   with   her   dad   and   mom   and   our   two   pet   dogs .   she   loves   the   photo   book   and   carries   it   around   with   her .   it   is   just   the   right   size .   i   like   it   because   the   pictures   don   t   come   out   easily   and   the   book   wipes   off   to   look   good   as   new
great   humidifier   this   is   a   great   little   humidifier .   the   controls   are   simple   and   intuitive .   i   love   that   the   water   tray   is   dishwasher   safe   so   i   can   easily   clean   and   sanitize   it .   yes ,   you   have   to   replace   the   filters   just   like   any   evaporative   humidifier   but   they   are   inexpensive   and   easy   to   replace   amazon   has   them   for   9.99   .   the   capacity   or   the   water   tank   is   just   right   small   enough   to   fill   easily ,   but   large   enough   that   you   don   t   have   to   constantly   refill   it .   we   bought   this   intending   to   use   it   in   the   baby   s   room ,   but   ended   up   using   it   in   our   room   to   replace   a   much   more   expensive   ultrasonic   humidifier   that   was   impossible   to   clean   and   much   less   effective .   i   plan   on   buying   another   one   for   my   son   s   room .
amazing   product ,   very   well   made   i   have   a   5   month   old   and   this   is   a   big   wow   at   our   house .   my   daughter   is   fascinated   by   the   pink   color   and   it   is   so   much   easier   to   feed   as   only   the   right   amount   of   food   is   dispensed   each   time   you   squeeze .   i   have   noticed   that   it   is   lot   less   messy   than   the   traditional   way .   i   only   wish   i   had   this   product   with   my   first   child   of   5   years .   the   one   that   i   got   had   the   label   bpa   free

great   buy   i   m   very   directionally   challenged ,   so   it   probably   took   me   a   little   longer   than   most   to   put   this   together .   however ,   once   i   got   the   hang   of   it   and   actually   paid   attention   to   what   the   directions   said ... things   moved   along   quite   fast .   it   s   very   sturdy ,   and   the   changing   table   is   removeable ,   so   my   son   will   be   able   to   keep   this   for   a   while .   the   entire   unit   is   much   larger   than   i   expected ,   which   was   a   plus ,   and   it   is   the   same   height   as   the   matching   crib ,   which   really   pulls   the   whole   room   together   if   you   re   as   anal   as   i   am  
diaper   pail   liner   my   wife   and   i   decided   to   use   cloth   diapers .   we   put   all   our   dirty   cloth   diapers   in   this   pail   liner   each   day .   we   have   two   of   these   bags   and   a   few   other   brands   that   have   failed   in   one   way   or   another .   each   day   once   a   day   i   flip   the   bag   contents   into   the   washer   and   the   bag   inside   out .   this   brand   of   bags   has   better   stiching   than   others   that   came   apart   after   a   month   or   so .   better   quality   makes   a   big   difference   when   you   wash   something   every   day .   also   the   bag   matterial   itsself   holds   up   well   compaired   to   the   lesser   bags .
great   bottle ,   cheaper   at   babies   r   us   this   is   a   great   bottle .   i   got   it   for   my   5   month   old   daughter   who   s   not   yet   ready   for   a   sippy   cup ,   but   wants   to   hold   the   bottle   herself .   she   can   easily   grab   the   handles   and   enjoys   playing   at   feeding   herself   even   getting   the   nipple   in   her   mouth   most   of   the   time .   the   bottle   does   not   leak   as   long   as   you   get   it   together   properly .   the   nipple   and   the   handles   have   tabs   slots   that   need   to   be   aligned .   not   hard   to   do   though .   the   only   down   side   to   this   bottle   is   after   i   ordered   it   online ,   i   found   the   same   bottles   at   babies   r   us   for   half   the   price .
great   mat   i   bought   this   mat   for   my   son   s   playroom .   he   loves   looking   at   the   bright   colors   and   learning   the   letters   and   numbers .   it   is   easy   to   assemble   and   good   quality .
great   cover !   this   cover   has   been   awesome !   it   has   contained   every   mess .   after   almost   5   months ,   we   re   just   having   to   order   the   next   size   up   for   my   daughter .
good   quality   entertainment   for   babies   from   0   to   6   months   had   one   with   my   first .   she   loved   it .   was   given   another   for   my   second   and   she   loves   it   too .   a   few   weeks   ago   we   witnessed   that   magical   moment   when   our   baby   reached   out ,   concentrating ,   struggling   hard   and   touched   the   toys   for   the   first   time .   my   second   is   now   at   2   months   and   loves   to   either   bat   or   kick   at   the   toys .   she   loves   that   mirror .   she   loves   the   monkey   he   is   the   best   one   and   she   loves   the   crunchy   parrot .   even   the   music   is   decent .   recommend .
loved   it !   i   bought   the   rise   and   shine   grace   pack   n   play .   it   looks   even   better   than   i   thought .   my   teenage   daughter   had   it   put   together   in   about   1   minute .   and   most   important   my   granddaughter   sleeps   well   in   it .   great   buy   also .
best   paci   ever ,   especially   for   colicky   babies !   my   second   daughter   would   not   take   the   avent   pacifiers   that   my   first   daughter   liked   so   much .   she   was   very   colicky   and   this   was   the   only   pacifier   that   would   soothe   her .   i   highly   recommend   it ,   just   check   them   often   when   your   children   start   getting   teeth ,   as   they   might   chew   on   the   pacifier   and   the   nipple   could   be   chewed   off .   still   worth   buying   many   of   them ! ! ! !
great   product   this   is   a   great   rocker .   our   first   daughter   loved   it   and   our   2nd   one   is   about   to   grow   out   of   it   so   it   s   sturdy   and   well   built .   it   s   easy   to   clean   too .   the   vibrations   amused   the   first   baby   but   not   so   much   with   the   2nd   one ,   so   mileage   may   vary .   i   only   wished   it   had   a   bit   more   padding   along   the   top   rim ,   it   s   kinda   hard   and   it   can   hurt   when   bumped   into .
this   thing   is   a   friggin   lifesaver .   our   daughter   is   now   almost   2   and   a   half   and   we   still   use   this   every   day .   when   she   was   tiny ,   it   saved   us   so   much   worry   and   headache ,   as   we   could   see   what   she   was   doing   we   hung   it   closer   to   her   crib   lower   on   the   wall   and   i   could   actually   see   her   little   chest   moving   up   and   down   when   she   was   sleeping .   it   even   enabled   me   to   shower   i   could   pop   into   the   shower ,   and   if   i   thought   i   heard   something ,   i   could   pop   out   of   the   shower   and   get   a   quick   visual .   as   she   s   gotten   older ,   we   ve   moved   it   up   higher   on   the   wall ,   and   now   it   s   almost   at   the   ceiling ,   but   i   can   still   get   a   pretty   clear   view .   i   cannot   recommend   this   product   enough .   it   is   totally ,   totally   worth   the   money .   hopefully   summer   infant   will   come   out   with   a   long   range   teenager   monitor   too !  
we   love   wubbanub !   we   ve   had   wubbanubs   since   our   son   was   3   months   old ,   he   s   8   months   now   and   he   loves   them .   the   attached   toys   make   the   pacifiers   easy   to   find   and   hold   onto   for   us   and   for   our   baby .   we   like   to   keep   one   handy   wherever   we   go   at   home   in   the   nursery   or   play   area ,   in   the   car ,   in   the   diaper   bag ,   and   for   daycare .   if   your   baby   uses   soothie   pacifiers ,   this   is   an   excellent   addition   to   your   baby   gear !   also   a   plus ,   wubbanub   makes   the   red   dog   and   yellow   duck   plush   toys   attached   to   a   lovie   type   blankie   so   when   your   ready   to   be   rid   of   the   pacifier ,   you   can   substitute   the   blankie   and   not   take   away   your   baby   s   favorite   cuddle   toys .   i   recommend   this   product   to   all   new   parents .
dog   wubbanub   my   son   loves   the   wubbanubs   the   only   thing   i   didnt   like   about   the   dog   is   that   it   didnt   have   the   beanbag   feet   like   the   horse   did
cute ,   but   not   effective   i   had   such   high   hopes   for   this   product .   the   concept   is   great   and   i   desperately   needed   something   to   help   my   newborn   keep   a   pacifer   in   her   mouth .   but ,   alas ,   this   was   not   the   product .   while   cute ,   it   didn   t   have   enough   weight   to   do   the   job .   it   popped   out   of   her   mouth   as   often   as   a   normal   pacifier .   it   is   now   sitting   in   a   drawer   somewhere .
the   only   pacifier   my   baby   will   use   my   exclusively   breastfed   5   month   old   has   used   only   this   pacifier   since   6   weeks   old .   she   refuses   all   other   pacifiers ,   but   loves   the   gumdrop .   i   love   the   design   with   the   cut   out   for   the   nose   and   all   one   piece .   it   is   also   soft   enough   that   if   it   gets   lost   in   the   bed   or   carseat   it   is   not   super   uncomfortable   or   hard .   it   is   funny   looking ,   and   slightly   odd   to   see   all   the   way   into   a   child   s   mouth ,   but   overall   we   love   the   product   and   recommend   it   to   others .
all   i   know ...   all   i   know   is   that   both   of   my   daughters   they   are   17   months   apart   love   these   pacis .... for   some   reason ,   they   like   the   newborn   ones ,   even   though   my   oldest   is   two .   they   really   are   pacifiers !
excellent   everything   updated   11.26 . 09   almost   everything   updated   review   11.26 . 09 .   we   had   almost   two   great   years   with   this   product   and   used   it   heavily .   but   the   battery   life   is   shorter   and   the   static   has   gotten   so   bad   we   can   t   use   it   anymore .   this   seems   to   be   somewhat   common ,   and   i   am   disappointed   there   isnt   a   reasonably   priced   option   for   us   to   update   our   monitor .   camera   still   great   .   warranty   is   only   good   for   a   year ,   and   this   problem   often   doesnt   occur   until   after   a   year ,   funny   how   that   goes .   if   we   want   to   replace   it ,   we   pay   to   return   monitor   and   an   additional   104   for   a   refurbished   unit .   bummer ....   we   did   a   ton   of   research   before   buying   this   product   a   year   ago .   my   daughter   has   just   turned   one   and   i   still   love   it   as   much   as   i   ever   did .   quality   is   great ,   reliability   great ,   very   easy   to   pack   up   and   move   if   you   want   to   bring   it   on   overnight   trips .   the   price   is   the   price   because   its   a   great   product ,   simple   as   that .   the   only   negative   i   have   read   here   that   i   ll   agree   with   is   that   the   color   quality   isnt   that   great .   but   i   worry   about   anybody   who   needs   to   see   their   baby   in   color .   buy   this ,   you   wont   regret   it .
resolve   the   one   problem   this   way .   placement   is   the   issue .   the   solution   is   to   hang   the   turtle   from   fishing   string   or   another   fine ,   strong   string   and   use   the   turtle   like   a   mobile .   the   images   are   perfect ,   and   center   room   placement   is   no   longer   a   problem .
excellent   toy ! !   i   am   very   impressed   w   this   toy .   my   5   month   old   son   is   absolutely   enthralled   w   it   and   he   s   had   it   for   2   months   now .   he   will   play   in   it   for   longer   than   anything   else   we   have .   he   lays   in   it   and   looks   up   at   the   toys   and   the   scenery   on   top .   then ,   when   he   gets   bored ,   he   rolls   over   and   plays   with   the   stuff   on   the   bottom .   great   entertainer ! !
good   the   only   thing   i   don   t   like   is   that   if   your   lmp   isn   t   on   sunday ,   it   kind   of   messes   with   you .   also   don   t   like   how   when   you   are   10   wks   1   day   it   shows   you   at   11   wks .   i   understand   now ,   but   was   very   confused   at   first .   all   in   all   its   good .
does   just   what   i   needed   this   item   works   great .   it   s   thick   and   strong   and   really   helps   to   protect   the   seats   from   indents   of   the   car   seat   along   with   food   and   moisture .   it   stays   put   too ,   no   slipping .   i   like   the   extra   lil   pockets   for   storage .   i   would   recommend !
great   carrier   great   carrier   better   that   tne   bjorn   and   cheaper   too !   i   ve   tried   a   few   and   i   like   this   the   best .   everyone   uses   this   carrier   the   most   in   my   family   and   nanay   too   becasue   my   daughter   loves   to   face   forward .   carrier   is   great   for   back   facing   too ,   so   my   daughter   can   fall   asleep   facing   me .   this   is   the   best   baby   carrier   from   a   dad   s   perspective .
great   product   but   outrageous   shipping !   these   are   great   so   i   was   going   to   buy   more ,   until   my   cart   showed   a   31   shipping   fee   for   two   of   them .   are   you   kidding   me   !   i   ll   find   them   in   a   store .
stroller   for   two   i   have   had   my   joovy   caboose   ultralight   for   almost   a   month   and   love   it .   it   is   light   weight   and   easy   to   fold   and   unfold .   i   have   a   3   year   old   and   a   newborn ,   this   stroller   fit   my   needs   perfect   because   my   3   year   old   doesn   t   like   to   always   ride   in   a   stroller ,   yet   she   gets   tired   of   walking .   the   stand   part   of   the   stroller   is   perfect   for   her ,   she   can   even   sit   down   on   the   little   bench   if   she   wants   too .   the   only   problem   i   ve   encountered   so   far   is   that   when   using   with   an   infant   seat   the   older   child   does   not   have   a   lot   of   room   to   sit .   however ,   that   seems   to   bother   me   more   than   my   3   year   old .   i   have   a   peg   perego   infant   seat   and   it   s   fabulous   that   the   joovy   caboose   compatible   with   that   seat .   i   wish   there   was   more   storage ,   but   i   new   before   buying   that   storage   was   limited   and   made   adjustments .   i   bought   the   j . j .   kole   diaper   bag   system   that   hangs   on   the   handle   works   fabulous   .   i   also   bought   the   parent   tray   for   the   joovy   caboose   and   that   holds   everything   i   need   at   arms   length   .   .   .   bottled   water ,   keys ,   bottle ,   pacifier ,   phone   .   .   .   i   am   very   satisfied   with   the   stroller   and   would   advise   anyone   looking   at   double   strollers   to   consider   this .   especially   if   you   have   a   toddler   like   mine   who   doesn   t   want   to   just   sit   in   a   stroller   all   the   time .
sippy   cup   i   bought   this   cup   for   my   daughter   but   it   in   less   than   a   week   it   started   leaking ...   very   disapointing ...
was   hoping   it   would   be   better   i   bought   every   type   of   pacifier   at   babiesrus   to   see   which   my   son   would   like ,   i   really   liked   how   these   pacifiers   looked .   however   at   0   months   is   teething   element   really   needed   this   is   one   of   my   sons   least   favourite   pacifier ,   i   m   not   sure   what   he   doesn   t   like   about   it ,   but   he   really   hates   it .   it   s   a   shame   because   i   like   the   consept   but   it   just   wasn   t   for   us .
horrible   walker   i   baught   this   walker   at   my   local   walmart ,   because   my   son   was   getting   bored   with   his   jumperoo .   the   trays   dont   stay   attatched ,   his   seat   is   always   coming   undone ,   and   he   can   pull   the   toys   out   and   throw   them   across   the   floor .   i   don   t   recomend   this   to   anyone !
a   pretty   good   monitor   for   price   were   r   pleased .   i   is   nice   and   small   and   has   good   range .   excellent   for   price   paid .   the   only   thing   that   we   noticed   is   that   there   is   occasional   static ,   but   not   as   bad   as   the   others   we   have   had .
good   value   for   price   plus   extra   packing   room ! !   i   decided   i   needed   a   bag   so   we   could   check   our   our   stroller   when   flying .   we   have   a   maclaren   quest .   maclaren   sells   their   own   bag   for   a   bit   more   money ,   so   i   decided   to   try   this .   it   worked   perfectly .   we   have   used   it   for   both   domestic   and   international   travel   and   it   has   held   up   well   so   far .   the   quest   fits   in   it   with   room   to   spare ,   so   we   are   even   able   to   throw   toys   and   shoes   in   there   to   reduce   some   of   the   weight   in   our   other   bags   baby   items   like   strollers   and   playpens   don   t   count   against   you   as   pieces   of   baggage   defintely   helpful   in   these   days   of   airlines   charging   for   extra   bags !   br   br   we   haven   t   taken   it   through   security   with   us   so   i   can   t   comment   on   how   easy   or   not   easy   it   is   to   maneuver   we   generally   have   our   car   seat   with   us   and   just   roll   our   son   through   the   airport   in   that ,   so   we   don   t   need   the   stroller   until   we   get   to   our   destination   .
loses   suction .... not   worth   the   money   i   bought   this   pump   and   at   first   it   worked   great .   then   it   started   to   lose   suction .   i   researched   and   found   out   that   this   was   a   problem   that   the   company   knows   about .   i   called   and   they   said   they   couldn   t   help   me   since   i   wasn   t   the   original   owner   and   besides   all   pumps   lose   suction .   not   worth   the   money !
great   to   do   business   with   this   is   my   second   klean   kanteen   from   healthegoods .   i   had   an   issue   with   the   first   on   the   sport   top   breaking   off   and   they   replaced   it   no   problem .   i   bought   this   smaller   one   for   my   son   and   he   loves   it !   i   recommended   them   to   my   mom   friends   at   work !   thanks .

my   newborn   son   loves   his   gumdrops !   i   was   given   one   by   the   hospital   when   my   son   was   born   and   he   loves   it .   i   bought   one   more   at   the   hospital   s   baby   boutique   and   ordered   5   more   online .   gumdrops   really   are   the   best   pacifiers   i   have   found .   my   son   will   not   take   any   other   kind   of   pacifier .   he   has   to   have   his   gumdrop .   i   really   wish   i   had   these   when   my   first   three   where   little .   i   couldn   t   get   them   to   take   a   pacifier   at   all .
great   pacifier   for   newborn   4months   my   aunt   sent   me   one   of   these   when   my   son   was   born   and   he   loved   them   so   much   i   ended   up   ordering   more ,   and   giving   some   as   baby   shower   gifts .   all   the   mommies   i   know   who   have   used   them ,   loved   them .   they   stay   in   the   mouth   a   lot   better   than   regular   pacifiers   and   are   a   lot   more   comfortable !   it   was   also   a   lot   easier   on   me   breastfeeding   him   because   the   nipple   is   similar   to   a   real   one .   with   regular   pacifiers   i   found   that   they   were   always   falling   out .. not   this   one !   i   highly   recommend   this   product   for   newborns   and   up !
sorry ,   guy .   when   my   boy   looks   back   on   his   baby   photos   a   few   decades   from   now ,   he   s   probably   going   to   think   his   father   was   a   weirdo .   that   s   ok .   who   knows ,   maybe   he   ll   get   a   laugh   out   of   them   certainly   a   lot   of   other   people   do .   hmmmm .   i   wonder   what   the   kid   thinks   when   people   look   into   the   carriage   and   laugh   at   him   when   does   he   develop   his   sensitivities   anyway   i   guess   i   better   not   use   these   things   overly   long .   in   any   case ,   i   ve   noticed   various   versions   of   these   billy   bob   teeth ,   and   i   just   had   to   try   them   out .   sorry ,   guy .   br   br   gary   peterson
easy   way   to   order   and   keep   on   hand   the   infant   soothie   pacifier   is   the   only   pacifier   my   lo   has   taken   to   since   she   first   had   one   in   the   hospital .   they   are   safe   and   are   all   one   piece .   solid   and   sturdy .   much   easier   to   buy   online   than   to   hunt   down   in   stores   highly   recommend .
love   it   was   given   one   of   these   at   hospital   baby   will   take   no   other   kind ,   was   very   happy   to   find   these   at   a   great   price .
great   product !   my   daughter   has   used   soothie   pacifiers   since   she   was   about   a   week   old .   now   that   she   s   in   the   chewing   stage   about   6   mo   ,   we   got   this   one   for   daytime   use .   she   loves   it !   it   looks   funny   when   she   sucks   on   it   because   it   s   so   big ,   but   she   doesn   t   seem   to   mind .
steve   au   this   pacifier   was   the   best   part   of   my   son   s   halloween   costume .   we   got   so   many   compliments   on   it .   it   is   so   much   easier   than   putting   a   baby   in   a   goofy   costume   they   don   t   want   to   be   in .
super   soothie   blue   pacifier   the   blue   super   soothie   pacifier   looks   like   the   ordinary   green   ones   but   is   made   of   thicker   material .   it   works   wonderfully   for   older   children .   my   19   mos   old   son   is   teething   and   chews   on   his   hands   constantly .   he   won   t   use   teething   toys   but   he   chews   the   edge   of   the   pacifier .   he   could   bite   through   the   green   ones   but   the   blue   one   is   thick   enough   he   cannot   bite   through .
haba   pacifier   chains   i   am   very   excited   to   have   found   these   products .   my   mother   gave   me   a   couple   of   these   8   years   ago   when   i   had   my   first   baby   and   she   had   gotten   them   in   germany .   there   wasn   t   anywhere   here   that   sold   anything   like   that   back   then ,   and   i   received   so   many   compliments   on   them .   i   can   t   wait   to   hear   the   same   things   again   when   people   see   the   new   ones !
best   pacifier   ever ! !   my   baby   s   nurse   recommended   this   pacifier   when   he   was   in   the   nicu .   he   is   14   months   and   still   loves   to   carry   it   around .   i   was   worried   because   the   soothie   pacifier   can   t   be   detached   but   these   have   lasted   14   months   and   i   throw   them   in   the   washer   drier   and   they   come   out   like   new .   they   claim   to   be   for   up   to   age   3   6   months   but   they   are   actually   quite   durable .   soothie   makes   pacifiers   for   older   kids   but   not   in   a   wubbanub .   we   get   these   for   gifts   for   anyone   we   know   is   having   a   baby .   because   they   are   attached   and   weighted   down   like   a   beanie   baby   they   are   great   for   young   babies   who   can   t   hold   a   pacifier   by   themselves .   it   ll   save   you   from   having   to   constantly   have   to   put   the   pacifier   back   in   their   mouth .   i   love   this   product ! !
watch   out   for   mold !   i   gave   this   paci   to   my   daughter   when   she   was   only   a   couple   weeks   old   and   she   really   liked   it .   i   was   breastfeeding   and   liked   the   idea   that   it   was   like   mother .   the   problem   with   this   paci   is   that   where   the   soft   latex   and   hard   plastic   meets   there   is   a   seam   that   saliva   can   get   into .   over   time   it   gets   funky   in   there   and   mold   can   grow .   unfortunately ,   you   can   t   take   apart   the   binky   in   order   to   clean   it .   even   boiling   them   didn   t   work .   i   did   end   up   using   these   until   my   daughter   was   1 .   i   just   watched   them   and   threw   them   out   when   they   started   to   get   weird .   so   if   you   don   t   mind   cycling   through   binkies   every   few   months   then   give   these   a   try ...
i   beg   to   differ   disappointed   with   the   gerber   paci ,   i   bought   this   one   after   seeing   the   rave   reviews   from   others ,   i   was   disappointed .   it   is   not   an   expensive   product   but   the   shipping   cost   was   more   than   the   items   for   me   that   was   ok   as   long   as   the   paci   lived   up   to   it   reputation   but   it   did   not .   it   kept   slipping   out   of   my   daughter   s   mouth   which   is   average   size   for   a   two   month   old   perhaps   it   is   the   unimaginative   design .   the   big   suction   hole   in   the   front   of   the   pacifier   is   unattractive   as   well   it   looks   like   the   paci   is   missing   a   plug   or   something .   moreover ,   it   made   me   a   little   nervous   as   she   always   seem   to   be   struggling   to   breathe   as   she   tried   keep   it   from   slipping   out   of   her   mouth .   i   am   trying   the   avent ,   stay   tuned   for   that   review .
wubbies   are   a   wonder   we   used   the   wubbanub   with   our   baby   and   she   love   s   them .   they   are   easy   for   her   to   find   at   night   on   her   own   as   the   plush   makes   them   easy   to   grab .   so   we   bought   them   for   a   family   member   for   their   soon   to   arrive   baby   girl .
for   babies   who   prefer   the   breast   my   daughter   wanted   to   constantly   use   me   as   her   pacifier   and   i   tried   every   pacifier   in   the   store   but   she   wouldn   t   latch   on   to   any   of   them   for   more   than   a   few   seconds .   i   read   the   reviews   and   decided   to   order   a   few   of   these   so   that   maybe   i   could   get   a   few   hours   of   sleep   instead   of   having   her   nurse   off   me   all   night .   they   worked   wonders !   these   are   the   only   pacifiers   she   will   use .   they   are   lightweight ,   which   is   great   b   c   they   re   less   likely   to   wake   her   up   by   falling   out   of   her   mouth   once   she   s   asleep .   plus   they   are   very   bendable   so   if   she   is   asleep   on   her   side   they   won   t   put   too   much   pressure   on   her   little   face .   thanks   hawaii   medical !

love   it   all   the   babies   in   our   area   receive   this   pacifier   at   the   local   hospital   when   they   are   born .   my   daughter   loves   it .   in   fact   she   only   likes   this   pacifier   and   we   have   tried   others .   i   would   recommended   this   paci   to   all !   the   funny   looking   pacifiers   are   loved   by   all   the   babies   i   know .
incredible ! ! ! !   i   have   two   sons   and   took   the   heartbeat   bear   to   hospital   to   soothe   each   of   them   from   birth .   they   are   now   6   and   12   years   old   and   still   fall   asleep   within   minutes   of   hearing   the   soothing   heartbeat   sound .
soothie   pacifiers   order   was   filled   quickly ,   shipping   was   reasonable ,   and   we   got   a   free   sample   pacie .   all   around   a   great   experience .   i   would   definately   do   business   with   this   merchant   again .
too   cute !   niece   loves   it !   she   carries   it   everywhere !   she   may   be   too   old   for   pacifiers   soon   but   she   seems   to   not   even   bother   with   the   pacifier   as   much   as   she   enjoys   the   animal .   it   seems   as   the   animal   has   her   security   pacifier   so   she   is   transferring   her   security   to   the   animal .   who   knows   she   loves   it !
my   son   loves   his   horse   paci !   my   son   was   given   soothie   pacifierss   in   the   hospital ,   and   we   continued   with   them   when   we   got   home .   we   got   our   first   wubbanub   at   3   months ,   and   have   not   used   anything   else   since .   we   have   about   4   or   5   at   any   time ,   and   have   lost   sveral   at   wal   mart ,   or   to   a   chewing   puppy   dog .   we   just   keep   replacing   them ,   and   my   son   is   happy .   he   just   turned   one ,   and   now   he   chews   on   the   legs   more   than   he   sucks   on   the   paci .   i   wouldn   t   trade   these   for   anything !
great   idea   these   are   the   cutest   things ,   very   good   for   a   unique   baby   gift .   i   got   3 ,   two   for   friends   of   mine   that   are   expecting   and   one   for   my   2   month   old .   he   loves   it .
awsome   she   loves   it ,   this   is   the   pacifier   that   stays   in   her   crib   because   she   only   sleeps   with   this   one
love   it !   i   bought   the   wubbanub   for   my   4   week   old   son   because   he   could   not   keep   his   paci   in   at   night .   the   wubbanub   would   still   fall   out   if   he   didn   t   suck   constantly   but   it   was   much   better   than   before .   it   is   lightweight   but   i   think   the   reason   is   so   it   will   fall   out   if   he   spits   up .   now   at   7   weeks   it   stays   in   his   mouth   better   and   he   wraps   his   hands   around   it   so   cute .   this   is   definitely   a   great   solution   for   anyone   tempted   to   prop   the   pacifier .   i   bought   1   for   my   in   utero   niece .
sanity   saver   we   got   this   as   a   shower   gift   and   i   thought   it   was   reeeeally   creepy .   until   i   saw   how   quickly   my   daughter   fell   asleep   when   i   turned   it   on .   she   s   nearly   2   now   and   still   loves   this   bear .   once   they   outgrow   the   need   for   the   sound ,   you   can   take   out   the   sound   pack   and   its   just   a   regular   cozy   bear .
not   for   a   baby   that   chews   this   pacifier   chain   is   great   looking ,   but   it   does   not   hold   up   to   lots   of   chewing   sucking .   my   son   is   4   1   2   months   old   and   puts   everything   in   his   mouth .   i   checked   on   the   chain   after   he   chewed   on   it   for   a   while   and   noticed   that   2   beads   were   cracked !   i   ended   up   having   to   throw   it   out   since   i   was   afraid   the   beads   would   break   and   become   a   choking   hazard .
a   soother   and   a   toy   in   one !   at   first ,   the   duck   helped   keep   the   pacifier   in   our   son   s   mouth ,   but   as   he   got   older ,   it   provided   hours   of   entertainment   as   well .   also ,   he   does   not   lose   it   in   his   crib .
fantastic   videoid   24606481   a   two   sided   review
good   quality   but   beware ...   this   is   a   great   monitor ,   we   bought   it   to   monitor   our   first   baby   and   the   video   audio   quality   is   excellent ..   it   even   works   with   good   reception   between   multi   floor   house   and   even   from   outside   the   house .   the   only   thing   that   i   would   say   is   pretty   badly   designed   is   the   fact   that   if   your   next   door   neighbor   has   the   same   unit   the   signal   from   his   unit   would   show   up   on   your   monitor   and   you   d   be   looking   at   his   kids   and   vice   versa ..   i   think   this   is   a   bad   design   and   security   risk   and   should   be   corrected .
a   nice   idea   i   love   the   idea   of   this   bag ,   but   the   zipper   on   it   would   scratch   me   every   time   i   tried   to   get   something   in   or   out   of   the   bag .   other   than   the   zipper   it   is   a   good   bag   i   meant   to   give   it   3   stars ,   but   for   some   reason   i   can   t   edit   that   .
front   wheel   design   flaw   there   was   much   that   i   initially   liked   about   this   stroller .   it   has   a   nice   overall   design ,   and   it   s   a   good   size .   however ,   there   appears   to   be   a   major   design   flaw   in   the   front   wheels ,   and   they   lock   up   continuously .   initially   it   only   happened   on   somewhat   rough   surfaces ,   but   now   it   s   constant .   we   ve   reached   a   point ,   after   only   about   7   months   of   use ,   that   we   have   to   get   a   different   stroller ,   because   it   won   t   go   for   more   than   a   few   feet   without   the   front   wheels   locking   up ,   unless   we   re   on   a   perfectly   smooth   surface .   i   ve   noticed   that   most   strollers   have   double   front   wheels   on   each   side ,   and   i   regret   not   having   taken   note   of   this   before   i   bought   this   stroller .   the   apparatus   that   holds   the   wheels   in   place   is   just   a   snap   on   part ,   that   wobbles   easily ,   and   that   also   appears   to   add   to   the   problem   with   the   wheels .   there   is   also   little   back   support ,   so   my   daughter   tends   to   slouch   in   this   stroller .   the   back   is   held   in   an   upright   position   by   a   strap   that   is   adjustable ,   but   since   the   back   is   made   of   what   seems   to   be   corrugated   plastic ,   it   bows ,   and   between   that   and   the   strap ,   it   stays   in   a   somewhat   reclined   position   rather   than   solidly   upright .
great   stroller   for   the   price !   i   have   been   very   impressed   with   this   stroller   so   far .   it   arrived   quickly   and   did   not   require   much   assembly .   it   rolls   smoothly ,   turns   easily ,   and   being   tall   i   am   a   big   fan   of   the   adjustable   handlebar !   my   8   month   old   seems   very   comfortable   in   this   stroller .   she   loves   to   sit   up   and   see   what   is   going   on   most   of   the   time ,   but   it   is   extremely   easy   to   recline   the   seat   if   she   is   sleepy   and   needs   to   nap .   i   also   appreciate   the   way   the   sunshade   can   be   pulled   down   to   keep   her   out   of   the   sun .   this   was   a   big   factor   for   me   living   in   arizona .   other   things   i   have   been   pleased   with   are   the   large   storage   basket   and   truly   one   step ,   one   handed   folding .   i   think   this   stroller   is   a   great   buy   and   i   would   recommend   it   to   anyone !
i   love   it   out   of   the   swing ,   the   play   mat   and   this ,   my   daughter   sits   for   the   longest   in   this   before   she   starts   to   gripe   to   be   picked   up .   and   for   a   baby   that   usually   wants   to   be   held   all   the   time ,   i   don   t   what   i   d   do   without   it .   before   i   got   this ,   she   would   just   cry   the   whole   time   i   would   try   to   eat   and   feed   my   son .   now   she   just   sits   there   content   while   i   can   get   something   done .   and   i   don   t   think   the   vibrating   is   too   hard   like   some   other   people   said ,   when   i   put   her   in   it   without   it   on   and   then   turn   it   on ,   she   smiles   really   big .   i   also   don   t   see   a   problem   in   how   deep   the   seat   is   or   the   cushion .   and   i   would   prefer   this   over   one   that   is   more   stimulating ,   babies   can   get   over   stimulated .   i   think   this   one   is   just   right   to   keep   her   occupied .   she   loves   to   sit   there   and   look   at   the   butterflies .   and   i   also   don   t   take   the   toy   bar   off   just   to   put   her   in   and   out ,   i   just   make   sure   i   hold   her   low   enough   and   a   little   to   the   side   while   passing   under   it   so   they   don   t   hit   her   face .
worst   i   have   ever   used   i   bought   this   bassinet   for   my   first   child   and   it   broke   within   a   month !   it   is   not   sturdy   and   is   made   of   plastic   and   cardboard ,   do   not   buy   this   product .   it   is   also   almost   2   times   more   expensive   then   other   bassinets   i   have   seen   that   would   be   sturdier .
mandatory   if   you   mix   formula ,   you   have   to   get   one   of   these .   it   makes   it   so   easy !
the   best   i   ve   found   and   i   ve   tried   a   lot !   i   bought   these   bowls   after   trying   about   5   other   kinds   of   stay   put   suction   bowls .   these   are   the   only   ones   that   have   actually   stayed   put   on   his   high   chair ,   the   table ,   and   even   restaurant   tables !   we   went   out   and   bought   another   pack ,   so   we   now   have   6 .   my   1   year   old   pulls   and   pulls   and   pulls   on   these ,   but   cannot   break   the   suction   a   great   deal   for   the   money !
playtex   sportster   cup   replacement   straws   asin   b000v6yi6a   playtex   baby   straw   cup   replacement   short   straws   6   pack   excellent   product .   straw   replacements   were   a   life   saver   to   me .   i   didn   t   want   to   buy   new   cups ,   but   i   had   lost   a   few   straws   and   my   kids   had   chewed   up   a   few ,   so   this   was   the   perfect   solution .   highly   recommend .
very   useful   i   will   recommend   this   for   every   breast   feed   parents .   it   is   very   easy   to   feed   the   baby .
secure   but   comfortable   the   sleepy   wrap   is   far   more   breathable   and   comfortable   than   most   other   baby   carriers .   the   generous   amount   of   stretchy   fabric   that   envelops   the   baby   gives   boths   the   wearer   and   the   baby   more   of   a   feeling   of   security .   the   sleepy   wrap   shapes   to   the   baby   s   position ,   rather   than   the   other   way   around .   it   s   just   a   stylish ,   east   to   wear ,   comfy   baby   carrier   !
buyer   beware ! ! ! ! !   don   t   buy   this   item   supplied   target !   they   are   shipping   2   spouts ,   instead   of   the   4   spouts   they   are   advertising .   and ,   they   are   charging   the   4   spout   price   2   spouts   are   6.99   .   amazon   apologized   for   the   mistake ,   but   since   target   supplies   the   spouts ,   there   is   nothing   amazon   can   do .   however ,   amazon   was   very   apologetic   and   they   are   refunding   my   money   as   well   as   paying   for   the   return   shipping .
very   cute ! !   very   cute   swim   trunks !   this   is   only   for   the   swim   trunks .   it   does   not   come   with   the   matching   rashguard   shown .   my   mistake   i   didn   t   read   it   was   only   for   the   swim   trunks .   overall   too   cute !   i   bought   this   for   my   son   for   next   swim   season   09 .
all   my   kids   love   this   stroller   i   have   3   kids   5 ,   2   and   4   months   old   .   my   5   and   2   years   old   love   this   stroller .   the   reason   i   give   it   4   stars   is   because   it   is   not   very   roomy .   if   the   manufacture   make   this   stroller   a   little   more   room ,   then   it   will   get   5   stars   for   sure .
when   breast   and   formula   feeding   great   we   ve   been   doing   both   breast   and   formula   supplementation   and   this   bottle   has   been   great   since   our   baby   was   1   month .   the   flow   is   so   slow   that   she   isn   t   getting   use   to   the   fast   flow   that   we   found   with   other   bottles .   it   s   a   bit   more   cleaning   time   but   we   love   this   bottle   and   the   baby   takes   to   it   easily .   i   am   very   disturbed   that   they   are   made   with   bpa   and   am   considering   throwing   them   in   the   trash .   i   will   do   the   research   now .   i   certainly   am   not   going   to   buy   any   new   ones .
nice   product   this   sheeting   pad   fits   the   portable   crib   nicely   and   is   soft   and   thick   and   waterproof .

  my   daughter   likes   to   play   with   the   tray   itself !   glad   i   got   it   though   as   it   helps   her   stay   seated   back   while   i   feed   her
love   this   swing   i   bought   a   second   hand   swing   at   a   thrift   store   and   used   it   every   day   for   about   a   month   before   the   motor   died   our   baby   loves   to   swing   for   naps   and   when   i   m   showering ,   cooking   or   otherwise   can   t   hold   her .   i   immediately   began   researching   for   a   new   swing   and   ordered   this   one   sunday   night .   the   swing   arrived   the   following   friday   afternoon .   she   and   we   love   this   swing !   our   baby   is   12   lbs ,   24   inches ,   11   weeks   old .   the   seat   is   deep   so   we   have   to   put   a   little   pillow   in   the   bottom   for   her   to   sit   on ,   otherwise   she   slides   forward   and   is   too   slumped   to   be   comfortable .   i   m   glad   the   swing   is   deep   because   she   ll   be   able   to   use   it   as   she   grows .   i   ve   read   reviews   that   said   the   tray   is   hard   to   open   and   makes   a   loud   noise   i   find   the   tray   easy   to   open   with   one   hand   and   it   s   very   quiet   if   you   re   careful .   if   you   re   in   a   hurry   it   does   make   a   snapping   sound   as   it   clicks   into   place .   we   ditched   the   mobile   because   it   interferes   with   the   swinging   arm   as   someone   else   noted   in   his   review   and   the   toys   are   directly   over   the   baby   s   head   where   she   can   t   see   them   anyway .   will   have   to   think   of   a   solution   when   baby   really   starts   noticing   toys .   the   swing   has   6   settings   we   use   the   high   setting   to   calm   her   and   help   her   get   to   sleep   as   recommended   by   dr . karp   in   happiest   baby   on   the   block   ,   then   put   the   swing   on   a   low   setting   while   she   sleeps .   the   swing   has   a   timer   option   but   if   you   don   t   use   the   timer ,   it   doesn   t   automatically   shut   off   as   other   swings   do .   we   like   that   it   works   continuously   since   she   sleeps   in   the   swing   at   night   right   beside   my   side   of   the   bed   where   i   hear   her   every   sniff   and   sigh   .   she   was   sleeping   five   hours   at   a   time   in   her   co   sleeper   but   in   the   swing   she   sleeps   up   to   12   hours   with   one   night   time   feeding .   i   feel   comfortable   letting   her   sleep   in   the   swing   since   we   swaddle   her   tightly   also   rec .   by   karp   and   the   swing   is   deep   as   noted   above .   we   don   t   use   the   complicated   5   point   straps   since   we   swaddle   her   and   use   the   tray   for   restraint .   even   when   she   isn   t   swaddled   we   feel   safe   leaving   her   unstrapped   with   an   adult   monitoring   in   the   same   room   and   she   is   very   active   always   kicking   and   flailing   her   arms   while   awake .   she   can   t   turn   herself   over   yet   though ,   so   we   may   have   to   use   the   straps   later .   another   reason   we   feel   safe   letting   her   sleep   in   the   swing   is   that   even   with   poor   neck   strength   at   this   age ,   her   head   doesn   t   flop   forward   even   on   the   highest   setting .   i   haven   t   had   to   adjust   the   swing   back   so   can   t   comment   on   that   when   we   first   put   it   together   she   reclined   nicely   in   it .   i   m   thrilled   so   far   with   the   battery   life .   we   ve   been   using   the   swing   every   day   and   night   for   nine   days   now   we   frequently   use   the   high   setting   and   the   batteries   show   no   sign   of   slowing .   others   have   commented   that   the   music   is   boring   and   nature   sounds   are   horrible .   they   are .   we   don   t   use   the   music   since   she   doesn   t   seem   to   care   about   it   and   we   d   be   better   off   turning   on   a   cd   of   classical   music   instead .   we   don   t   use   the   nature   sounds   either   since   we   use   a   floor   fan   for   white   noise   that   she   likes ,   but   in   defense   of   graco   whether   they   planned   this   or   not   karp   points   out   that   babies   love   white   noise   which   is   what   the   nature   sounds   sound   like .   white   noise   is   similar   to   what   baby   hears   in   the   womb   a   loud   shhhhhh   as   blood   rushes   through   mother   s   circulatory   system .   the   swing   is   very   quiet   even   on   the   high   setting   as   i   said   she   sleeps   in   it   beside   me   and   i   m   a   light   sleeper .   while   the   swing   is   bulky ,   i   m   still   able   to   pick   it   up   and   move   it   daily   from   bedroom   to   living   room   to   kitchen   without   too   much   trouble .   it   s   bulky   but   not   heavy .   the   legs   do   fold   for   storage .   so   the   cons   for   us   mobile   is   useless ,   have   to   push   off   button   up   to   six   times   to   get   the   swing   to   stop   swinging ,   straps   are   laughably   complicated   maybe   to   prevent   older   children   from   removing   baby   before   mom   has   a   chance   to   notice   maybe   to   prevent   lawsuits   pros   for   us   deep ,   large ,   comfy   seat   weight   limit   30lbs   instead   of   more   common   25lbs   removable   head   immobilizer

great   keepsake !   i   ordered   this   for   my   new   little   nephew .   my   husband   saw   it   and   thought   i   had   ordered   it   for   our   little   boy .   he   loved   it   so   i   guess   i   will   have   to   order   another   one .   it   comes   in   a   gift   box   that   is   covered   with   baseballs .   the   box   is   just   as   cute   as   the   gift .   absolutely   loved   it ! !
britax   monarch   booster   i   am   happy   with   the   monarch   booster .   it   is   easy   to   put   the   back   on   off .   my   5   yr .   old   thinks   it   is   very   soft   and   comfortable .   i   can   tell   it   is   very   padded   .   i   like   the   wings   by   his   head ,   so   he   can   lean   up   and   sleep   on   longer   trips .   i   like   the   peace   of   mind   that   comes   with   having   a   britax   we   ve   used   the   marathon   and   roundabout   previously   .   the   only   negative   is   that   it   is   a   little   difficult   putting   the   seat   belt   under   the   arm   rests .
best   nontoxic ,   chemical   free   baby   mattress   most   baby   mattresses   contain   a   whole   host   of   noxious   chemicals ,   including   pbde ,   pvc ,   etc .   this   mattress   contains   none   of   those   nasty   chemicals   and   use   healthy   alternatives .   i   bought   this   for   my   son   as   well   as   for   my   nephew   on   the   way .   it   s   certainly   more   expensive ,   but   i   felt   it   was   worth   it   for   the   peace   of   mind   and   the   health   of   my   child .   plus ,   i   can   use   it   for   the   next   one   and   share   it   with   my   sisters   when   their   baby   time   comes .

great   idea ... but   doesn   t   work   as   well   as   i   would   have   liked .   i   loved   the   idea   of   the   baberoo .. because   my   daughters   head   kept   flopping   to   the   side   when   she   fell   asleep   in   the   car   seat ... so   i   bought   the   baberoo .   it   worked   great   at   first   but   it   seemed   to   get   stretched   out   and   then   it   didn   t   work   quite   as   well .

my   daughter   loves   it   my   17   month   old   daughter   loves   this   pacifier .   she   is   old   enough   now   to   visually   recognize   this   passifier   vs   the   other   10   in   her   crib .   she   prefers   this   one .   i   think   i   am   guessing   here   that   it   is   because   the   plastic   is   thicker   and   more   rubbery   for   chewing   on   than   her   other   ones .   i   don   t   know ,   but   she   loves   it .

doesn   t   give   accurate   readings   both   my   wife   a   registered   nurse   and   i   tried   using   this   as   specified   in   the   directions ,   and   it   consistently   gives   low   readings .   my   son   s   temperature   was   101   according   to   two   other   thermometers   used   several   times   and   this   said   several   times   it   was   only   96 .   get   the   exergen   comfort   scanner   for   10   more   instead ,   it   is   what   our   pediatrician   uses   and   actually   works .
beautiful   gate ,   difficult   install   this   gate   is   beautiful ,   but   the   install   was   a   bit   difficult .   just   finding   the   right   distances   between   the   right   side   and   left   side .   overall ,   the   gate   works   wonderfully   and   is   a   great   barrier   for   our   daughter .
excellent   seat   saver   the   lionheart   seat   saver   does   an   excellent   job   in   keeping   your   car   upholstery   like   new .   i   was   able   to   get   a   tight   fit   by   getting   in   my   child   s   seat   while   installing .
appears   unsafe   uncomfortable   our   11   week   old ,   12   lb   baby   loves   her   graco   lovin   hug   easy   entry   open   top   curve   frame   swing   so   we   wanted   to   buy   a   take   along   swing   for   when   i   go   to   the   gym   or   take   her   to   grandma   s   house .   she   takes   naps   and   sleeps   in   her   graco   swing   at   night .   we   couldn   t   find   a   graco   take   along   so   we   bought   this   swing   at   target .   we   re   going   to   take   it   back   because   as   soon   as   we   put   her   in   it   she   tipped   all   the   way   back   until   she   was   flat   on   her   back   and   her   bottom   and   legs   were   higher   than   her   head !   i   took   her   out   immediately   after   trying   several   positions   to   see   if   she   could   sit   more   upright .   when   that   didn   t   work   we   checked   to   see   if   we   d   put   it   together   correctly   we   couldn   t   see   where   we   d   made   a   mistake   and   it   was   very   easy   to   put   together .   we   never   tried   swinging   her   in   it   since   it   didn   t   look   safe   or   comfortable .   we   bought   it   last   night   and   it   s   already   back   in   the   box   waiting   to   be   returned .
four   years   of   use   and   we   love   it !   this   monitor   is   the   best !   i   really   love   the   fact   that   both   units   can   be   cordless ,   the   baby   unit   is   rechargable ,   the   range   is   amazing ,   and   it   is   so   clear   that   you   can   easily   hear   the   baby   breathing !   after   four   years   and   two   kids   and   some   seriously   hard   wear   and   tear   we   needed   to   replace   ours   and   went   with   another   brand   because   of   some   extra   little   features   that   sounded   fun .   i   could   not   believe   how   horrible   it   was   in   comparison !   it   was   safety   1st   by   the   way .   i   realized   that   the   silly   features   some   monitors   offer   are   useless   if   overall   the   product   doesn   t   work .   needless   to   say   we   are   returning   it   and   going   with   what   we   know   is   tried   and   true .
cumbersome   okay   on   the   up   side ,   it   has   a   very   smooth   ride   and   is   spacious .   also ,   both   car   seat   and   stroller   come   apart   for   easy   cleaning .   but ...   the   seat   will   not   raise   to   an   upright   position ,   it   almost   gets   there   but   not   really ,   my   child   is   always   slightly   reclining   unless   he   sits   forward   without   resting   on   the   back .   this   stroller   folds   totally   weird ,   you   can   t   avoid   having   it   touch   the   ground   on   folding   let   us   imagine   parking   lot   grime   .   when   it   is   folded ,   it   cannot   remain   upright   unless   carefully   braced   against   something .   it   is   very ,   very   heavy   and   hard   to   lift .   would   you   like   to   place   it   in   your   trunk   ha   it   s   so   large   when   folded   you   must   wiggle ,   shift ,   flip   around   for   a   car   better   in   an   suv   but   still   heavy   and   hard   to   shift .   look   the   weight   of   it   and   the   crazed   way   it   folds   is   a   real   issue   remember   you   will   have   had   a   baby   and   later   you   will   be   trying   to   hold   a   baby   and   deal   with   it .   arduous .   ah   one   final   little   tiny   thing ,   the   viewing   window   on   the   canopy   has   a   velcro   flap   and   folds   forward   if   you   would   actually   like   to   look   at   your   child   you   will   have   to   hold   it   open   or   attach   your   own   extra   velcro   because   it   flips   toward   the   front   and   the   very   motion   of   moving   forward   closes   it ,   that   s   right   factory   velcro   is   set   up   not   to   hold   it   open   just   annoying .
very   good   value   for   the   money !   i   have   had   this   car   seat   for   over   1   year   and   it   has   served   our   family   well   with   two   different   cars .   we   have   one   car   with   the   latch   system   and   the   other   uses   just   seat   belts   for   securing   the   seat .   although   i   prefer   the   ease   of   the   latch   system ,   this   seat   is   also   easily   installed   with   a   seat   belt .   the   padding   is   well   cushioned   in   most   places .   when   items   are   spilled   on   it ,   the   lining   is   easily   removed   to   wash   and   easily   re   installed   too .   i   can   t   say   that   for   our   other   car   seat .   only   complaints   small   as   they   may   be   ,   adjusting   the   straps   around   my   daughter   are   sometimes   difficult   and   get   mis   adjusted   after   multiple   times   using .   the   only   way   to   fix   is   to   uninstall   the   whole   seat ,   readjust   the   straps   in   the   back   of   the   seat ,   then   reinstall   big   pain   .   fortunately ,   i   haven   t   had   to   do   this   much .   i   would   recommend   this   seat   to   anyone   because   all   things   considered   it   is   a   great   value   for   the   money .
handy   gate ,   does   the   trick   great   product .   low   price   and   fast ,   free   shipping   sold   me .   keeps   my   cats   away   from   the   front   door   and   escaping .
great   fit ,   excellent   product !   i   love   these   pj   s !   they   are   very   cute ,   thin   like   a   t   shirt ,   and   stretchy   enough   they   can   be   worn   longer   than   a   typical   garment .   you   will   not   be   dissatisfied .   as   for   the   zipper ,   it   does   stick   a   little   at   first ,   but   after   a   few   washings   its   just   fine .   i   have   not   seen   pj   s   like   this   bigger   than   9   mos ,   so   i   was   thrilled   these   go   up   to   24   mos .   ps .   shipping   takes   forever !
boon   squirt   when   the   spoon   is   almost   empty   it   splatters   in   the   baby   s   face .   there   is   stil   several   spoonfuls   left .   otherwise   a   good   product .
wonderful   these   cups   are   just   adorable .   my   baby   wouldn   t   take   other   sippy   cups   with   their   complicated   valve   systems   but   she   loves   these .   i   m   glad   they   started   putting   characters   on   them   instead   of   just   a   plain   cup .   very   happy   with   our   purchsse .
unknown   outcome   i   purchased   this   product   based   on   what   other   people   have   said   about   the   outcome   of   the   results .   i   find   the   instrument   to   be   too   loud   and   i   wonder   if   it   is   scaring   the   baby   more   than   it   is   suppose   to   help   the   baby   develop .   since   i   am   8   mos   pregnant   and   have   been   using   this   product   for   6   weeks   so   far ,   making   sure   i   make   the   time   2x   a   day   at   the   same   time   can   be   challenging   at   times .   in   the   beginning   the   baby   moves   a   little   but   i   find   that   it   puts   her   to   sleep ,   which   might   not   be   a   bad   thing   because   i   can   use   it   when   she   is   born   to   help   her   relax   to   sleep .   it   makes   me   want   to   sleep   too .   since   it   is   too   premature   to   say   if   it   does   everything   it   claims   to ,   i   can   t   give   it   5   stars .
good   for   the   price   this   carseat   was   exactly   what   i   wanted , and   there   wasn   t   anything   fancy   it   just   was   bare   bones   perfect .
wish   i   had   this   sling   when   my   baby   was   a   newborn   our   son   seemed   to   be   the   kind   of   baby   who   would   have   been   feeling   snuggly   and   secure   if   we   had   this   when   he   was   a   newborn .   it   seemed   as   though ,   because   he   was   not   used   to   being   carried   in   it   from   the   first   few   weeks ,   he   seemed   to   be   a   little   bit   claustrophobic   in   it .   by   the   time   we   got   it   he   had   grown   so   much   bigger   and   my   wife   was   not   able   to   nurse   him   in   it   the   way   it   is   suggested   for   newborns .   we   will   definately   be   keeping   it   for   our   next   child ,   though .
love   this   teether   what   a   cute   teether .... it   is   pretty   large   though .   very   colorful   and   cheerful ! ! !   my   grandbaby   really   likes   it   and   i   love   the   color .   great   buy .   you   will   not   be   disappointed ! ! !
more   than   i   had   hoped .   we   recently   purchased   this   simplicity   camille   crib .   it   is   beautiful .   i   spent   hours   and   hours   on   line   looking   for   a   nice   looking   crib   that   was   in   our   price   range .   this   one   fit   the   bill   perfectly ! ! !   most   cribs   of   this   type   were   much   more   expensive .   we   are   pleased   with   the   quality ,   all   pieces   were   there   and   assembly   was   easy .   it   is   a   shade   off   white   which   was   a   plus   for   us   as   it   matches   our   existing   furniture .   another   plus   is   that   the   side   goes   down .   so   many   of   the   new   cribs   do   not   have   this   feature .   it   is   a   must   for   me   as   i   am   on   the   short   side .
i   would   recommend   this   product   to   anyone .   excellent   at   keeping   my   babies   drinks   cold ,   it   has   handles   many   falls   without   dents ,   my   daughter   finds   it   really   easy   to   hold   and   drink   out   of ,   i   would   recommend   this   product   to   anyone .
not   a   fan   of   bebesounds   angelcare   we   purchased   this   monitor   for   our   first   born   7   2008   and   were   very   dissatisfied .   there   is   not   a   way   to   disable   to   movement   sensor   even   by   just   unplugging   it .   i   was   on   the   phone   with   graco   for   over   45   minutes   and   they   could   not   figure   it   out   either .   main   issue   with   this   monitoring   is   that   an   alarm   sounds   on   both   the   receiver   end   and   the   baby   s   end   whenever   movement   is   not   detected   for   over   20   seconds .   all   i   can   figure   is   it   alarms   for   baby   to   make   her   stir   and   start   moving   again .   in   our   case   all   it   did   is   upset   our   newborn   who   we   d   just   spend   2   hours   trying   to   get   to   sleep .   needless   to   say ,   without   the   ability   to   disable   the   movement   sensor   and   alarm ,   this   was   of   no   use   to   us   and   we   returned   it   for   a   more   basic   monitoring   system .   parents   should   know   this   alarm   is   unnerving   for   both   you   who   might   possibly   be   sleep   deprived   and   for   baby ...   its   a   poor   design   when   you   don   t   have   the   option   to   turn   off   features   such   as   the   movement   sensor .   lame .
we   still   use   this   for   our   11   month   old   when   i   brought   this   home   my   wife   was   a   little   bit   weary   of   using   it ,   as   they   give   so   many   warnings   of   strangulation   hazards   and   babies   falling   out   of   it .   she   does ,   however ,   use   it   several   times   a   week   and   doesn   t   know   what   she   will   do   when   he   grows   too   heavy   for   it .   he   is   11   1   2   months   old   now   and   is   still   somewhat   clingy .   she   wanted   to   use   a   baby   sling   but   because   he   was   too   old   already   when   we   were   able   to   buy   one ,   he   never   really   seemed   happy   in   it .   he   sits   in   this   sling   for   up   to   an   hour   at   a   time   while   she   is   busy   with   household   chores .   now   we   have   both   for   next   time   around .
great   item   very   simple   to   assemble .   only   complaint   is   that   it   sticks   to   the   floor   so   you   ll   have   to   lift   the   chair   to   push   your   child   closer   to   the   table .   great   product .
my   11   month   old   loves   this !   a   simple   toy   without   batteries   that   my   11   month   old   plays   with   over   and   over .   helps   with   his   fine   motor   skilss   and   very   colorful   fun   and   sturdy !
great   concept ,   inferior   replacement   less   parts !   i   really   like   this   cup .   however ,   i   have   had   it   for   less   than   two   months   and   my   the   soft   spout   is   splitting .   my   son   is   just   over   a   year   and   toothless   so   he   didn   t   bite   it   apart !   i   am   having   a   hard   time   getting   any   response   from   the   company ... i   also   bought   the   straw   version   for   my   older   son   and   love   it .   the   downside   is   that   the   valves   on   both   styles   are   hard   to   keep   clean   and   seem   rather   brittle .   again ,   no   available   replacement   pieces .   i   haven   t   had   any   problems   with   leaking   as   others   have   complained   about .   the   cup   is   very   durable   and   effective   in   keeping   beverages   cold   but   the   plastic   parts   seem   to   be   inferior   unfortunately ...
best   baby   spoons   you   can   buy !   these   spoons   are   awesome !   they   are   actually   like   a   spoon   in   the   fact   that   they   hold   watery   baby   cereal   or   food .   the   gerber   spoons   are   almost   totally   flat   and   just   make   a   very   frustrating   mess .   i   threw   all   my   gerber   spoons   away   when   these   arrived .   the   only   bummer   is   that   shipping   is   almost   the   same   price   as   the   spoons   but   it   is   so   worth   it !   excellent   product !
one   of   our   6   mo .   old   twins   favorite   toys   if   my   sons   could   talk ,   they   would   tell   you   this   is   currently   their   2nd   favorite   toy ,   right   after   their   jumperoo .   they   love   the   bright   colors   on   the   mat ,   and   teething   on   the   little   stuffed   feet   that   are   on   the   worm   during   tummy   time .   their   favorite   toy   is   the   bug   rattle .   i   have   not   had   safety   issues   with   this   toy .   the   bar   has   never   fallen   over   on   them ,   and   the   toy   is   lead   free .   zipped   up ,   it   is   amazingly   compact ,   so   it   travels   well ,   or   stores   well   in   a   small   space .   i   don   t   think   there   is   a   toy   in   the   world   that   a   child   under   6   months   old   could   safely   be   left   alone   with ,   so   i   wouldn   t   let   that   comment   in   previous   reviews   influence   my   decision   in   purchasing   this   basically   safe   and   very   fun   toy .   developmentally   this   provides   all   the   right   activities .   if   i   could   change   any   one   thing   about   this   toy   it   would   be   that   it   really   only   fits   kids   0   6   months .   asin   b0018979my   infantino   s   monkey   s   jungle   retreat   grows   with   the   child   beyond   6   months ,   and   if   i   d   known   that   sooner ,   i   d   have   bought   that   first   instead .
can   t   be   without   these   i   have   a   three   year   old   and   we   love   these .   they   are   great   and   easy   to   use .   i   highly   recommend   these   to   anyone !
the   reviews   are   accurate   like   others   here ,   this   wouldn   t   stick   on   our   toilet   for   more   than   5   minutes .   it   s   probably   the   worst   toilet   lock   on   the   market .   don   t   bother   even   trying   it .
very   helpful   but   could   have   a   larger   lcd   screen   its   a   very   good   product   qualitywise   and   all   but   i   could   use   a   larger   lcd   screen   on   the   handheld   monitor .
worth   the   money   i   really   liked   this   warmer .   i   was   given   one   when   my   first   daughter   was   born .   as   some   of   the   reviews   state ,   it   may   take   a   little   practise   to   get   used   to   how   much   water   to   put   in ,   but   that   doesn   t   take   much   to   master .   the   only   recommendation   that   i   have   is   that   if   you   use   the   dr .   brown   s   bottles   with   the   tubes   in   them ,   take   the   tubes   out   before   putting   the   bottle   in   the   warmer ,   or   you   ll   end   up   with   the   milk   leaking   into   the   warmer .
love   the   gumdrop   pacifiers   my   daughter   is   10   weeks   old   she   loves   the   gumdrop   pacifiers ,   she   won   t   take   anything   else .   we   used   the   soothie   brand   as   we   were   given   it   in   the   hospital   but   they   are   too   big   and   round   and   the   gumdrops   fit   their   little   faces   just   right .   i   am   recommending   this   product   to   all   new   moms .
germ   collector   if   you   pull   the   nipple   all   the   way   to   the   sides ,   out   will   come   a   collection   of   things   from   hair   to   lint   to   dry   milk ... one   day   while   cleaning   one   of   the   pacifiers   i   noticed   a   piece   of   hair   stuck   to   the   base   of   the   nipple ,   when   i   pulled   the   nipple   to   the   side ,   the   hair   still   wouldn   t   come   off ,   so   i   pulled   it   really   hard   and   along   with   the   hair   came   a   string   of   lint ... i   did   the   same   thing   to   the   other   3   pacifiers   and   it   was   the   same ... since   then   i   kept   an   eye   on   these   nipples   and   noticed   that   even   within   a   few   hours   of   use ,   it   still   collected   lint   and   other   things ......   i   regularly   would   boil   the   pacifiers   and   wash   around   the   base   of   the   nipple ,   but   this   isn   t   enough   for   these   pacifiers ... i   am   sending   these   nipples   back   to   the   company   for   my   back ... don   t   buy   these   unless   you   are   willing   to   constantly   keep   washing   them   within   a   few   hours   throughout   the   day ...

wonderful   binky   i   recieved   two   as   a   gift   at   my   shower   for   my   second   son   and   was   hesitant   because   my   first   rejected   every   binky   sold   at   bru .   but   this   time   around   it   works   like   a   charm ,   its   the   only   one   he   takes   so   i   have   5   in   storage   in   case   we   lose   one .   it   doesnt   leave   marks   on   his   face   and   fits   just   right   in   his   mouth
good   idea   i   love   the   idea   behind   these   pacifiers .   my   problem   has   been   that   i   am   unable   to   find   a   holder   to   attach   the   pacifer   on   to   the   baby   s   clothing   that   matches   the   color   scheme   for   girls .   i   have   only   found   the   blue   one   for   boys .
very   useful   we   have   two   of   these   now .   i   bought   my   husband   one   when   he   came   home   from   rehap   recently   and   he   liked   it   so   much   that   he   ordered   a   second   one .   he   uses   them   to   steady   himself   in   the   shower .   i   don   t   believe   you   can   put   much   weight   on   them   but   for   balance   they   are   very   useful .
love   this   entertaining   great   to   use   highchair .   i   love   this   high   chair .   i   would   buy   it   again   no   questions   asked .   it   is   great   as   an   entertainer   while   i   do   my   dishes   or   clean   up   in   the   dinning   room .   plastic   seat   washes   easily .   great   high   adjustments   as   well   as   reclining .   my   daughter   is   11   months   old ,   we   ve   been   using   this   since   she   was   4   months   old   and   she   still   loves   it .   5   stars !   also   is   unisex ! !
sipper   cap   great   cap !   i   bought   the   pack   of   2   blue   ones ,   since   most   of   the   bottles   we   end   up   buying   match   those .   so   far ,   they   haven   t   leaked   on   nestle ,   dasani ,   deer   park ,   and   aquafina   bottles .   they   re   great   in   a   pinch   and   we   always   keep   one   in   our   diaper   bag   and   one   in   my   purse .
very   happy   i   love   my   new   car   seat .   this   is   the   third   infant   carrier   i   ve   owned   and   it   is   by   far   my   favorite .   things   i   love   about   it   easy   to   adjust   strap   tightness ,   fits   infants   to   30   lbs . ,   seems   comfortable   to   infant ,   easy   to   clean   fabric ,   light   color   to   reflect   light ,   infants   head   doesn   t   flop   when   sleeping ,   comfortable   handle ,   easy   to   put   into   and   get   out   of   car ,   carseat   base   secures   into   car   well ,   great   price   for   quality ,   can   be   used   with   our   old   double   graco   stroller   although   it   fits   very   tight .   things   to   consider   it   is   bigger   than   other   carseats   but   it   still   fits   in   our   camery   with   backless   booster   seat   on   each   side ,   it   was   difficult   to   buckle   in   a   newborn   since   the   chest   buckle   is   so   big .   i   don   t   think   it   s   too   heavy   or   big   to   carry   around .   i   m   very   happy   with   the   quality   of   the   safe   seat .
paci   that   stays   clean !   this   pacifier   would   of   been   great   if   i   had   given   it   too   my   daughter   when   she   was   younger .   i   was   tired   of   cleaning   of   pacifiers   that   she   drops   at   10   months   and   found   this   one .   she   didn   t   take   to   it   as   she   was   used   to   the   old   one .   i   love   how   it   closes   when   it   hits   the   ground .   however ,   when   she   picks   it   up   off   the   ground   she   can   t   open   it   back   up   to   reuse   and   tries   to   stick   the   whole   thing   w   the   plastic   cover   back   into   her   mouth   and   that   doesn   t   work   well .   so   i   don   t   use   it   as   pacifier   anymore   it   is   more   of   a   toy   when   we   are   shopping   that   she   plays   with   trying   to   open   and   close !
middle   class   sleeper   the   porta   crib   is   ok .   the   bassinet   has   too   much   give   and   the   pad   didn   t   give   much   support .   my   daughter   wouldn   t   sleep   in   it .   so   i   ended   up   puting   a   porta   crib   mattress   in   it   even   though   it   says   not   to .   it   did   seem   to   give   it   more   support   and   she   finally   slept   in   it .   i   did   like   that   it   had   a   caddy   for   the   diapers   and   wipes .   although   my   daughter   is   only   three   months   and   already   too   big   for   the   changing   table .   all   in   all ,   i   got   what   i   paid   for .   it   is   definately   good   enough   for   vacations .   hopefully ,   when   she   is   big   enough   be   put   in   the   bottom   it   will   be   more   useful   to   us .
huge   pillow   holy   moly !   my   wife   and   i   bought   this   on   a   wednesday ,   received   it   on   the   following   friday ,   and   installed   it   saturday ,   and   removed   it   by   sunday   in   the   early   evening   and   had   it   in   the   box ,   paperwork   printed   out   to   return   it .   installation   no   problem .   so   long   as   you   can   read   and   understand   the   directions ,   installation   shouldn   t   take   more   than   about   10   minutes ,   and   it   was   fairly   easy .   comfortableness   lousy .   the   adjustable   pillow   is   enormous .   yes ,   it   is   conveniently   adjustable ,   but   it   extends   forward   from   the   seat   back   about   3   inches .   it   is   also   not   removable ,   so   we   couldn   t   just   remove   it   so   we   could   still   use   it .   it   may   not   happen   to   all   babies ,   but   our   son   s   head   was   pushed   forward   too   much   for   us   to   feel   comfortable   leaving   him   in   it   for   any   length   of   time .   i   suggest   if   you   re   looking   to   purchase   a   car   seat ,   go   to   the   store   where   you   can   put   your   mitts   on   them   and   babies   in   them ,   decide   if   you   like   it   in   the   store ,   and   then   order   it   from   somewhere   online .   after   this   carseat   is   sent   back ,   my   wife   and   i   plan   on   doing   just   that .
does   not   fit   all   three   wheel   strollers   this   product   is   perhaps   nice ,   however   not   for   all   three   wheel   strollers   as   described   on   the   web   site .   so ,   i   m   returning   it .   on   the   package   is   clearly   written   it   zips   to   all   runabout   tri   modetm   model   strollers .   if   this   info   was   provided   on   the   web   page ,   i   would   not   buy   this   product .
greate   product   its   great   because   of   a   few   reasons   1   the   right   left   side   you   could   tuck   under   vary   important   2   its   washable   3   its   comfortable   4   water   does   not   go   through   but   one   miner   suggestion   i   would   have   it   should   be   a   little   longer
perfect   second   seat !   i   am   by   no   means   a   brand   snob ,   so   when   i   wanted   to   get   a   second   seat   for   my   daughter   to   use   when   she   s   at   her   grandma   s   house ,   i   turned   to   this   one .   it   was   the   most   inexpensive   seat   i   found   that   still   had   everything   i   wanted .   it   is   easy   to   get   in   and   out ,   which   is   perfect   because   the   grandparents   can   use   it   in   whichever   car   they   want .   its   not   quite   as   comfy   as   the   one   we   got   for   my   car   an   evenflo   ,   but   since   we   don   t   use   it   on   long   distances ,   it   works   out   fine .   i   found   this   on   sale   at   target   for   30 ,   and   i   m   glad   i   didn   t   spend   any   more   for   a   second   seat .   this   one   works   just   perfectly !

what   a   waste ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !   i   bought   this   walker   for   my   5   month   old   on   5   22   08   and   already   returned   it .   assembly   was   a   little   tricky   and   the   walker   is   extremely   boring .   the   musical   castle   is   a   joke .   it   plays   for   about   30   seconds   unless   you   keep   pushing   on   it .   the   quality   of   this   item   is   awful .   the   walker   doesn   t   turn   easily .   it   s   absolutely   ridiculous .   thank   goodness   i   bought   it   from   walmart   and   didn   t   have   to   pay   to   send   it   back .   i   replaced   this   walker   with   the   3   in   1   combi   car   walker .   i   can   t   wait   to   get   it   in   and   have   my   daughter   try   it   out .
great   product !   i   ordered   this   ladybug   for   my   4   year   old   daughter   who   is   afraid   of   the   dark .   i   wanted   something   to   give   a   little   light   in   her   room ,   but   not   so   bright   that   she   wouldn   t   be   able   to   sleep .   this   night   light   is   perfect .   the   stars   give   just   enough   light ,   and   the   timer   is   great .   we   keep   the   light   on   as   she   falls   asleep ,   and   then   it   turns   off   automatically   after   45   minutes .   we   love   this   nightlight !
disregard   three   stars   it   s   a   waste   of   money   i   first   rated   this   item   about   a   month   ago   after   three   or   four   uses .   i   pulled   it   out   today   for   the   first   time   since   then ,   and   it   was   dead .   i   tried   replacing   the   battery ,   and   nothing   happened .   i   can   t   update   the   number   of   stars   provided ,   but   it   i   were   to   rate   it   again   today ,   i   would   give   it   one .
great   buy ,   could   have   less   interference   we   bought   this   graco   monitor   as   a   replacement   for   our   useless   fisher   price   monitor   we   used   the   fp   monitor   once   and   then   put   it   away   for   a   month   when   we   needed   it   again   the   receiver   was   dead   and   the   difference   is   something   big .   br   pros   br   1 .   auto   channel   selector   great   feature   just   turn   it   on   an   it   will   set   automatically   the   channel   on   both   receivers ,   if   you   feel   it   has   lots   of   interference   just   press   ch   button   and   presto !   br   2 .   vibe   function   good   but   nothing   i   couln   d   live   without .   it   s   too   sensitive ,   almost   any   noise   will   activate   it .   br   cons   the   channel   button   it   should   be   on   the   parent   receiver   and   not   on   the   baby   s   transmitter ,   here   is   how   it   goes ,   imagine   yourself   sleeping ,   and   the   monitor   begins   to   sound   with   static   are   you   going   to   go   to   baby   s   room   and   to   try   to   change   the   channel   at   the   risk   of   waking   up   your   baby   so   the   channel   button   should   be   with   the   parent   unit !   hey   the   baby   is   not   going   to   change   the   channel  
love   it ! ! !   love   this   booster .   i   was   a   little   worried   after   reading   about   installation   problems ,   but   got   it   anyway .   i   have   two   britax   boulevards   and   love   them .   it   was   a   little   tricky   to   install ,   but   once   i   figured   out   you   have   to   thread   the   tightening   straps   through   the   holes   in   the   seat   part   of   the   car   seat   and   pull   to   tighten ,   they   tightened   just   fine .   i   used   the   latch   installation .   it   is   pretty   solid .   the   5   point   harness   is   to   easy   to   buckle ,   my   5   year   old   daughter   can   do   it   herself .   i   love   having   the   added   security   of   the   5   point   harness   and   the   side   impact   protection .   go   britax !
best   baby   purchase   i   made !   drop   those   pregnancy   pounds ,   mommies !   i   absolutely   love   this   stroller   i   have   red   .   as   a   previous   reviewer   noted ,   it   s   easy   to   assemble .   it   s   also   light ,   very   easy   to   manoeuvre ,   and   my   son   is   comfortable   in   it .   as   an   avid   runner ,   i   bought   one   for   my   first   son   because   i   was   very   eager   to   get   back   out   there .   this   stroller   made   it   easy   and   i   was   back   in   shape   in   no   time .   i   m   expecting   my   second   son   in   a   few   weeks   and   would   have   bought   a   double   jogger   from   baby   jogger   but   was   generously   given   a   bob   revolution   duallie .   it   s   gotten   great   reviews ,   too ,   but   i   loved   this   stroller   so   much   i   was   almost   disappointed .   we   ll   see !   i   highly   recommend   this   stroller .   it   is   definitely   worth   the   price .
not   all   it   s   cracked   up   to   be   i   read   all   the   reviews   and   although   i   cannot   say   it   is   a   bad   pacifier ,   all   i   can   say   is   that   my   daugther   hates   it .   she   screams   when   we   try   to   give   it   to   her .   but   children   s   sucking   preferences   are   different   and   my   child   does   not   like   this   one   bit .
can   t   live   without   it !   my   daughter   just   turned   one .   even   though   the   age   limit   to   the   wubbanubs   is   6   months ,   she   loves   hers   and   can   t   live   without   it !   we   are   trying   to   wean   her   off   of   it ,   so   we   have   3   of   them   one   is   the   regular   wubbanub ,   one   has   a   tiny   part   of   the   tip   of   the   paci   snipped   off ,   and   the   third   one   we   removed   the   paci   all   together   so   it   looks   like   a   regular   horse .   we   re   transitioning   to   the   snipped   off   one ,   then   to   the   one   with   no   paci   on   the   end .   they   are   a   great   product !
my   twins   love   them   i   had   twins   at   36   weeks   and   they   were   given   these   pacifiers   at   the   hospital .   they   both   love   them   and   won   t   take   to   anything   else .   i   tried   a   different   paci   when   we   were   at   the   store   and   it   fell   on   the   floor .   one   of   my   boys   just   cried   and   refused   to   take   it .   if   you   like   something   visually   different ,   try   the   gumdrop   pacifiers .   they   are   awesome   too .   one   of   my   boys   loves   that   one   and   the   other   loves   the   soothies ,   but   they   re   pretty   much   interchangeable   as   they   both   have   the   same   nipple   type .   the   gumdrop   pacifiers   also   come   in   preemie   size .
weird   taste   and   smell   i   am   not   sure   if   i   just   got   a   bad   apple ,   but   when   my   pacifier   came   i   opened   the   bag   and   it   smelled   weird   like   rubber   on   a   tire .   the   pacifier   also   tasted   like   you   were   sucking   on   a   tire   and   my   4   month   old   was   not   impressed .   i   think   it   s   a   great   idea   to   have   the   frog   attached   to   the   paci   and   my   baby   likes   to   play   with   the   frog   but   the   pacifier   tastes   weird   to   him   and   he   won   t   touch   that .
love   this   pacifier !   my   daughter   3.5   mos   old   now   loves   this   pacifier !   she   can   actually   hold   onto   it   at   this   age ,   and   we   can   tuck   one   leg   of   it   under   her   stroller   or   car   seat   strap   so   that   it   is   easily   accessible   to   her .   we   have   bought   two   of   them   so   we   have   one   for   the   carseat   and   one   for   the   house   would   definitely   recommend !
hospitals   use   this   pacifier   for   a   reason   this   pacifier   was   given   to   my   daughter   at   the   hospital .   she   took   to   it   right   away ,   and   had   no   nipple   confusion   with   nursing   either .   i   m   so   happy   that   i   can   buy   a   few   more   since   she   doesn   t   like   the   other   kinds   of   pacifiers .   you   always   need   a   couple .   it   s   great   to   have   something   that   calms   a   baby ,   and   this   pacifier   did   just   that   for   my   baby .
we   love   these !   the   1st   pacifier   my   daughter   was   given   was   the   hospital   pacifier   which   made   it   very   difficult   to   get   her   take   anything   else   because   of   the   different   shapes ....   my   only   problem   with   the   hosp .   pacifier   is   the   shape   its   round   so   when   she   got   a   cold   it   blocked   her   nose   and   the   shape   of   these   pacifiers   are   great !   they   let   her   breath   and   she   absolutely   loves   them !   i   highly   reccommend   them   to   everyone   i   know   that   has   a   new   baby !
gum   drop   pacifier   i   bought   these   pacifiers   for   my   niece   after   she   was   born   and   now   my   sister   can   t   live   without   it .   so ,   i   bought   another !   she   is   attached   to   it !
mr .   frog   loves   his   new   home !   i   got   this   as   a   push   gift   for   my   wife ,   but   given   that   our   baby   is   as   stubborn   as   i   am ,   i   gave   it   to   her   as   a   small   mothers   day   gift .   she   loves   it .   i   can   t   give   much   of   a   review   on   how   the   baby   enjoys   it   as   she   s   not   gonna   be   here   till   wednesday ,   but   we   re   sure   she   ll   love   it ...
it   was   good   i   bought   this   as   a   gift ,   it   wasn   t   like   what   i   saw   in   the   picture ,   the   color   was   very   darker   than   it   is   in   the   picture ,   and   the   model   was   a   bit   different ,   the   shipping   time   was   good ,   at   end   i   recommend   it   coz   it   s   nice   anyway .
my   2   month   old   cannot   keep   it   in   my   baby   likes   his   avent   paci   just   fine ,   but   i   bought   this   one   to   try   it   out   since   it   is   more   natural   nipple   shaped   than   the   avent .   he   takes   it   initially   with   no   problem ,   but   cannot   seem   to   keep   it   in   his   mouth   more   than   a   few   seconds .   i   had   to   keep   popping   it   back   in .   i   really   did   give   it   many   tries ,   but   the   problem   persists .   another   downside   is   aesthetics .   i   find   it   ugly   and   kind   of   creepy   looking .   the   avent   paci   is   clear ,   small ,   well   ventilated   and   is   easy   to   attach   to   a   keeper .   i   couldn   t   figure   out   how   to   attach   the   soothie   to   the   kind   of   keeper   i   have .   needless   to   say ,   i   m   staying   with   the   avent .   plus ,   the   avent   comes   with   a   cover   to   keep   it   clean .   to   each   their   own ,   however .   baby   will   have   to   decide ,   not   mom   and   dad !
great   idea ,   fuction   needs   work   i   needed   a   pacifier   to   stay   in   my   sons   mouth   while   sleeping .   this   was   the   perfectidea .   i   had   alreayd   made   1   myself   at   homoe ,   but   it   was   stupid   looking .   mine   turned   out   better   becuase   it   was   a   little   bigger   and   heavier   so   it   spread   out   across   the   infants   chest   to   keep   the   pacifier   in   place   and   he   held   onto   it .   this   one   was   much   better   lookig   but   it   was   so   light   it   fell   out   all   the   time .   the   legs   really   needed   ot   be   bean   bag   filled .   i   have   a   frog   with   bean   beg   legs   and   made   my   own .   it   s   a   great   idea   and   probably   works   for   most ,   it   just   didn   t   for   me .
happy   baby   gerber   naturalflex   silicone   pacifier   green   blue   this   is   the   one   and   only   pacifier   that   i   have   found   that   my   nephew   will   keep   in   his   mouth .   all   of   the   others   we   tried ,   we   had   to   sit   there   and   hold   them   in   while   he   sucked   them   or   they   would   just   pop   out .   plus   some   of   our   friends   are   very   amazed   that   you   can   look   down   inside   the   pacifier   and   see   them   actually   sucking   it .   great   pacifier ,   used   this   style   on   one   of   my   grandchildren ,   and   this   is   an   updated   version .   i   love   it ,   more   important   he   loves   it .
wubbanuberiffic   we   have   twin   girls   that   are   almost   2   months .   wubbanums   have   been   a   life   saver .   when   one   or   both   starts   screaming ,   they   are   instantly   soothed   by   the   pacifier   and   because   of   the   extra   weight   the   stay   in   as   opposed   to   other   pacifiers   that   fall   out   followed   by   even   great   cries .   of   all   the   things   we   have   gotten   so   far   wubbanubs   has   been   the   best !
love   this !   love   this   pacifier   teether .   my   7   month   never   used   a   pacifier   but   needs   to   suck   on   something .   this   thing   is   huge ... he   doesn   t   really   use   it   like   a   pacifier   to   suck   on   the   nipple   part ,   he   just   sucks   on   all   the   parts !   it   s   great   because   every   piece   of   this   is   suckable ! !   he   totally   grabs   for   this   all   the   time   and   it   s   not   a   choking   hazard   because   it   s   so   big .   i   bought   two   of   them !
had   to   get   more   i   had   to   get   more   of   these   after   my   hospital   gave   this   to   my   newborn   he   won   t   take   another   pacifier   now   they   are   very   well   made   and   rubber   construction   but   i   had   a   bunch   of   another   brand .
get   the   colored   ones   i   ve   tried   a   few   different   brands   of   pacifiers   and   these   were   hands   down   the   best .   i   tried   the   nuk   type   and   they   kept   flying   out   of   my   baby   s   mouth .   she   has   done   well   with   these   since   birth   she   is   now   9   months   .   she   had   some   of   the   clear   pacifiers   and   they   were   so   hard   to   find   if   they   fell   or   got   misplaced .   try   the   colored   ones .   i   highly   recommend   them !
beware   if   your   baby   sucks   on   everything   i   loved   the   look ,   the   feel ,   everything   about   this   chain   until   this   weekend .   i   bought   at   christmas   for   my   son ,   he   is   now   4.5   months   2   months   later   and   teething ,   puts   everything   in   his   mouth   and   sucks   on   everything .   well   the   wetness   caused   the   wood   to   crack   on   three   beads ,   i   noticed   it   in   time ,   a   small   bit   of   pressure   with   my   fingers   and   was   able   to   break   all   three   beads   into   pieces .   i   am   so   glad   this   didn   t   happen   when   my   son   was   playing   with   it ,   easy   to   choke   on   these   pieces .   if   you   use   this   item   makes   sure   to   check   often   for   cracks !
womb   sounds   bear   is   excellent   for   newborn !   i   purchased   the   womb   bear   for   my   new   granddaughter .   she   loves   it !   it   helps   her   relax   when   she   is   crying .   it   also   has   a   velcro   fastener   to   attach   to   the   crib   which   is   excellent .   a   must   for   a   newborn !
my   son   loves   his   froggy !   my   son   loves   this   pacifier !   he   is   four   months   old   and   is   learning   how   to   grab   the   frog ,   not   just   the   pacifier   part .   it   soothes   him !   he   was   given   the   soothies   pacifier   in   the   nicu ,   and   i   just   never   bought   him   any   other   brand ,   so   when   i   saw   this ,   i   thought   it   was   so   cute !   i   can   even   put   it   in   the   sanitizer .   the   only   thing   that   i   don   t   like   is   that   you   can   t   take   the   pacifier   off .   it   is   sewn   on .   other   than   that ,   it   is   great   and   i   would   recommend   it .
the   only   one   my   baby   liked !   i   tried   pacifier   after   pacifier   to   no   avail .   most   pacifiers   seemed   to   be   too   long   and   gag   my   newborn ,   but   not   this   one . my   brother   suggested   this   one   because   it   is   the   one   the   hospital   gave   to   his   son   who   was   premature .   my   son   liked   it   instantly .   no   spitting   it   out .   this   was   even   better   than   the   nuk   for   newborns .
unique   and   fairly   good   produce   this   pacifier   is   a   good   idea   and   works   well .   as   described ,   it   does   close   when   dropped ,   keeping   it   clean .   the   plastic   outside   of   the   device   is   bulky   and   seemingly   uncomfortable   for   my   baby ,   however .   there   is   little   air   movement   between   the   pacifier   and   the   skin ,   like   other   pacifiers ,   due   to   how   this   pacifier   must   be   designed   to   close   when   dropped .   overall   a   good   product .
don   t   buy   this !   you   will   end   up   making   your   own !   these   little   wubbanub   s   looked   like   the   perfect   answer   for   my   three   month   old   who   was   constantly   losing   his   binky   all   day   long .   i   thought   it   would   help   him   learn   to   put   it   back   in   as   well   as   be   weighty   enough   to   lay   on   his   chest   in   just   the   right   spot   so   if   he   fell   asleep   he   could   pop   it   back   in   himself .   and   believe   it   or   not   it   did   all   those   things .   however   my   son   totally   hated   the   pacifier .   we   had   been   using   every   brand   of   binkies ,   so   i   figured   what   s   another   new   brand   right   wrong !   we   had   used   nuks ,   playtex ,   avent ,   etc .   all   with   no   problem   but   the   soothie   pacifier   attached   to   this   wubbanub   is   huge .   i   am   not   kidding .   not   just   huge   on   the   outside   plastered   on   your   little   one   s   face ... but   huge   like   a   giant   long   nipple   too !   coupled   with   the   fact   it   was   ugly   as   sin   it   made   for   hilarity   at   starbucks   one   day   when   all   the   other   mommies   watched   in   horror   as   i   proudly   pulled   out   my   new   fancy   wubba   to   give   to   my   little   one   and   he   proceeded   to   choke   like   a   bulimic   after   thanksgiving .   and ,   the   poor   little   dude   kept   giving   it   the   old   college   try   because   he   wanted   the   sucker   and   i   let   him   because   i   forgot   back   up .   i   just   kept   praying   he   d   make   it   work .   it   was   all   very   sad .   long   story   much   shorter   i   sent   my   hubby   to   babies   r   us   to   pick   up   as   many   small   stuffed   animals   as   he   could   find .   that   weekend   i   bought   velcro   and   we   created   our   own   wubanubs .   here   are   3   major   benifits   to   making   your   own   br   1   you   can   detach   the   pacifier   and   wash   it   for   real .   as   well   as   wash   the   buddy   it   is   attached   too !   unlike   the   wubba .   important   the   wubbanub   does   not   come   apart   very   gross   and   stupid   br   2   you   can   use   whatever   brand   of   pacifier   your   little   one   enjoys ,   a   major   plus   if   you   actually   want   this   whole   learn   your   paci   is   attached   to   a   frog   thing   to   work .   br   and   br   3   compared   to   the   ugly   things   my   little   macgyvered   knock   offs   look   amazing .   and   that   should   tell   you   something   about   how   hideous   these   actually   are .   seriously ,   i   am   far   from   ambitious .   i   don   t   scrapbook ,   paint ,   or   even   cook   anything   that   requires   anything   more   then   buttons   on   the   microwave   so   if   you   do   yours   will   probably   be   even   more   fantastically   superior   to   these   little   nightmares   br   br   i   have   to   say   one   nice   thing   though .   it   truly   is   a   great   idea .   but   a   better   idea   is   to   just   make   your   own . n   cook   anything   that   requires   anything   more   then   buttons   on   the   microwave   so   if   you   do   yours   will   probably   be   even   more   fantastically   superior   to   these   little   nightmares   i   have   to   say   one   nice   thing   though .   it   truly   is   a   great   idea .   but   a   better   idea   is   to   just   make   your   own .
greatest   thing   since   sliced   bread !   i   had   my   son   in   july   and   4   days   after   his   birth   we   had   to   take   him   to   the   nicu   because   he   had   jaundice   so   bad .   while   in   the   nicu   the   nurse   asked   us   if   he   likes   a   pacifier .   i   said   i   wasn   t   sure   because   we   had   given   him   one   of   those   nuk   pacifiers   and   he   spit   it   out   and   didn   t   like   it .   she   then   order   him   the   red   dog   wubba   nub   and   he   has   been   using   it   ever   since !   we   liked   them   so   much   i   ordered   the   blue   horse   for   his   diaper   bag   and   got   green   frog   for   the   downstairs   in   my   house .   there   is   literally   a   wubba   nub   everywhere   and   we   don   t   leave   home   with   out   it .   kids   love   the   plush   animal   and   like   the   other   reviewer   stated   it   keeps   the   pacifier   in   the   babies   mouth .   the   wubba   nub   for   me   has   been   a   life   safer   cuz   it   has   allowed   me   to   give   my   son   the   pacifier   without   having   to   hold   it   so   i   can   be   off   cleaning   or   doing   other   things   and   don   t   have   to   listen   to   a   screaming   baby .   they   make   a   great   gift   too ! !   everywhere   we   go   people   are   like   what   is   that   that   is   so   cool   i   have   never   seen   a   pacifier   like   that .   buy   it   you   won   t   be   sorry ! ! !
works   great ,   nothing   wrong   we   haven   t   had   any   problems   with   this ,   it   is   much   more   convenient   than   warming   up   a   bottle   using   the   stove .   i   also   like   that   the   cord   length   can   be   adjusted   so   you   can   have   just   as   much   as   you   need   on   your   countertop .

brilliant ,   and   adorable !   i   recieved   my   first   wubbanub   when   my   son   was   in   the   nicu   after   being   born ,   he   was   a   month   and   a   half   premature ,   and   they   gave   them   these   pacifiers   because   they   could   be   positioned   to   not   fall   out   of   their   little   mouths ,   and   the   weight   of   the   plush   animals ,   provided   comfort .   after   we   got   home ,   our   dog   got   ahold   of   the   wubbanub ,   and   tore   it   up .   it   was   a   looooong   night ,   it   is   the   only   pacifier   my   son   would   take !   i   searched   all   over   the   internet   looking   for   replacements ,   and   finally   came   across   some .   these   are   great   for   the   car   too ,   because   if   they   drop   them   in   their   carseat ,   they   can   usually   grab   it   and   put   it   back   in   their   mouth .   now , i   only   wish   they   made   them   with   the   super   soothies !   if   you   know   someone   who   is   expecting   this   is   a   great ,   unique   gift ,   that   they   won   t   even   know   how   much   they   will   love ! !
baby   was   not   impressed   my   breastfeed   baby   didn   t   care   for   this   pacifier   at   all .   really   wish   she   would   have   liked   it ,   but   no   dice .   i   have   tried   nearly   ever   pacifier   out   there   and   this   was   the   one   she   disliked   the   most .
wonderfully   calming   our   son   was   born   in   germany ,   and   someone   sent   us   one   of   these   womb   bears .   i   and   the   entire   staff   of   the   newborn   nursery   were   totally   shocked   when   the   sound   was   piped   in   over   the   intercom   to   the   newborn   nursery   and   the   entire   place   settled   into   blissful   sleep   within   about   45   seconds .   i   always   give   these   as   a   shower   gift   since   then .   it   certainly   saved   our   sleep .   however ,   it   is   important   to   note   they   seem   to   work   only   for   about   the   first   90   days   after   birth .
i   m   happy   with   them .   i   gave   them   as   a   gift .   they   are   a   fun   and   family   likes   them .   they   were   priced   well   at   amazon   and   the   store   that   shipped   them   handled   my   issues   quickly   with   no   errors .   i   would   recommend   them .
baby   loves   it ! ! !   our   baby   began   using   the   soothie   as   soon   as   she   got   home   from   the   hospital   and   loves   it .   it   is   hilarious   to   watch   her   little   mouth   work !   everyone   laughs   when   they   see   it   for   the   first   time .   i   have   no   problems   breastfeeding   but   i   also   don   t   believe   in   nipple   confusion   b   c   she   eats   from   bottles   since   day   one ,   and   breastfeeds ,   and   sucks   the   soothie   .   i   think   that   some   babies   may   be   more   particular   than   others   because   mine   also   uses   mam   and   advent   pacies   when   we   can   t   find   the   soothie .   i   think   these   are   a   good   deal   and   are   fun   because   you   can   put   your   finger   inside   and   feel   the   mouth   working .
the   best   pacifier   my   son   was   a   preemie ,   and   the   nicu   gave   him   the   gumdrop   preemie   and   full   term   pacifier   to   use   during   his   long   hospitalization   he   absolutely   loved   it !   designed   by   a   medical   company ,   and   made   of   hospital   grade   silicone ,   the   gumdrop   is   lightweight ,   very   soft ,   and   features   a   unibody   construction ,   so   there   are   no   parts   that   can   come   loose .   the   shape   of   the   pacifier   allowed   him   and   all   the   other   preemies   in   the   nicu   to   use   it   in   the   side   lying   position ,   even   with   all   his   tubes   i . e .   cpap ,   nasal   cannula ,   nasal   gavage   tube ,   etc .   .   you   can   put   your   finger   in   the   open   end ,   allowing   you   to   easily   control   or   hold   the   pacifier   it   also   allows   you   to   feel   how   strong   your   baby   s   suck   is .   nns   non   nutritive   sucking   is   very   important   for   a   baby   s   development ,   and   our   baby   got   to   practice   a   lot   of   nns   with   his   gumdrop .   it   helped   him   to   self   soothe   himself   as   well   when   we   couldn   t   be   at   his   cribside .   following   his   discharge ,   i   have   purchased   two   full   term   mango   colored   pacifiers   for   his   use .   the   company   has   since   introduced   full   term   pink   and   blue   colored   pacifiers ,   but   i   would   purchase   the   mango   colour   again .   overall ,   i   highly   recommend   this   product .   the   price   is   great ,   although   the   s   h   charges   are   high .
this   is   funny   and   people   love   it   ! ! !   i   bought   this   for   my   son   and   people   love   it !   i   am   asked   all   the   time   where   i   bought   it   from   cuz   they   want   to   get   it   for   their   grandchild ,   niece ,   nephew ... ect   i   often   think   amazon   should   pay   me   for   the   amount   of   word   of   mouth   i   have   given   on   this   product ...   i   think   if   you   have   a   sense   of   humor   and   don   t   see   it   as   some   slam   against   humanity   as   some   reviewer   has   than   you   ll   love   it ,   i   think   if   you   do   have   a   problem   with   it   you   probably   aren   t   even   bothering   looking   at   the   product   page   and   or   its   reviews .
baby   monitor   review   this   product   is   great   and   easy   to   use .   this   is   the   second   one   i   purchased   for   the   second   grandbaby .   i   was   a   bit   disappointed   in   the   fact   that   as   i   was   shopping   at   target ,   i   found   the   exact   same   thing   for   30   less   and   whould ,   of   course ,   not   had   the   shipping   charge .
sturdy   seat   great   rugged   infant   car   seat ,   but   it   does   have   a   few   problems .   it   s   really   heavy   if   you   ever   use   the   seat   outside   of   the   car .   the   little   head   tsip   true   side   impace   protection   piece   keeps   falling   down ,   last   of   all ,   adjusting   the   handle   is   difficult   as   the   latches   on   each   side   really   require   a   good   pull .   if   you   have   large   access   car   doors   and   plan   to   leave   the   seat   in   your   car   attached   to   the   base ,   it   s   a   great   safe   seat .
good   but   could   be   better   my   daughter   likes   the   spinning   sun   and   then   two   toys   hanging   off   of   it .   she   isn   t   so   interested   in   the   mirror   but   she   doesn   t   tend   to   get   too   into   mirrors   in   general .   the   one   real   complaint   that   i   have   is   that   it   doesn   t   have   a   bottom   and   it   is   very   light .   since   it   is   light   and   doesn   t   have   a   bottom ,   my   daughter   can   easily   pull   it   over   and   then   therefore   cannot   actually   play   with   the   toy .   i   have   to   keep   setting   it   back   up   or   holding   it   in   place   for   her .
worth   a   thousand   stars   this   product   deserves   a   thousand   stars !   i   can   t   even   find   words   to   describe   my   gratitude   for   it .   if   you   have   a   difficult   baby ,   you   must   get   this   swing !   after   half   a   day   or   night   of   consoling   my   baby ,   my   back   is   too   aching   to   keep   holding   her .   i   would   feel   desperate   if   it   weren   t   for   knowing   that   i   can   always   put   her   in   this   swing   and   she   will   relax   and   go   to   sleep .   it   has   saved   our   lives !   not   all   babies   need   so   much   consoling ,   but   if   your   baby   happens   to   be   colicky ,   this   swing   will   become   your   most   precious   possession .   it   is   of   very   nice   quality   well   constructed   and   safe ,   with   comfortable   soft   lining .   and   it   works   really   well .   i   don   t   have   a   single   complaint   about   it .   also ,   the   sounds   console   baby   if   the   swinging   alone   doesn   t   work .   and   if   swinging   side   to   side   doesn   t   work ,   then   often   swinging   front   to   back   will   relax   baby .   it   s   amazing .   i   can   t   imagine   how   anyone   would   survive   colic   without   it .
satisfied   so   far !   i   ordered   this   after   having   a   conventional   bumper   that   continuosly   collapsed   and   would   not   stay   taut .   i   ordered   this   as   a   replacement   and   have   been   pleased .   i   have   a   convertible   crib   and   the   side   does   not   go   down   the   kind   that   turns   into   a   toddler   then   full   size   bed   .   not   only   is   it   safe   but   i   found   it   easy   to   install   and   it   stays   up   fine .   because   the   material   is   soft ,   it   will   give   if   baby   leans   on   it   but   it   goes   right   back   into   place .   i   think   it   is   a   great   safe   alternative   and   i   would   recommend   it   to   anyone   keeps   babies   legs   arms   and   pacifiers   in   ! ! ! ! !
excellent   trainer   i   would   recommend   this   product   to   everyone .   my   son   adapted   very   well   to   using   the   potty   seat .   much   easier   than   the   traditional   potty   trainer   that   tends   to   be   a   messy   clean   up .
my   son   can   t   live   without   product !   my   son   received   a   few   loveys   and   this   one   was   the   one   that   he   became   attached   to .   we   have   to   bring   it   everywhere   with   us .   it   really   helps   him   feel   comfortable   in   an   unfamiliar   place .   i   ve   washed   it   numerous   times   and   the   material   really   holds   up .   we   are   buying   2   more ,   in   case   he   looses   his   beloved   g   man   .   giraffe   rocks !
great   product   it   s   so   refreshing   to   find   a   sippy   cup   that   doesn   t   have   little   pieces   to   take   out   and   clean   separately   or   possibly   lose   .   this   is   a   great   cup ,   easy   to   clean   and   my   daughter   loves   the   princess   design .   great   purchase !
wonderful   product   we   enjoy   this   baby   monitor   very   much ,   as   it   picks   up   on   sounds   very   well .   the   quality   of   sound   is   very   good .   we   put   it   a   little   further   away   from   the   baby ,   but   the   device   still   picks   up   on   her   crying   very   well .   we   also   love   the   fact   that   it   chooses   it   s   own   frequency ,   so   that   you   know   only   you   can   hear   your   baby ,   no   neighbors   can   listen   in .   the   night   light   is   a   bit   weak   and   the   price   is   a   bit   high .   nevertheless ,   it   does   what   it   s   supposed   to   do   very   well   and   we   consider   it   a   wonderful   product ,   with   great   technology .
hours   of   entertainment !   i   ve   been   putting   my   son   on   this   mat   since   he   was   a   month   old   and   the   colours   and   sounds   endlessly   entertain   him .   he   plays   and   gives   his   parents   time   to   get   things   done   around   the   house   for   half   an   hour   at   a   time ,   and   the   mirror   encourages   him   to   push   his   head   up   during   tummy   time .   it   s   easily   washed ,   which   is   handy   because   i   almost   always   have   spit   up   on   it .   the   music   isn   t   too   loud   or   too   quiet ,   though   there   is   no   volume   control ,   and   the   batteries   don   t   last   very   long ,   but   then   again ,   my   son   insists   on   having   the   music   on   all   the   time   when   playing   on   it .   definitely   recommended   to   any   parent   desperate   for   a   little   time   to   get   things   done !
2007   monitor   better   than   2006   this   is   a   much   better   monitor   than   last   years   video   monitor .   the   screen   is   better ,   the   range   is   longer ,   and   the   colors   are   brighter .   i   still   has   limitations .   although   better   than   last   year   it   still   has   a   kinda   choppy   picture .
great   customer   service ,   bad   noise   suppression   we   ve   gone   through   2   of   these   monitors   and   it   is   a   great   concept   but   the   design   doesn   t   filter   interference   well .   we   have   a   wifi   network   in   the   house ,   no   portable   phones   and   unless   we   are   fairly   close   we   get   intermittent   loud   crackles ,   pops ,   static .   second   unit   was   a   bit   better   than   the   first ,   not   much .   their   customer   support   was   great ,   sent   out   a   second   unit   via   fedex   with   no   questions ,   nor   requesting   deposit ,   with   return   label   on   the   original .   if   you   have   a   non   network   house   might   work   but   for   us ,   forget   it .   i   m   trying   another   monitor   so   we   can   sleep   again .   this   thing   needs   a   re   design   and   their   fast   turnaround   in   sending   out   a   replacement   may   be   that   they   know   as   well .
a   little   wobbly   all   in   all ,   a   good   product .   am   using   it   is   a   changing   table   dresser .   not   as   sturdy   as   i   would   have   liked .   color   is   nice ,   finish   is   nice .   got   to   match   da   vinci   roxanne   crib   in   espresso .
excellent   double   jogging   stroller   the   stroller   glides   so   well   it   seems   to   encourage   you   to   move   faster .   the   canopies   have   multiple   positions   to   block   out   setting   or   rising   suns .   the   storage   below   doesn   t   accommodate   any   large   bags ,   though ,   there   is   plenty   of   room   for   loose   items .   the   twins   love   the   open   ride .   not   a   stroller   for   feeding   them   if   you   need   a   tray .
good   paci   this   is   my   son   s   favorite   pacifier   we   got   our   fist   one   at   the   hospital   .   i   believe   it   is   because   it   is   softer   than   most   other   brands .   my   only   complaints   with   this   pacifier   are   1   it   doesn   t   have   a   cover   i . e .   like   the   avent   ones   and   2   it   only   comes   in   orange   which   in   reality   is   an   unattractive   pinkish   flesh   color   .
wonderful ! !   a   life   saver !   i   bought   these   pacifiers   before   my   daughter   was   born ,   simply   because   i   thought   they   were   cute .   these   pacifiers   stay   in   her   mouth   better   than   any   others   we   ver   tried   and   she   loves   them !   we   ve   tried   other   brands   and   she   spits   them   out   or   can   t   hang   on   to   them   as   well ,   but   as   soon   as   we   give   her   one   of   these   pacifiers ,   she   calms   down   quickly .   however ,   i   would   definitely   make   sure   that   you   buy   the   knob   kind .   she   does   have   difficulty   hanging   on   to   the   nipple   on   the   one   that   has   the   handle   on   the   pacifier   the   kind   that   isn   t   the   knob   pacifier   .   we   love   these   pacifiers ! ! ! ! ! !
clearly   not   kid   or   parent   tested !   the   concept   is   good   for   the   3   in   1 ,   but   the   step   stool   portion   does   not   lock   into   the   potty   ring   base .   so   child   knocks   it   over   easily   and   a   pain   if   you   have   to   move   it .
good   chair   for   differently   abled !   i   bought   this   feeding   chair   for   my   youngest   because   i   was   tired   of   tripping   over   the   regular   high   chair   and   wanted   more   space   in   the   kitchen .   i   am   very   happy   with   it .   as   others   have   said ,   it   is   way   easier   to   clean   than   most   high   chairs   and   it   is   easy   to   adust   the   recline .   i   will   say   that   i   had   to   get   the   hang   of   using   the   recline ,   but   once   i   figured   it   out ,   it   s   a   breeze .   my   son   is   17   mo   and   he   isn   t   sitting   up   on   his   own   due   to   a   medical   condition .   he   can   feed   himself   and   so   he   needs   to   be   in   a   sitting   up   position ,   just   slightly   reclined .   i   needed   a   chair   that   had   a   high   enough   back   to   cradle   and   support   his   head ,   yet   one   that   was   lightweight   and   portable   enough   that   we   could   take   it   to   restaurants .   i   bought   the   fisher   price   healthy   care   booster   seat ,   too   and   the   back   wasn   t   high   enough   for   my   son   who   cannot   sit   up   yet .   that   chair   was   more   portable   because   it   folds ,   but   for   my   son ,   it   didn   t   work .   overall ,   this   chair   is   great   and   i   wish   i   had   known   about   it   with   my   first   child ,   too !
complaint   the   sheet   was   way   too   small   for   a   crib   size   mattress .   i   never   expected   that   so   had   thrown   away   box .   we   washed   and   dried   it   before   using   it   and   there   is   no   way   the   sheet   could   have   fit   any   crib   mattress
just   ok   unlike   the   other   reviewer ,   the   monitor   still   picks   up   the   white   noise   even   when   i   put   the   setting   on   sound   activation .   the   setting   works   for   maybe   2   mins .   and   then   once   the   baby   makes   a   noise   and   starts   up   the   monitor ,   it   just   stays   on ,   even   though   the   baby   is   no   longer   making   noise .   i   personally   don   t   like   the   sound   activation   setting   anyway   b   c   when   it   turns   on   and   off   it   makes   a   clicking   noise   which   in   itself   is   distracting   to   me .   the   other   problem   i   have   with   this   monitor   is   that   it   beeps   a   lot   for   the   range   alarm   .   we   have   tried   so   many   positions   and   it   still   does   it .   i   think   it   does   it   b   c   our   baby   moves   a   lot   in   the   crib   and   gets   further   and   further   away   from   the   monitor   so   when   she   makes   a   smaller   noise ,   the   monitor   can   t   pick   it   up   very   well   so   it   just   beeps   the   range   alarm   instead .   needless   to   say ,   this   beep   is   rather   annoying ,   especially   when   you   re   trying   to   sleep .   so   the   bottom   line   is   that   i   can   not   use   this   monitor   at   night .   i   only   use   it   during   the   day   when   baby   is   napping   and   i   am   doing   things   around   the   house .   i   have   never   tried   any   other   baby   monitors ,   so   i   can   t   comment   on   how   this   compares   to   other   ones .   i   got   this   one   as   a   shower   gift .   my   impression   is   that   this   one   is   on   the   pricier   end   of   baby   monitors .
very   poor   quality   i   purchased   two   of   these   mattresses   and   they   both   were   ripped   at   the   plastic   seams   exposing   the   foam   inside   the   mattress .   not   a   good   choice .
great   pacifier   the   hospital   i   have   my   children   at   uses   these .   it   seems   that   once   they   are   hooked ,   this   is   it !   the   only   problem   is   they   are   not   readily   available   to   purchase   like   the   bigger   brand   names .   they   also   have   no   place   to   put   the   clip   that   prevents   the   child   from   losing   it .   my   son   loves   these ,   however ,   i   can   t   seem   to   have   enough   of   them   because   he   drops   them ,   they   bounce   oh ,   yes ,   they   are   rubber   you   know   and   they   get   lost ! ! ! !
great   paci ,   definite   must   have !   my   great   husband   found   these   online   right   before   my   daughter   was   born ,   and   they   are   indispensable ! !   the   stuffed   animals   helped   to   keep   the   paci   from   falling   out   all   the   time ,   and   my   little   girl   loves   to   hold   them ,   even   when   she   was   a   newborn .   now   that   she   is   older ,   i   watch   her   at   night   when   she   wakes   up ,   she   feels   around ,   grabs   her   wubby   and   sticks   it   in   her   mouth ,   so   that   mommy   doesn   t   have   to   go   in   4 , 000x   a   night   to   stick   the   paci   back   in !   not   only   that ,   but   we   get   compliments   everywhere   we   go   from   people   asking   about   them ... they   are   so   darn   cute .   we   have   the   ponies   both   ,   the   kitten   and   the   duck .   the   duck   is   my   least   favorite   because   it   s   wings   make   it   hard   to   stand   up   next   to   your   baby   in   the   crib .   this   is   now   my   standard   baby   shower   gift   for   all   my   friends !
this   item   really   surprised   me   i   got   to   admit   that   i   was   kinda   reluctant   of   this   product   at   first ,   but   since   it   is   so   cute   we   couldn   t   help   it .   when   we   got   the   item   we   throughly   inspected   it   and   it   is   very   well   made .   the   plush   part   is   well   sewn   with   the   fillings   in   several   smaller   self   contained   parts   i . e .   the   leg   fillings   can   t   pass   on   other   parts   of   the   body   .   it   is   light   weight   but   not   too   light   either ,   if   you   put   it   on   the   baby   s   belly   it   will   stay   there .   the   baby   can   lift   it   with   no   problems   at   all .   br   br   the   soothie   pacifier   part   is   sewn   into   the   plush   so   it   won   t   come   apart .   it   has   a   large   ring   with   perforations   so   choke   hazard   is   really   none   existent .   br   br   my   only   complain   and   this   is   why   i   didn   t   give   it   5   starts   and   why   i   won   t   get   another   is   the   pacifier   part   has   a   very   small   profile .   description   says   from   0   to   6   months   but   the   tip   does   look   like   a   new   born   cicco   pacifier   in   size   and   our   baby   is   more   used   to   the   2   orthopedic   flat   profile ...   so   a   bigger   option   for   bigger   babies   would   ve   been   nice .   br   br   it   took   our   baby   like   5   seconds   to   figure   out   what   it   was   and   she   instantly   and   naturally   took   it   from   her   belly   and   self   inserted   it   in   her   mouth .   eventually   when   she   doesn   t   want   it   anymore   she   takes   it   off   and   plays   with   it ,   speaks   with   it ...   it   is   very   cute   indeed .   br   br   if   my   baby   were   smaller   say   1   3   months   i   d   get   at   least   3   or   4   more .   if   they   make   one   with   a   bigger   pacifier   tip   or   another   profile   count   me   in .
my   baby   did   not   like   this   i   started   out   trying   to   give   my   newborn   daughter   this   pacifier .   she   sucked   it   a   few   times   and   then   rejected   it .   i   was   hopeful   she   would   take   it   b   c   i   heard   such   good   things   about   it   and   how   it   is   supposed   to   be   the   best   pacifier   for   breast   fed   babies   to   avoid   nipple   confusion .   in   the   end ,   my   daughter   took   the   gerber   nuk   for   about   a   month   and   then   refused   all   pacifiers   all   together .   just   as   well   since   they   say   to   wean   them   off   around   4   6   months   anyway .
pacifiers   for   recent   born   i   think   itll   be   good ,   these   are   very   tiny ,   ill   be   able   to   say   when   my   baby   starts   using   them .   i   think   the   idea   of   the   case   is   very   good   and   very   handy .
won   t   shut   off   after   just   a   handful   of   uses !   we   bought   this   on   a   saturday ...   we   used   it   for   the   first   time   on   sunday   morning .   we   only   used   it ,   maybe   2   3   times   per   day .   we   unplugged   it   after   each   use .   went   to   warm   up   a   bottle   on   wednesday   evening   and   the   switch   glows   red   permanently   now ,   which   means   it   does   not   beep   or   turn   off .   we   haven   t   touched   it   since   then ...   it   technically   still   works ,   but   not   properly .   i   m   ticked ,   because   we   didn   t   use   this   much   at   all   and   were   very   careful   with   it ,   yet   it   still   died   out   on   us .   br   br   my   daughter   prefers   her   bottles   warmed ,   so   we   are   going   to   invest   in   another   warmer ,   but   so   far ,   not   sure   on   the   brand ...   especially   since   this   one   was   highly   recommended .
skip   hop   when   i   purchased   this   product ,   i   was   expecting   to   be   able   to   have   a   couple   of   clean   pacifiers   that   would   be   easy   to   get   to ,   especially   while   on   the   go .   well ,   it   does   keep   the   pacifiers   clean ,   but   it   doesn   t   stay   snapped   to   the   bag   or   whatever   it   s   attached   to .   i   still   have   to   keep   it   in   the   bag   so   that   i   don   t   lose   the   whole   thing .   great   idea ,   good   product .   just   needs   a   stronger   snap .
this   is   the   best !   there   is   not   a   cuter ,   more   durable   pacifier   chain   out   there   than   haba   s   pacifier   chain !   thank   goodness   i   happened   to   be   at   the   baby   store   buying   a   much   cheaper   elmo   clip   ,   when   i   noticed   the   mother   and   baby   in   line   behind   me .   her   baby   was   playing   with   this   totally   adorable   pacifier   chain ,   and   thankfully   the   mom   gave   me   the   info .   i   raced   home ,   got   online ,   and   ordered   two .   i   have   received   many   compliments   on   my   unique   find !
i   love   these   and   need   more   when   my   babies   had   their   portraits   taken   one   of   them   really   wanted   his   pacifier .   because   it   s   clear   it   looked   beautiful   in   the   photo .   he   loves   his   pacifier   so   it   made   sense   in   the   photo   and   didnt   detract   from   the   look   at   all .   it   actually   made   him   look   very   sweet
just   what   i   expected .   nothing   exciting   here ,   just   a   pacifier   holder .   it   goes   with   my   bag   so   i   thought   it   would   be   a   decent   addition   as   well   as   a   bonus   when   i   go   to   resell   the   bag .   br   br   however ,   although   it   performs   as   expected   i . e . ,   holds   a   pacifier   ,   the   snap   seems   to   be   just   loose   enough   that   it   will   pop   off   if   not   located   inside   the   bag .   i   was   hoping   to   get   this   to   attach   to   the   outside   so   i   wouldn   t   have   to   dig   for   pacifiers .   if   i   sling   the   bag   over   my   shoulder   and   my   body   rubs   against   the   pacifier   pocket ,   it   will   unsnap   and   fall   on   the   ground .   br   br   granted ,   the   pacifier   is   still   clean   and   in   the   bag ... hence   the   4   star   rating   instead   of   lower .
would   be   great   except   for   snap   it   s   a   nice   pouch   and   holds   1   2   pacifiers .   however ,   the   snap   keeps   coming   undone .   it   s   intended   to   be   hooked   onto   a   diaper   bag   or   purse ,   so   it   s   pretty   important   that   it   stays   put !
better   than   all   the   rest !   this   is   the   best   pacifier   out   there   for   breastfed   babies   or   babies   who   will   only   take   the   one   from   the   hospital .   my   son   wouldn   t   take   any   other   pacifier   but   the   one   from   the   hospital .   i   tried   every   kind .   this   pacifier   is   amazing   because   it   creates   a   sucking   motion   like   that   during   breastfeeding .   i   buy   them   in   bulk !   i   would   not   use   any   other   kind   for   my   child .
great   audio   video   monitor   the   monitor   works   good .   both ,   sound   and   picture   are   great   when   you   stay   within   the   range .   automatic   night   vision   feature   is   great .   microphone   has   good   sensitivity .   however ,   at   the   distance   over   30   feet   through   the   walls ,   the   receiver   starts   to   pick   up   some   static ,   which   affects   both   video   and   sound .   it   would   be   nice   if   the   receiver   could   turn   the   video   on   automatically   if   the   sound   level   stays   high   for   a   couple   seconds .   br   br   we   are   very   satisfied   with   the   purchase   but   the   static   in   the   far   rooms   of   the   house   make   me   give   it   4   stars .
dangerous   seat   do   not   buy !   this   seat   cannot   be   installed   rear   facing   correctly .   our   daughter   nearly   tipped   over   in   it .   also   the   head   rest   pushes   her   head   into   her   chest   and   the   shoulder   pads   are   so   bulkly   that   no   matter   how   tightly   you   adjust   the   shoulder   straps   she   can   still   wiggle   out   of   the   seat .   she   is   so   uncomfortable   that   she   cries   every   time   we   go   somewhere .   we   have   had   to   put   her   back   into   her   carrier   seat   since   we   have   returned   this   one   and   are   now   shopping   for   something   else .   this   seat   is   dangerous ... do   not   buy !
good   option   for   the   price   fit   for   mediumish   jogger   this   was   a   bargain   at   10   bucks .   we   have   a   jeep   3   wheeler   that   is   rather   large   and   bulky .   this   cover   just   barely   fits ,   but   i   expected   as   much   based   on   the   model   stroller   in   the   photo .   beware   if   you   have   a   true   jogging   stroller   that   is   large   and   or   long .   it   helps   that   it   has   velcro   for   at   the   front   wheel   end   to   help   it   stay   secure   but   not   vented   .   it   s   easy   to   install   and   folds   fairly   easily .
my   family   and   i   love   this   product ! !   we   all   fall   asleep   to   the   combo   sound   of   ocean   waves   and   thunder ! !   very   relaxing   indeed !   i   bring   with   me   when   we   travel !
ick   i   will   first   say ... this   is   a   cute   stroller .   the   colors   are   actually   quite   nice   in   person ,   though   they   are   a   bit   drab   on   my   computer   screen .   and   if   you   re   only   pushing   it   around   your   kitchen   on   tiles ,   it   s   quite   nice .   however ,   after   the   return   period ,   we   had   a   chance   to   try   it   out   on   sidewalks   it   was   purchased   solely   for   a   disneyland   trip   so   we   didn   t   have   to   rent   a   stroller   and   so   i   wasn   t   tempted   to   try   to   bring   my   smooth   riding   jogging   stroller   aka   the   beast   ,   so   this   sidewalk   trial   was   important !   .   before   we   got   a   block   away   from   our   apartment   i   knew   we   would   be   selling   it .   i   m   only   5   3   and   i   was   kicking   the   tires   with   every   step   i   took .   if   i   tried   to   lean   so   i   didn   t   kick   it ,   then   my   body   was   in   a   ridiculous   position   that   would   have   hurt   my   back   inside   of   just   one   day   at   disneyland .   my   husband   is   5   10   and   kicked   it   too ,   of   course .   that   s   not   fun   for   the   kicker   or   the   kid   inside   the   stroller .   it   was   very   rough   riding   as   well .   and   i   couldn   t   pop   it   up   onto   curbs ,   because   when   i   did   the   motion   to   get   it   up   onto   its   back   wheels ,   it   pulled   up   on   the   handles   which   is   what   you   do   to   make   it   fold !   now   there   might   have   been   some   sort   of   lock   that   i   didn   t   find   despite   reading   the   instructions   that   would   keep   it   from   doing   that ,   but   by   that   time   i   was   over   this   stroller .   i   cleaned   it   up   from   a   short   sidewalk   walk ,   the   wheels   looked   awful ,   b   c   they   are   just   plastic ,   not   tires   at   all   ,   consigned   it ,   and   was   glad   it   was   gone .
you   get   what   you   pay   for   we   bought   the   most   expensive   non   tv   baby   monitor   at   our   local   r   us   store .   it   cracked   and   popped   constantly   drove   my   husband   nuts .   we   decided   that   the   price   was   worth   it   and   bought   the   phillips .   we   love   this   monitor   and   cannot   recommend   it   highly   enough .   we   love   the   walkie   talkie   feature   so   that   if   my   husband   can   t   find   something   in   the   nusery   i   can   respond   without   having   to   get   up   and   go   find   it   for   him .   nothing   at   r   us   even   compares   we   are   very   happy ! !
only   works   with   1   style   of   medela   bra   i   was   so   excited   to   pump   hands   free   but   close   inspection   of   the   box   revealed   that   it   only   works   with   beautiful   beginnings   style   bra   bogus !   you   need   a   bunch   of   loops   in   your   bra ,   and   none   of   my   other   medela   bras   or   otherwise   have   them   make   sure   you   have   the   right   bra   first !
nice   and   sturdy   really   nice   but   won   t   work   with   the   evenflo   comfort   select   pump   unless   you   use   batteries   because   the   adapter   gets   in   the   way   of   the   ac   power   cord .   comes   with   12   cups   and   lids .
good   product   but   could   improve   i   have   this   in   purple   and   i   like   it ,   is   roomy ,   not   so   bulky ,   nice   color ,   easy   to   assemble .   what   i   d   like   it   to   have   is   a   couple   of   front   or   side   pockets   for   small   toys   or   books   so   my   toddler   doesn   t   have   to   open   the   lid   to   reach   everything .   i   haven   t   washed   it   but   i   hope   it   s   not   big   deal .
great   seat !   if   it   fits !   i   was   thrilled   to   find   a   seat   that   i   could   use   for   my   4   year   old !   i   felt   very   uneasy   about   putting   her   in   a   booster ,   because ,   even   though   it   s   legal ,   it   s   not   as   safe   as   a   harness ! !   the   fact   that   this   seat   is   so   narrow   is   a   great   thing   for   me   because   i   drive   a   very   small   car   and   need   to   save   room   where   i   can !   i   have   had   great   customer   service   from   sunshine   kids   reguarding   this   seat .   my   emails   have   been   returned   promtly   and   my   question   have   all   been   answered .   i   will   say   that   i   only   gave   it   4   stars   because   i   have   not   been   able   to   install   it   in   every   car   i   have   tried .   so   please   be   sure   you   buy   from   somewhere   you   can   return   it ,   just   in   case !
love   it   we   had   a   resistant   learner .   this   was   the   only   thing   that   made   him   feel   comfortable .   it   was   comfortable   and   didn   t   leak .
outdated   version   sent   twice   i   have   ordered   this   carseat   and   when   it   arrived   it   was   the   old   version   without   the   gracopedic   foam ,   3x   more   eps   foam ,   and   no   travel   pillow .   i   called   and   they   sent   out   another   seat .   same   outdated   seat   sent .   i   will   not   compromise   my   angels   safety .   if   graco   added   more   eps   foam ,   then   the   booster   needed   it .   i   want   the   item   very   badly ,   but   i   want   it   as   described ,   with   the   new   advances .
awesome   this   is   the   only   paci   that   my   baby   will   take   and   actually   keep .   for   some   reason   he   really   likes   the   soothie .   this   is   a   great   product   and   it   makes   such   a   cute   baby   shower   gift .
great   idea ... not   so   great   quality   i   was   very   happy   with   the   sidekick   diaper   bag   at   first .   it   has   lots   of   handy   pockets   and   is   cleverly   designed   with   the   carrier   inside .   it   is   very   practical ,   but   very   poor   quality .   within   one   week ,   the   first   zipper   broke   on   the   bottom   of   the   bag .   then   a   couple   months   later   another   zipper   broke   completely   off .   now ,   the   main   zipper   i   use   the   most   to   keep   my   keys   in ,   gets   stuck   shut   all   the   time   and   won   t   open   until   you   try   over   and   over   and   over .   i   bought   this   bag   on   sale   for   45   and   i   m   not   sure   it   was   worth   even   that .   now ,   just   2   months   later ,   i   m   looking   for   a   new   bag   because   of   the   cheaply   made   zippers ! !   very   dissappointing ! !   why   do   they   charge   79   for   this   bag   and   then   put   the   poorest   quality   of   zippers   inside   think   twice   before   ordering ...
a   blessing   from   the   stars   above !   i   bought   two   of   these ,   one   for   my   4   year   old   son   and   one   for   my   1.5   year   old   daughter .   i   commend   myself   for   this   purchase   because   both   my   children   love   their   twilight   turtle .   it   has   become   a   part   of   their   bedtime   routine .   not   only   is   it   educational   but   it   is   also   of   quality   construction .   the   turtle   s   body   parts   are   so   soft   that   my   toddler   loves   running   her   hands   over   them .   and   the   twilight   turtle   is   also   able   to   withstand   a   great   pounding   because   my   daughter   also   loves   to   throw   it   around   and   knock   on   different   objects   with   its   shell .   believe   it   or   not ,   it   hasn   t   even   chipped   and   it   still   functions   as   is   expected .   well   worth   the   money .   i   highly   recommend   this   to   anyone   looking   for   a   night   light   which   gives   the   child   comfort   and   as   the   child   grows   older   and   more   cognizant   the   turtle   becomes   multi   functional   because   it   is   also   educational .   it   is   fun   pointing   out   the   constellations   to   my   4   year   old   son .
love   this   product ! !   first ,   i   don   t   agree   with   the   reviewer   that   said   that   it   doesn   t   go   through   bag   screening .   i   went   from   madison ,   wi   to   honolulu   and   to   kona   and   back   with   absolutely   no   problems .   and   that   included   2   small   regional   airports .   i   have   a   britax   marathon   carseat .   this   worked   like   a   breeze   for   our   trip ... our   first   one   with   our   14   month   old ... and   yes   we   picked   hawaii   nuts ,   i   know   .   anyway ,   we   left   the   cart   on   for   the   shorter   flights   but   removed   it   for   the   minneapolis   to   honolulu   leg .   most   of   our   flights   with   first   class ,   we   did   have   one   leg   in   coach ... and   i   would   not   recommend   keeping   the   cart   on   if   flying   coach   in   less   you   have   the   bulkhead   row   or   no   one   sitting   in   from   of   your   child .   our   son   was   able   to   easily   kick   the   seat   in   front ,   but   only   when   the   car   was   on .   plus ,   it   makes   the   car   seat   sit   up   really   straight ,   so   our   son   was   uncomfortable   until   after   take   off   when   we   could   tilt   his   seat   back .   but ,   if   you   do   have   to   take   the   cart   off ,   but   practice   at   home   a   couple   times   and   it   is   really   easy .   i   can   put   the   cart   back   together   in   a   matter   of   a   few   minutes ... the   same   amount   of   time   that   you   would   have   to   wait   anyway   to   get   a   stroller   back   from   gate   check !
good   pad   quite   expensive   for   what   it   is   but   it   s   nice   and   thick ,   good   quality   and   fits   my   non   standard   mattress   well   without   turning   it   into   a   banana   my   mattress   is   about   an   inch   bigger   all   round   than   standard   size   so   it   s   worth   the   extra   few   bucks .
fantastic !   a   must   have !   we   love   this   product .   we   actually   have   this   in   addition   to   a   travel   system ,   but   we   use   this   far   more   often .   it   even   has   more   storage   in   the   bottom   basket   than   the   larger   travel   system   stroller .   it   weighs   far   less   than   the   travel   system   stroller ,   and   takes   up   less   space   in   the   trunk .   we   use   it   in   restaurants   frequently !   the   slings   that   restaurants   provide   take   up   much   more   space   than   this   item !   plus ,   this   item   is   much   more   stable   than   a   restaurant   sling   that   could   topple   if   bumped .   the   push   bar   can   be   dropped   for   added   space   saving !
nice   seat ,   good   value   i   was   a   little   hesitant   with   purchasing   this   car   seat   because   i   bought   it   for   like   60   at   sam   s   club .   however ,   i   have   been   pleasantly   surprised   with   its   quality .   i   started   putting   my   daughter   in   it   at   about   5   or   6   months   and   she   fit   very   nicely .   it   seemed   cozy .   she   is   now   almost   one   and   soon   we   will   be   switching   her   around   and   i   m   interested   in   how   it   will   work   facing   forward .   the   seat   is   really   simple   to   readjust   for   height   and   weight   as   the   baby   gets   older .   pretty   easy   clean   up   too .   some   cons   i   do   have   if   you   don   t   have   the   latch   system ,   all   of   the   buckles   are   really   annoying   and   get   in   the   way .   i   had   to   kind   of   rig   them   all   together .   when   the   seat   is   facing   forward ,   there   is   no   easy   way ,   without   rebuckling   to   recline   the   seat   for   sleeping .   it   is   on   the   large   bulky   side   and   barely   fits   in   my   vw   passat .   the   front   seats   cannot   go   all   the   way   back   when   the   car   seat   is   rear   facing .   i   do   a   lot   of   in   and   out   of   other   vehicles   with   the   seat   and   it   is   rather   bulky   to   carry   around .
ridesafer   travel   vest   alternative   to   booster   seat   we   are   expecting   our   third   child   soon   and   began   to   experiment   with   placing   a   third   car   seat   in   the   back   of   our   vibe   and   scion   xb   vehicles .   unfortunately ,   at   about   18   inches   width   per   car   seat ,   the   51   52   inch   car   seat   width   is   extremely   borderline .   you   can   get   them   in   snug ,   but   good   luck   getting   your   hand   in   there   to   buckle   the   booster   seat .   i   ve   also   never   liked   where   the   belts   cross   my   son   s   neck   and   stomach .   the   ridesafer   travel   vest   takes   up   much   less   room   when   used   without   a   booster   seat .   i   like   that   it   routes   the   shoulder   and   lap   belts   to   the   correct   location .   do   not   expect   your   child   to   be   able   to   secure   or   remove   himself ,   however .   the   belts   must   be   properly   routed   through   the   guides   and   the   tether   in   place   of   or   in   addition   to   the   shoulder   belt   must   be   fastened .   the   buttons   on   the   vest   themselves   are   too   stiff   to   be   pressed   by   the   child   as   well   safe ,   but   inconvenient   .   when   fastened   correctly ,   i   think   the   vest   even   without   the   booster   seat   appears   to   be   safer   than   using   a   harness   less   booster   seat .   if   i   leave   the   tether   attached ,   i   can   secure   my   son   in   less   than   a   minute .   except   for   the   vest   buttons ,   he   can   get   himself   out   of   the   vest   and   leave   it   dangling   from   the   tether   ready   for   his   return .   i   think   instead   of   leaving   the   vest   with   the   babysitter ,   i   ll   buy   a   second   one   for   the   other   vehicle .   in   any   case ,   it   s   much   cheaper   than   buying   a   new   car !   if   anyone   can   provide   more   information   on   the   safety   issues   of   using   the   vest   without   a   booster ,   please   let   me   know .   to   me ,   it   feels   safer   than   using   a   booster   without   the   vest !   in   the   mean   time ,   i   ll   rate   it   a   5   for   safety   and   a   3   for   ease   of   use   and   a   5   for   space   saving .

the   best   shopping   cart   cover   period   it   covers   everything   even   for   my   very   active   son   ,   plus   i   easily   installed   it   with   one   hand   on   the   first   try .   love   it ! ! !
convenient   none   available .
i   love   this   monitor ! ! !   we   purchased   this   monitor   when   we   found   out   that   our   preemie   son   would   finally   be   going   off   his   apnea   monitor .   it   was   then   that   we   realized   that   we   wouldn   t   be   able   to   sleep   at   night   without   it !   this   monitor   has   given   us   peace   of   mind .   it   s   worked   perfectly   since   we   ve   gotten   it ,   and   we   ve   had   no   false   alarms   in   the   3   months   since   we   ve   been   using   it .   it   also   works   great   for   travel .   we   put   the   movement   sensor   on   the   bottom   of   his   pack   n   play   right   above   the   crossbars   and   below   the   mattress .   as   the   parent   of   a   preemie   who   got   spoiled   at   night   by   the   apnea   monitor ,   this   is   the   next   best   thing !   this   is   worth   the   price   just   for   the   movement   sensor !
broke   after   one   week .   i   enjoyed   this   monitor ,   until   the   parent   unit   broke   after   one   week .   it   stopped   picking   up   noise   from   the   baby   suddenly ,   without   any   explanation .   quality   control   anyone  
great   product ,   but   a   little   noisy   this   is   a   great   product .   it   is   very   light   weight   and   portable ,   easy   to   use ,   and   a   space   saver !   the   only   drawback   is   that   it   s   a   bit   loud .   it   makes   a   clicking   sound   similiar   to   the   old   school   swings   that   you   needed   to   wind .
i   love   these   diaper   sacks !   i   use   these   diaper   sacks   everyday   several   times   a   day .   i   have   two   little   ones   in   diapers   and   all   poopy   ones   go   right   into   one   of   these   bags   and   then   walked   to   the   garbage   outside .   i   also   keep   several   in   the   diaper   bag   not   just   for   dirty   diapers ,   but   also   for   little   clothes   that   get   messy .   i   find   they   are   the   perfect   size   and   they   have   a   nice   scent   too .   i   love   this   box   because   they   dispense   easily   and   sit   right   next   to   the   wipes   on   my   kids   changing   table .
easy   set   up ,   works   great ,   day   or   night   i   purchased   this   a   few   weeks   ago   for   monitoring   in   the   bedroom   during   daytime   naps   or   during   the   night   so   that   i   could   watch   and   hear   what   was   going   on .   this   set   up   in   a   snap   mounting   to   a   wall   or   sitting   on   a   table   ,   and   gets   great   reception   in   most   parts   of   the   house .   as   compare   to   the   alternative   in   this   price   range   the   saftey   1st   brand   ,   this   worked   perfect   out   of   the   box .   the   saftey   1st   one   did   not   broadcast   as   well ,   and   the   montior   had   a   permanent   roll   to   it   despite   playing   with   the   v   hold   knob   constantly   .   worth   the   investment   for   security   and   assurance .   this   is   the   brand   to   buy .
drenched   baby   i   bought   these   bottles   thinking   my   son   could   hold   them   better   because   they   are   wide ,   but   the   nipple   pushes   into   the   bottle   over   half   the   time   and   soaks   my   son   no   matter   how   tight   you   put   on   the   lid .   don   t   recommend   anyone   buy   these !
toilet   trainer   dont   really   like   this   one ,   it   is   to   hard   for   him   to   get   on ,   and   the   part   for   the   boy   doesnt   work   well .   disappointed   for   the   price .
good   seat   it   s   a   neat   seat .   i   have   them   side   by   side   and   the   wife   sits   back   there   also .   i   wish   the   top   was   a   little   bit   narrower .   this   seat   is   more   than   20   lbs .   it   s   heavy
find   some   other   alternate !   this   item   is   useless   for   an   infant .   once   our   son   s   cord   fell   off ,   and   it   was   time   for   a   bath ,   we   put   this   chair   in   the   tub .   we   had   to   fill   the   tub   nearly   3   4   of   the   way   for   water   to   even   reach   half   way   up   the   chair .   then   it   started   to   float !   we   attempted   to   put   our   son   on   it   and   he   just   slid   down   and   off   of   it !   it   is   impossible   for   only   one   person   to   use   this   item ,   unless   you   are   content   with   giving   your   child   a   sponge   bath   in   the   open   air !
great   for   teething .   i   prefer   this   mesh   feeder   to   the   munchkin   brand .   this   one   is   larger   and   easier   to   clean .   i   don   t   really   like   to   put   food   in   it .   i   freeze   unsweetened   applesauce   in   a   ice   cube   tray ,   then   pop   one   into   the   mesh .   my   son   loves   them ,   especially   when   he   is   teething .
light   weight   plastic   and   not   tall   enough   i   bought   this   for   my   baby   brother ,   jay .   he   is   my   mom   s   1   year   old   foster   child   who   she   is   in   the   process   of   adopting .   here   is   what   my   mom   said   about   the   gate   br   br   the   gate   seemed   ok   but   was   very   light   weight   plastic   and   we   didn   t   think   it   was   sturdy   enough   to   keep   a   strong   baby   like   jay   from   breaking   it   out   of   the   wall   and   then   tumbling   with   it   down   the   steps .   most   importantly ,   the   gate   was   not   very   tall ,   only   about   24   i   think ,   the   railing   around   the   top   of   the   steps   is   more   like   32   .   we   felt   that   baby   would   be   hanging   over   the   top   of   the   gate   and   fall   down   the   steps   jay   is   already   33   inches   tall   .   br   br   they   ended   up   buying   a   different   gate ,   so   it   was   a   waste   of   money   for   me .   if   i   lived   in   the   same   state ,   i   would   just   bring   it   home   to   use   in   my   house   for   my   baby   since   we   don   t   have   any   stairs .
don   t   buy   this !   i   made   the   mistake   of   getting   this   one   and   it   really   does   nothing .   i   would   have   more   success   asking   my   newborn   to   blow   her   nose   into   a   tissue   while   doing   a   handstand .   save   your   money   and   buy   a   different   aspirator .
great   high   chair   at   a   great   price   i   am   very   pleased   with   the   purchase   of   the   fisher   price   space   saver   high   chair .   it   is   compact   without   being   too   small   and   it   has   all   the   features   i   was   looking   for   in   a   high   chair   dishwasher   safe   tray ,   reclining   seat   and   a   seat   cover   that   can   be   wiped   clean .   it   attached   to   my   dining   room   chair   easily   and   can   also   easily   be   removed   if   the   chair   is   needed   for   a   dinner   guest .   i   would   absolutely   recommend   this   product .
i   wanted   to   love   it ...   i   love   the   look   of   this   diaper   bag ,   because   it   doesn   t   look   like   a   diaper   bag .   the   outer   pockets   are   great   for   things   like   keys ,   wallets   and   cell   phones .   the   main   compartment   is   somewhat   narrow ,   but   deep .   the   denim   fabric   is   sturdy   and   wears   well   after   four   months   of   heavy   use ,   it   still   looks   practically   new .   i   don   t   find   this   as   roomy   as   i   d   like ,   and   i   should   add   that   i   try   to   be   a   minimalist   and   not   bring   the   kitchen   sink   whenever   we   go   out .   getting   standard   things   like   diapers ,   a   couple   outfits ,   a   small   toy   and   an   insulated   bottle   bag   into   the   main   compartment   can   be   difficult .   also ,   it   can   be   hard   to   find   smaller   items   that   may   not   have   fit   into   the   side   pockets .   the   stroller   bag   feature   is   great ,   but   it   can   be   tricky   to   remove   the   main   strap   and   utilize   the   smaller   straps .   overall ,   i   like   this   bag   but   will   probably   trade   it   in   for   something   a   little   bigger .
very   satisfied   my   wife   just   used   this   for   the   first   time   when   flying   with   our   daughter   from   the   us   to   the   uk .   she   couldn   t   be   happier .   it   did   need   to   be   detached   from   the   car   seat   in   order   to   go   through   the   x   ray   machine ,   but   that   was   simple   as   it   is   easy   to   take   apart   and   re   attach .   it   is   convenient   to   not   have   to   take   the   child   out   of   the   seat   when   changing   planes .   it   also   seemed   very   comfortable   for   our   daughter .
best   baby   bag   although   there   are   less   expensive   baby   bags   available ,   the   lullabag   is   definitely   worth   the   extra   money .   the   double   zipper   is   a   must   have   and   is   worth   every   penny   it   makes   nighttime   diaper   changes   so   much   easier .   also ,   the   weight   of   the   cotton   bag   is   perfect   for   the   summer   months   or   warm   climates .   the   quality   is   superb !
worth   the   peace   of   mind   i   would   say   the   summer   video   monitor   is   worth   the   price .   my   daughter   is   just   starting   to   roll   over   in   her   crib   and   this   way   we   can   keep   an   eye   on   her .   the   picture   isn   t   absolutely   the   clearest   picture   ever ,   but   it   works .   if   it   gets   staticy   i   can   usually   just   adjust   the   power   cord   and   it   clears   right   up .   the   handheld   piece   is   very   convient   for   carrying   around   the   house   and   the   small   camera   piece   is   easy   to   move   around   as   well .   all   in   all ,   i   would   recommend   this   product .
great   buy ! ! !   i   bought   this   for   my   3month   old   and   our   pacifier   problems   are   over ! ! !   it   works   perfect   and   is   much   better   looking   than   all   the   others .
excellent   product   i   like   the   gate .   it   works   perfect   for   keeping   our   dog   out   of   area   that   we   do   not   want   her   in
good   for   travel   this   is   a   good   product   for   traveling .   we   have   a   child   that   always   falls   out   of   bed   and   wanted   something   that   is   easy   to   pack   and   take   with   us .   this   serves   the   purpose   but   it   moves   very   easily   and   comes   off   the   bed   without   much   effort .   it   did   prevent   my   little   one   from   falling   out   of   bed .   i   do   like   the   hard   railings   you   tuck   under   the   mattress   better   but   this   product   is   easier   to   pack   and   travel   with .
wonderful   bear   excellent   addition   to   any   baby   s   nursery .   the   sounds   are   soothing   and   the   bear   is   really   cute   too .
baby   feeding   it   s   a   very   practical   item ,   it   saves   time   and   avoids   forgetting   milk   food   being   overcooked   boiled !   br   is   very   easy   to   clean .   br   is   not   heavy   at   all ,   you   can   carry   it   everywhere .
great   carrier   the   carrier   is   very   travel   friendly .   i   sing   goin   bye   byes   from   baby   clean   fun   ...   to   my   8   month   old   as   i   load   her   in   the   carrier   to   take   a   walk .   it   fits   in   my   diaper   bag   very   easily .   there   are   tons   of   ways   to   position   your   baby   too .
womb   bear   i   bought   this   for   my   5   week   old   twin   boys   hoping   it   would   help   them   sleep   but   it   didn   t   help   either   one .
love   a   duck ! !   i   love   this   duck !   my   daughter   is   only   2   months   old ,   she   does   not   take   a   pacifier   often ,   but   when   she   does   she   has   trouble   keeping   it   in   her   mouth .   this   duck   keeps   the   pacifier   in   near   her   mouth   so   she   can   play   with   it   or   suck   if   she   wants .   it   has   been   great   for   when   she   is   cranky   in   the   car .   br   br   a   friend   of   mine   recommended   the   wubbanubs   to   me .   she   said   her   daughter   used   to   grab   on   to   it   and   chew   the   pacifier .   whatever   keeps   them   occupied   is   ok   with   me .   br   br   the   only   reason   i   gave   it   4   stars   is   that   i   think   it   could   be   a   little   cheaper .   all   it   is   is   a   tiny   stuffed   animal   smaller   than   a   beanie   baby   sewn   onto   a   soothie   pacifier .   makes   me   wish   i   had   thought   of   it   first ...
pretty   good !   this   is   actually   pretty   good !   i   use   it   for   warming   breastmilk   formula .   it   took   a   few   tries   to   get   it   perfect   temperature ,   but   i   have   never   had   too   hot   milk ,   so   my   baby   didn   t   get   hurt .   there   were   a   few   times   where   the   milk   wasn   t   too   warm   but   didn   t   take   long .   my   measuring   cup   s   markings   did   rub   off   after   2   months ,   and   i   contacted   munchkin   and   they   sent   me   a   new   one   for   free .
don   t   wast   your   money !   did   not   like   this   item   at   all .   the   wings   on   the   pacifer   would   not   stay   open   so   that   the   baby   could   use   it .   this   item   went   in   the   trash !
does   not   last   long   we   bought   this   about   6   weeks   ago ,   and   it   has   already   stopped   beeping   when   the   nipple   is   sterlised   or   milk   is   warm .   now   the   markings   on   its   measuring   cup   is   coming   off .   br   br   basically ,   i   believe   minchkin   has   cut   corners   with   poor   quality   product .   not   recommended   at   all ... i   would   prefer   some   other   brand .
only   pacifier   my   baby   will   take .   like   the   reviewer   below ,   my   baby   also   was   sucking   on   her   hands ,   her   clothes ... and   did   not   like   the   avent   pacifiers   i   had   bought   for   her .   my   friend   told   me   to   try   a   soothie ,   and   it   worked   wonders ,   immediately .   baby   does   not   spit   it   out .   it   apparently   is   suitable   for   babies   who   breastfeed .   i   would   have   to   agree   that   the   con   is   the   lack   of   a   handle .   there   are   2   little   holes   in   the   pacifier   that   you   could   use   to   tie   a   makeshift   pacifier   clip   string ,   otherwise   you   should   get   several   in   case   it   falls   out   and   gets   lost .   side   note   it   is   very   cute   to   watch   your   baby   sucking   on   this ... you   can   see   his   her   mouth   working   through   the   pacifier
workhorse   purchased   for   the   upstairs   nursery ,   it   has   saved   me   from   stumbling   downstairs   to   the   kitchen   for   late   night   early   morning   feedings .   fits   the   avent   as   well   as   the   thinner   bottles .   i   recommend   using   the   caps   that   come   with   your   bottles   when   you   warm   up   junior   s   food   repels   the   condensation   .   br   br   i   d   give   it   five   stars ,   but   the   beeps   are   a   feature   that   i   wish   could   be   turned   off   by   the   user   note   to   munchkin .   br   br   worth   every   penny .
only   pacifier   my   twins   will   take !   my   twin   daughter   really   needed   a   pacifier   as   she   was   chewing   her   clothing   and   this   was   the   only   one   she   would   take   and   she   loves   it !   br   br   the   only   con   is   that   it   has   no   handle .
funny   but   broken   this   was   the   funniest   thing   at   halloween , but   it   was   also   broken . it   lasted   one   day   before   it   dropped   out   of   his   mouth   and   a   whole   20   inches   to   the   ground   and   snapped   a   piece   off . i   would   not   buy   again .
nice   product   my   wife   bought   this   one   when   my   daughter   was   2   months   old .   we   feed   our   daughter   with   bottles   mix   formula   with   breast   milk   ,   and   since   each   time   we   need   to   take   the   bottled   breast   milk   from   ref   my   wife   did   breast   bumping   ,   and   mix   with   formula ,   we   use   this   warmer   all   the   time .   also ,   when   we   travel   out ,   this   one   is   quite   useful .   generally   with   only   a   little   small   amount   of   water ,   the   bottle   is   warm   enough   to   feed   my   baby .   also   it   is   quite   compact   to   put   in   the   diaper   bag   well ,   not   compact   bag   though   .
clear   is   cool   i   like   that   these   are   clear .   unfortunately   my   daughter   stopped   using   a   pacifier ,   but   when   she   did   use   it ,   i   liked   being   able   to   still   see   her   beautiful   face .
we   loved   the   mommy   bear   we   recieved   this   as   a   gift   off   of   our   registry   at   target   and   we   love   this   bear .   it   is   very   cute   and   cuddly   and   is   not   imposing   in   the   crib .   the   adjustable   volume   and   automatic   shutoff   is   also   nice .   hands   down   one   of   our   favorite   shower   gifts .
thank   goodness !   my   newborn   son   would   not   take   a   pacifier   for   the   first   three   weeks   of   his   life .   we   tried   many   different   brands   advent ,   mam ,   etc .   but   unlike   his   older   sister   who   took   to   the   advent   brand   on   her   second   day   of   her   life ,   he   did   not   like   it   at   all .   the   shape   of   the   pacifier   seems   more   natural   to   the   breastfeed   baby .   i   would   strongly   recommend   this   pacifier   to   all   mothers   that   are   breastfeeding .   we   are   so   thankful   that   we   found   this   pacifier ,   especially   at   2   in   the   morning ! !
this   thing   is   horrid !   i   m   currently   in   the   process   of   adopting   my   son ,   and   i   bought   this   to   take   to   guatemala   with   me   when   i   visited .   it   never   worked   it   didn   t   matter   how   much   water   i   put   in   the   chamber ,   it   would   never   cycle   on   more   more   than   30   seconds .   i   then   had   to   wait   approximately   5   minutes   for   it   to   cool   back   down   before   using   it   for   another   30   second   cycle .   i   ended   up   filling   the   ice   bucket   with   hot   water ,   and   letting   the   bottle   sit   in   that   to   warm   up .   br   br   needless   to   say ,   it   s   been   sent   back .   i   think   i   ll   just   use   the   microwave   when   the   baby   gets   home   it   s   got   to   be   easier   and   quicker   than   this   thing .

wonderful   pacifier   i   have   been   very   impressed   with   every   avent   product   that   i   have   purchased .   i   have   found   these   pacifiers   to   be   so   nice .   they   are   completely   clear   and   you   are   able   to   see   smiles   around   them .   my   baby   loves   hers .   we   can   t   live   without   them .
soothing   and   effective   the   womb   sounds   bear   has   put   my   little   boy   to   sleep   numerous   times .   i   really   think   the   rhythmic   sound   it   emits   helps   him   relax   and   think   he   is   in   the   womb   again .   most   of   the   time   i   put   him   down   when   he   is   sleepy   to   begin   with ,   but   the   womb   sounds   bear   has   helped   him   to   go   back   to   sleep   if   he   is   waking   up ,   having   a   hard   time   drifting   off ,   or   being   generally   grumpy .   the   sound   is   fairly   soothing ,   you   can   adjust   the   volume ,   and   it   even   has   an   automatic   timer   that   makes   it   shut   off   after   40   minutes !   myself   and   my   husband   have   both   laughed ,   saying   that   it   has   helped   us   to   go   to   sleep   when   it   is   on .   great   buy   for   new   moms   or   for   a   gift .

great   product   worth   the   extra   i   also   didn   t   think   a   video   monitor   would   be   necessary ,   but   my   husband   a   gadget   guy   wanted   one ,   so   we   1st   got   the   sight   sound   assurance   by   safety   1st .   the   monitor   on   the   safety   1st   was   always   b   w   and   pretty   grainy ,   also   the   monitor   is   very   bulky   and   always   has   to   be   plugged   in .   br   br   as   soon   as   we   plugged   in   this   summer   infant   monitor   we   were   both   amazed   at   the   picture   quality .   it   is   very   clear   even   at   night   and   you   can   adjust   the   brightness   of   the   picture   to   your   liking .   it   picks   up   sound   extremely   well   too .   also   for   those   of   you   with   a   wireless   network   we   have   had   no   problems .   love   that   you   can   see   the   video   with   volume   all   the   way   down   and   that   the   video   turns   off   after   a   few   seconds   button   on   top   turns   it   back   on   instantly   br   br   only   negative   a   little   bit   of   background   static   my   husband   didn   t   notice   it .   br   br   btw   someone   was   complaining   about   the   picture   being   b   w   at   night   every   monitor   system   would   be   b   w   at   night ,   because   there   is   no   such   thing   as   color   in   the   absence   of   light !  
not   new   and   improved ! ! !   i   just   purchased   my   second   diaper   champ ,   as   i   have   two   children   in   diapers   and   another   on   the   way .   i   finally   gave   up   on   the   diaper   genie ,   i   just   couldn   t   get   the   smell   out   of   the   plastic .   so   i   go   to   the   store   to   buy   another   diaper   genie   for   the   second   nursery   and   find   that   it   is   a   new   design .   i   read   the   description   and   think   it   must   be   better   than   the   old   design   and   since   i   like   the   old   one   i   will   love   this   one .   br   boy   was   i   wrong .   first   off   you   have   to   put   this   together   yourself   by   simply   snapping   on   the   lid .   this   was   not   difficult ,   but   i   immediately   notice   that   it   does   not   flip   as   smoothly   as   the   original   and   the   seal   doesn   t   seem   as   tight   fitting .   br   br   i   do   like   that   it   is   wider   at   the   top ,   but   it   is   also   shorter   and   you   need   to   bend   more ,   something   us   parents   do   too   much   of   during   the   day   as   it   is . but   i   am   still   willing   to   give   it   a   try .   br   after   three   days   use   i   notice   the   room   has   that   oh   so   familiar   smell   of   dirty   diapers .   i   thought   at   first   it   was   the   trash   can   that   still   had   a   few   diapers   in   it   from   our   transition   phase   of   not   having   a   diaper   pail   for   a   day ,   but   after   removing   the   can   i   still   notice   the   smell . the   new   design   does   not   prevent   the   smell   from   escaping   and   it   will   be   going   back ,   i   just   hope   i   can   find   one   of   the   old   designs   left   on   the   shelf .
this   toy   box   is   worthless   i   bought   two   other   toy   boxes   that   are   holding   up   just   fine ,   but   this   toy   box   fell   apart   after   a   short   time .   i   purchased   it   the   day   before   christmas   online .   it   was   put   together   right   after   christmas ,   but   not   used   right   away .   once   it   was   used ,   it   was   obvious   it   was   defective   and   dangerous   to   children   .   it   is   now   past   the   return   policy   deadline .   since   it   fell   apart ,   i   didn   t   have   to   take   it   apart   for   the   trash   area ,   but   did   have   to   remove   many   sharp   pieces   of   hardware   from   it   to   protect   any   children   that   might   be   near   the   trash   area .   a   wasted   51.17   that   s   for   sure .
beautiful   and   practical   we   just   purchased   this   set   for   our   new   baby   and   it   is   adorable .   i   ve   been   looking   for   a   cute   pooh   bedding   set   for   a   while   and   found   this   one   at   the   last   minute .   the   bedding   soft   and   you   can   not   beat   the   price .   we   also   purchased   the   matching   cribskirt   and   pillow   and   are   very   happy   with   the   quality   of   the   bedding .
i   love   this   folding   potty ! ! !   i   love   the   primo   folding   potty !   it   is   the   best !   it   is   so   compact   and   easy   to   carry   with   me   when   i   take   my   son   to   the   stores   or   restaurants .   i   haven   t   had   any   problems   finding   toilets   that   it   doesn   t   work   on .   my   son   finds   it   very   secure ,   especially   when   he   can   hold   on   to   the   handles .   i   love   the   fact   that   he   has   handles   to   hold   onto   instead   of   the   dirty   toilet   bowl .   it   is   very   sturdy   and   easy   to   clean .
best   thing   we   ever   purchased   for   our   baby !   this   monitor   is   definitly   the   best   purchase   we   made !   being   a   first   time   parents   we   were   constantly   worried   about   everything !   especially   when   our   baby   was   asleep .   yeah ,   we   tried   sleeping   in   the   same   room   for   a   while ,   but   around   3   months   she   started   waking   up   every   time   we   moved .   so   we   purchased   the   monitor   and   set   it   up   right   on   the   side   of   the   crib ,   so   that   we   could   see   her   face .   you   can   hear   every   breath   she   takes   and   the   video   quality   is   great   when   the   lights   are   off ,   you   can   see   as   good   as   if   it   was   daytime .   we   live   in   an   appartment   building ,   but   there   is   hardly   ever   any   interference .   the   baby   is   now   1   and   half   and   we   moved   the   camera   in   the   corner   of   the   room ,   so   that   you   could   see   the   whole   crib .   i   can   see   her   playing   and   it   is   so   much   fun   watching   her   talk   to   her   toys   and   laugh   all   by   herself .   i   would   recommend   this   product   for   every   parent   out   there .
a   must   this   sterilizer   is   an   absolute   must .   a   quick   hand   wash ,   and   i   don   t   have   to   worry   about   the   rest .   it   can   fit   the   parts   to   my   isis   iq   duo ,   bottles ,   pacifiers ,   etc .   it   doesn   t   take   much   counter   space ,   and   keeps   my   kitchen   neat .
used   correctly ,   this   seat   is   perfect !   i   ve   been   reading   the   reviews   about   people   putting   their   babies   in   this   in   the   rocking   position ,   and   that   s   entirely   too   early   for   this   feature   to   be   used .   the   rocker   part   is   for   when   the   child   is   old   enough   to   reach   the   floor   with   his   her   own   legs .   you   wouldn   t   put   a   child   in   an   adult   rocking   chair   and   you   shouldn   t   use   the   rocking   feature   of   this   chair   for   babies   either .   it   s   for   the   toddler   stage .   i   ve   had   this   rocker   for   6   years   and   none   of   my   3   children   have   ever   fallen   out   because   they   ve   never   been   put   in   by   themselves   in   the   rocker   mode .
bid   deception   this   product   promises   great   sound   and   picture .   it   does   not   deliver .   static   is   everywhere .   even   tried   to   shut   down   all   other   wireless   devices   in   the   house .   does   not   work .   would   not   recommend   this   product   at   all ....
baby   loves   it !   after   reading   plenty   of   reviews   like   you   are   doing   now   about   entertainers ,   i   chose   this   one   because   of   its   better   than   the   rest   safety   reviews .   our   4   month   old   really   loves   this   and   has   worked   up   to   about   15   or   20   minutes   at   a   time .   br   br   she   can   just   about   stand   flat   footed ,   but   not   quite ,   so   we   put   a   bath   mat   under   her   feet ,   which   works   great   because   the   rubber   back   doesn   t   slip   around   when   she   tries   to   twist   herself ,   and   the   rug   gives   her   more   traction   than   just   her   socks   on   the   plastic   bottom .   also ,   we   put   her   in   the   seat   backwards   as   she   doesn   t   have   100   control   over   herself   yet ,   and   it   really   helps   she   is   able   to   lean   against   the   high   part   of   the   seat ,   yet   her   arms   are   still   over   the   top   to   play   with   the   toys .   br   br   not   many   cons   to   this   product .   if   i   had   to   nitpick ,   i   might   take   off   the   hand   puppet   it   seems   to   be   too   close   and   just   gets   in   her   way ,   and   she   has   no   interest   in   playing   with   it .   this   is   a   great   product !
bad   experience   this   travel   system   is   a   good   idea .   however   a   wheel   broke   off   on   our   2nd   flight ,   probably   due   to   baggage   handlers ,   so   would   not   buy   this   product   again .
kills   wifi ,   design   is   flawed   as   you   cannot   mount   on   a   wall   over   a   crib   at   first   glance   the   mobicam   looks   great   and   the   initial   reviews   i   read   seemed   good .   i   should   have   checked   further .   the   first   problem   with   this   is   the   design .   there   is   a   wall   mount   attachment   that   comes   with   it   but   the   camera   does   not   tilt   all   the   way   down   so   if   you   mount   the   mobicam   on   a   wall   above   a   crib   it   shoots   the   opposing   wall   rather   then   pointing   directly   down   to   the   crib .   then   i   thought   i   can   somehow   mount   it   to   the   ceiling ,   but   then   it   occured   to   me   that   i   cannot   get   the   power   cord   up   there .   also ,   the   power   cord   is   only   3   feet   long ,   way   to   short   to   mount   it   high   enough .   i   had   to   go   out   and   buy   shelves   and   install   them   and   then   strap   the   thing   to   the   shelf   to   get   it   to   point   down .   br   br   then   we   turned   it   on   and   it   killed   our   wifi   network .   br   br   i   am   over   this   thing .   i   am   going   to   see   if   there   is   a   better   one   out   there .
not   enough   border   to   complete   a   small   room ! ! ! !   i   can   t   believe   that   the   manufacturer   would   try   and   rip   you   off   this   way .   i   am   very   shocked .   our   room   is   9feet8inches   by   10feet6inches   and   i   was   only   able   to   do   three   walls ! ! !   this   doesn   t   include   the   last   10ft6in .   wall !   what   size   room   did   they   have   in   mind   a   closet !   br   br   you   have   to   buy   2   wall   borders   to   do   such   a   small   room .   i   am   so   angry   that   i   want   to   take   it   down   and   not   even   have   the   border   instead   of   go   out   and   spend   another   19   to   finish   one   wall !   br   br  
2000km   and   counting ...   i   m   an   avid   runner   so   when   we   knew   we   were   having   a   family   my   task   was   to   find   a   jogging   stroller .   after   reviewing   all   type   for   months   on   the   internet   i   finally   went   with   the   reebok .   i   was   able   to   start   running   with   my   daughter   when   she   was   three   months   old   because   the   reebok   was   one   of   the   only   strollers   that   could   recline .   it   has   a   front   zip   on   pocket   that   catches   any   toys   that   are   dropped   instead   of   them   falling   on   to   the   road   and   it   also   acts   as   protection   against   the   sun   in   the   summer   and   the   cold   of   the   winter .   it   s   nice   and   compact   in   the   seating   area   so   when   out   running   in   the   winter   with   the   plastic   cover   on   included   with   the   stroller   ,   heat   loss   is   minimal .   br   yes   it   did   pull   to   one   side   but   it   doesn   t   take   a   rocket   scientist   to   realize   how   to   correct   the   problem   with   out   reading   the   instructions .   i   m   not   a   big   muscular   person   and   i   find   it   easy   to   run   while   controlling   the   stroller   with   one   hand .   br   i   ve   now   had   the   reebok   for   just   over   a   year ,   i   run   3   4   times   a   week   with   my   daughter   and   i   m   about   to   pass   the   2000km   mark   using   it   for   running   only ,   not   including   any   walks   we   do   with   it .   i   ve   never   had   a   deflated   tire   or   a   bent   frame ... i   don   t   know   what   one   does   to   bend   the   frame ! !   br   would   and   have   recommended   the   reebok ,   great   jogging   stroller .   br

no   complaints   here ...   the   munchkin   healthflow   deluxe   bottle   and   food   warmer   is   easy   and   convenient .   using   the   water   measure   is   not   an   exact   science   and   has   been   more   of   a   trial   and   error   process .   i   say   error   meaning   that   slightly   too   little   water   lower   measurement   mark   just   means   the   2   3   oz   of   chilled   formula   warmed   in   a   ventaire   6   oz   bottle   is   only   luke   warm ... which   doesn   t   seem   to   phase   my   infant   when   she   is   ready   for   a   meal .   also ,   if   the   water   measurement   is   filled   over   the   upper   mark ,   the   bottle   is   still   comfortably   warm   for   feeding .   my   husband   and   i   have   not   had   a   bottle   that   was   too   cold   or   too   hot   which   is   one   less   thing   to   worry   and   fuss   about   when   we   are   half   asleep   fumbling   in   the   kitchen   in   the   middle   of   the   night   to   feed   our   newborn .   br   br   because   of   the   type   of   bottles   we   use ,   we   occasionally   have   formula   leak   out   from   the   bottom   seal   during   the   warming   process .   this   is   easy   to   clean   even   if   it   gets   baked   a   bit   from   the   warming   plate   by   using   the   bottle   scrubber ,   dish   soap ,   and   a   paper   towel   to   wipe   it   up .   the   leak   can   be   avoided ,   by   the   way ,   if   you   take   the   cap   off   before   heating   so   that   the   pressure   escapes   through   the   top   nipple   rather   than   the   bottom   seal   of   the   ventaire   bottle .   br   br   i   do   not   know   how   the   warmer   will   perform   when   the   baby   starts   to   drink   more   each   feeding .   if   we   continue   to   use   ready   to   feed   formula   which   needs   to   be   chilled   i   imagine   we   might   have   to   warm   larger   bottles   twice   before   they   are   ready .   more   likely ,   we   will   switch   to   powdered   formula   and   flouridated   water   at   room   temperature   which   will   only   need   one   time   through   the   warmer .   br   br   in   summary   four   stars   for   a   good   product   only   because   i   anticipate   having   to   be   flexible   with   it   s   use .
worth   every   penny   !   we   love   this   bottle   warmer .   i   was   a   little   skeptical   about   getting   a   bottle   warmer   after   reading   some   of   the   reviews   of   the   other   brand   names   of   warmers .   but   i   decided   to   go   with   this   one   since   its   reviews   were   good   and   i   am   so   glad   i   did .   i   love   the   automatic   shut   off   function   and   the   beep   when   it   is   finished .   like   anything   else ,   you   have   to   use   good   sense   and   adjust   the   amount   of   water   according   to   how   much   in   the   bottle   and   check   the   temp   before   giving   it   to   baby   but   i   have   easily   learned   to   estimate   the   amount   of   water   needed   based   on   the   amount   in   the   bottle .   this   is   definitely   something   you   will   want   if   you   are   heating   bottles   ! ! !
best   bottle   warmer !   i   read   many   reviews   before   purchasing   this   bottle   warmer .   many   others   are   reported   to   heat   unevenly ,   too   hot ,   or   too   cold .   we   ve   had   no   problems   with   this   one !   of   course   i   do   swirl   the   milk   around   after   it   s   heated   just   in   case ,   but   i   works   wonderfully !   if   you   need   a   bottle   warmer ,   get   this   one !
i   love   it ! ! ! ! !   i   previously   had   the   baby   s   quiet   sounds   summer   infant   care   monitor   but   returned   it   b   c   the   reception   started   out   ok   and   then   got   progressively   worse .   as   soon   as   i   plugged   in   this   monitor   the   picture   quality   was   crystal   clear   and   the   sound   monitor   is   very   sensitive .   if   you   are   going   to   be   far   away   from   the   signal   then   you   ll   have   to   plug   it   into   the   wall   to   boost   the   signal ,   but   it   still   works   very   well .   br   br   i   m   very   pleased   and   would   recommend   buying   one   the   sooner   the   better ! !   br  
would   think   twice   about   recommending   this   because .... my   little   guy   could   not   sit   without   being   squished .   the   seat   does   not   recline   back   at   all   which   means   you   can   t   put   a   baby   in   it   until   they   can   hold   their   head   up   well .   even   after   that ,   if   they   fall   asleep   you   are   back   to   the   slumping   head .   the   only   reason   i   bought   this   product   was   because   it   was   such   a   good   deal   on   sale   but ,   i   would   never   pay   full   price   and   am   even   debating   returning   it !   its   really   a   shame   because   most   fisher   price   products   are   so   good   but ,   stay   away   fromo   this   one !   trust   me .
great   idea ,   but   i   was   excited   to   see   so   many   positive   reviews   for   this   product .   my   daughter   is   getting   too   broad   for   the   baby   bjorn   she   s   9   months   and   21   pounds   and   she   really   likes   to   be   upright   when   carried .   this   carrier   is   very   comfortable   for   about   10   minutes ,   then   she   starts   to   slide   down   to   the   point   where   her   head   is   resting   near   the   low   end   of   my   sternum   and   her   feet   hit   my   legs   when   i   walk .   she   s   very   snug   when   i   first   put   her   in .   it   s   hard   to   put   on   outside   the   house   it   is   so   long ,   it   drags   on   the   ground   when   wrapping   around   your   waist   not   great   in   filthy   parking   lots .   also ,   it   is   hard   to   get   her   out   easily   when   i   want   to   lay   her   down   after   she   falls   asleep .   i   have   to   wrestle   her   out   which   of   course   wakes   her   up .   when   i   put   her   forward   facing ,   the   strap   cuts   into   her   neck   no   matter   where   i   put   her   arms .   the   side   position   was   awkward .   there   is   so   much   fiddling   and   adjusting   she   gets   more   fussy .   so   i   will   return   it   and   look   for   another   solution .
not   what   i   expected   when   i   first   saw   this   bouncer   i   fell   in   love   wth   it !   i   loved   the   print   and   the   fish   that   kiss !   my   son   really   liked   the   vibration .   however ,   it   would   go   through   batteries   like   crazy .   i   felt   like   we   were   changing   the   batteries   every   week .   my   son   is   4   months   old   and   he   has   never   paid   attention   to   the   fish   that   kiss .   also ,   after   a   few   days   of   using   it   the   bubbles   that   make   the   starfish   spin   stopped   coming   out   so   he   didn   t   work .   i   have   since   taken   the   fish   attatchment   off   and   i   use   it   strictly   for   the   chair   aspect   of   it .   save   your   money   and   buy   something   else .   i   was   very   dispointed   with   this   bouncer .
great   product   our   2   1   2   month   old   son   cannot   stay   asleep   longer   than   15   minutes   on   his   back   without   this   swaddle   me .   we   haven   t   had   problems   with   the   velcro   wearing   out   like   some   of   the   other   reviewers   the   tag   says   to   close   the   velcro   while   washing   .   he   s   pretty   much   grown   out   of   this   size   though   he   s   somewhere   between   12.5   and   13   lbs   ,   and   we   just   ordered   the   large   size   online   from   stewart   toys .   on   a   side   note ,   we   also   ordered   the   miracle   blanket   and   simple   swaddle   online ,   thinking   we   would   use   whichever   product   worked   best .   we   sent   both   of   those   blankets   back .   swaddle   me   is   a   great   product   and   i   highly   recommend   it   to   anyone   whose   baby   needs   to   be   swaddled   to   sleep   it   s   incredibly   simple   to   use   and   makes   our   son   a   happy   sleeper !   it   s   also   much   less   expensive   than   those   other   blankets .  
great   design ,   loved   by   my   daughter   my   14   month   old   daughter   loves   this   cup .   she   can   stick   her   fingers   thru   the   opening   in   the   cup   and   hold   it   easily ,   even   with   one   hand .   she   also   plays   with   it   like   a   toy   in   car   trips ,   and   forgets   screaming   for   a   while .   i   also   like   it   having   a   big   diameter   so   that   my   creative   daughter   can   t   turn   open   it .   at   the   beginning   it   seemed   to   leak   from   the   cup   rim .   turned   out   there   were   liquids   residue   from   filling   the   cup .   got   that   wiped   down   then   close   the   lid   tightly ,   it   didn   t   leak   again .   the   only   drawback   is   lack   of   replacement   valves .   otherwise ,   the   ansa   cup   would   have   been   a   5   star   for   us .

extremely   pleased   my   husband   and   i   fell   in   love   with   this   bedding   as   soon   as   we   saw   it .   we   spent   weeks   trying   to   find   a   bedding   for   our   upcoming   son   and   this ,   to   us ,   is   perfect .   it   passed   the   first   wash   dryer   test   with   pretty   much   no   problems ,   all   the   seams   and   stuffing   stayed   in   tact .   one   word   for   the   wise   is   that   the   material   on   the   sheet ,   dust   ruffle ,   diaper   hanger ,   and   valance   wrinkled   in   the   wash   badly ,   because   of   the   type   of   material   so   expect   to   spend   some   time   ironing   when   done   afterword   i   thought   it   may   have   been   better   to   only   wash   those   things   the   baby   will   come   in   contact   with   like   the   sheet   and   bumper   pads   and   left   the   rest   alone   .   i   consider   that   a   first   time   mom   s   live   and   learn   experience .   also   be   careful   of   shrinking   which   i   did   notice   slightly   with   the   dust   ruffle   only .   br   br   overall   we   are   extremely   happy   with   the   product ,   its   absolutely   adorable   it   looks   much   better   in   person   than   in   the   pictures ... which   i   thought   were   great !   for   the   quality   and   cost   for   this   6   piece   set ,   i   really   dont   think   you   can   beat   it .
perfect   addition   to   john   lennon   set   i   have   this   memory   book   for   my   dd   who   is   now   2 ,   and   am   registering   for   it   for   baby   2 .   the   pages   are   easy   to   fill   out   and   gets   all   the   pertinent   info .   i   have   had   no   problems   with   it   falling   apart .   fits   perfectly   into   john   lennon   keepsake   box   with   baby   hat ,   hospital   bands ,   etc .
pleased   i   had   to   get   a   pump   in   order   to   return   to   work   and   still   breastfeed   my   baby .   a   family   member   and   i   went   to   babies   r   us   to   purchase   the   pump .   after   going   back   and   forth   over   what   the   difference   was   in   price   on   medela   s ,   he   found   playtex   on   the   shelf .   after   we   noticed   the   price   difference   i   decided   to   go   with   playtex   since   it   seemed   to   offer   the   same   quality   as   medela .   i   was   a   little   skeptical   at   first   but   once   i   got   home   and   got   into   a   routine   i   became   pleased   with   the   purchase .   i   would   recommend   this   to   anyone   who   s   a   working   mother   and   breastfeeding .
best   car   seat   ever   i   did   the   research   thru   word   of   mouth   and   consumer   reports ,   i   must   admit   i   did   fall   for   the   negative   review   from   consumers   and   purchased   another   car   seat .   i   purchased   the   cosco   alpha   omega   convertible .   let   me   tell   you   after   three   hours   of   trying   to   install   it   into   my   suv ,   i   gave   up   and   returned   it .   the   seat   would   slide   from   side   and   side   after   it   was   properly   installed .   i   purchased   the   marathon   and   after   three   minutes   the   car   seat   was   installed .   the   seat   would   not   budge .   the   latch   system   is   easy   to   us   and   since   it   has   individual   tension   releases   on   each   side   it   makes   it   very   easy   to   operate .   the   car   seat   is   costly   but   its   worth   it   from   an   installation   and   safety   perspective .   there   are   web   sites   that   offer   the   marathon   at   a   discounted   rate   ...   also   in   nj   buy   buy   baby   is   offering   10   coupons .   buy   this   and   you   will   not   be   disappointed .   br  
lots   of   features ,   well   made ,   quite   large   for   back   seat !   this   car   seat   is   of   excellent   quality .   the   drawbacks   i   can   see   is   that   the   recline   function   does   not   recline   far   enough   to   compensate   for   the   slope   of   the   seat   for   the   car   seat   to   sit   with   the   marker   level   to   the   ground   like   it   should   in   the   rear   facing   position .   this   car   seat   is   rather   large   and   i   have   to   move   the   front   passenger   seat   up   in   our   suv   nissan   murano   quite   considerably   in   order   to   put   the   car   seat   in   facing   rearward .   placing   the   rolled   up   towels   underneath   the   base   makes   the   car   seat   level ,   but   it   also   requires   the   front   seat   be   pushed   forward   even   further .   i   test   fit   it   in   the   forward   facing   position   in   the   back   seat   and   the   car   seat   fits   just   fine   that   way .   i   wouldn   t   suggest   buying   this   for   an   infant   if   you   have   a   smaller   back   seat   unless   you   want   your   front   seat   passengers   spending   the   first   year   of   baby   s   life   with   their   knees   in   the   dashboard .   the   nissan   s   back   seat   is   pretty   large   but   perhaps   it   would   fit   better   in ,   say ,   a   suburban   br   i   don   t   like   the   fact   that   the   owner   s   manual   has   diagrams   that   show   the   level   marks   perpendicular   to   the   ground   with   the   car   seat   reclined   while   sitting   in   the   back   seat   without   towels .   they   could   have   designed   it   better   in   my   opinion   so   i   wouldn   t   have   to   use   the   towels .   br   the   level   marks   are   located   on   the   seatbelt   harnesses   that   are   visible   in   the   picture   of   the   product   if   you   were   wondering   .

love   this   pump !   this   is   my   third   child   and   i   had   an   awful   breast   pump   for   my   first   two .   this   one   i   absolutely   love .   its   easy   to   use ,   easy   to   clean ,   and   can   be   used   double   or   single .   it   is   so   easy   you   will   fall   in   love   too ! !   br  
fabulous !   this   rocker   is   perhaps   the   best   thing   that   i   have   gotten   for   my   baby !   she   loves   it !   the   toys   are   big   and   bright   and   easy   to   grab .   the   seat   itself   apppears   to   be   very   comfortable   she   falls   asleep   when   she   is   finished   playing   .   and   perhaps   the   best   part   of   all   is   that   it   is   easy   to   pick   up   and   take   to   grandma   s   house   or   wherever .
love   this   tub   this   item   has   worked   perfectly   from   the   day   my   daughter   was   born .   i   was   nervous   about   baby   bathtubs ,   especially   for   newborns ,   because   i   know   how   slippery   they   are   when   wet   not   to   mention   soapy !   and   how   scrunched   up   they   are   for   the   first   couple   months .   this   tub   comes   with   a   baby   hammock   my   husband   calls   it ,   so   you   aren   t   trying   to   keep   the   infant   in   place   while   trying   to   get   them   clean .   as   a   new   mom ,   you   learn   to   appreciate   stuff   that   really   works .
not   bad   for   a   little   while   i   loved   this   swing   when   we   first   got   it   when   my   son   was   born .   he   loved   it   too ,   the   way   it   would   go   from   cradle   to   regular   swing   was   neet , and   he   loved   to   stare   at   the   sea   creature   mobile   and   the   sounds   where   nice   too .   it   seemed   to   swing   too   fast   on   high ,   but   it   is   ajustable .   i   did   notice   as   the   weeks   went   by   the   swing   wasn   t   working   so   great   as   in   the   beginning .   the   motor   got   very   loud   and   the   music   would   start   to   sound   funny .   the   mobile   was   loud   too .   it   wasn   t   so   easy   to   recline   eather . i   definantly   went   threw   a   lot   of   d   batteries   too .   now   i   am   due   for   my   second   baby   and   the   swing   dosn   t   work   at   all !   the   motor   makes   a   terrible   noise   and   the   swing   dosn   t   swing .   i   don   t   recomend   this   swing   if   you   plan   on   using   it   for   long ,   and   especially   for   a   second   time   around !
had   no   problems ...   my   husband   and   i   got   this   mobile   to   match   the   hampton   bedding   set   and   i   have   not   experienced   any   of   the   problems   mentioned   by   other   reviewers .   br   br   one   thing   to   make   note   of   however   is   that   the   assembly   directions   that   come   with   the   mobile   are   not   for   the   exact   model   that   this   one   is ,   so   the   instructions   are   not   100   accurate .   there   is   actually   less   assembly   required   for   this   one   since   the   hanging   pieces   are   already   attached   to   the   fabric   canopy ,   so   all   you   do   is   fit   the   plastic   hanger   pieces   together ...   which   you   will   want   to   do   with   caution   as   the   picture   illustration   is   backward   to   how   it   really   has   to   go   together   and   if   you   dont   pay   close   attention   you   could   try   to   force   it   in   wrong   and   break   it   .   if   your   crib   has   wide   top   railings   or   round   top   railings   then   this   mobile   will   not   work   for   you   as   the   arm   has   a   lip   that   helps   secure   it   that   will   not   work   on   wide   sections   of   railing .   br   br   i   still   rate   this   a   5   because   for   us   we   had   no   problems   at   all   and   it   really   is   a   beautiful   mobile .
definitely   a   must   but   not   after   6   months   of   age   i   agree   with   the   review   titled   works   great   until   it   breaks .   i   had   the   same   experience .   my   baby   just   loved   his   bouncer .   he   slept ,   relaxed ,   bounced ,   and   enjoyed   the   vibrations   in   the   chair   until   it   suddenly   collapsed   with   him   in   it .   the   wire   leg   just   broke   under   one   of   the   rubber   supports .   thankfully ,   my   baby   is   fine .   fp   is   refunding   me   but   i   have   to   send   them   the   broken   part .   they   say   the   weight   limit   is   25   pounds   my   baby   is   18   pounds   and   the   chair   broke .   i   do   not   recommend   to   use   it   after   your   baby   is   6   months   old   even   though   it   will   be   hard   for   your   baby   and   or   you   to   part   from   it .
get   the   handheld   color   video   monitor   instead ! !   i   had   this   one   and   then   returned   it   b   c   of   the   poor   reception .   it   worked   ok   at   first   and   then   it   was   impossible   to   get   a   clear   picture   plus   the   knobs   are   really   hard   to   turn   b   c   they   are   in   the   back   of   the   monitor .   br   br   the   handheld   color   video   monitor   also   by   the   same   company   was   really   easy   to   install   and   then   the   picture   is   right   there   on   the   lcd   screen   without   any   adjusting   at   all ! !   it   s   worth   the   extra   89 .
love   it !   update   i   first   reviewed   this   item   back   in   april   2005 ,   when   my   daughter   was   4   months   old .   she   is   now   15   months   old   and   the   monitor   is   still   working   prefectly   well .   we   have   not   had   any   problems   with   the   night   vision   nor   the   sound .   we   keep   the   monitor   turned   on   throughout   the   night   and   while   our   daughter   takes   naps .   the   pictures   is   lighter   or   darker   depending   on   the   sorrounding   light ,   so   make   sure   you   adjust   it   accordingly .   we   have   a   second   child   on   the   way   and   will   deffinately   be   using   the   monitor   with   him   her .   if   it   breaks ,   we   will   most   deffinately   buy   another   one .   once   you   have   it ,   you   become   dependent   on   it ...   feel   free   to   view   my   4   stars   as   a   full   5 !   i   must   say   i   was   a   bit   concerned   with   getting   this   monitor   after   reading   previous   comments ,   but   i   m   glad   i   did   get   it !   the   picture   is   clear   and   the   contrast   options   allows   for   the   brightness   of   the   monitor   to   be   adjusted   at   night .   i   would   ve   given   it   5   stars ,   but   every   now   and   then   i   have   a   problem   with   static .   all   and   all   i   m   glad   i   got   it   and   would   recommend   it   to   anyone !
amazed   i   have   to   say   that   i   am   amazed   at   the   ratings   on   this   product .   i   see   sooo   many   people   having   problems ,   but   for   me ,   this   has   been   one   of   the   best   purchases   i   have   made .   i   have   purchased   4   different   monitors   and   always   got   static   and   humming .   i   wanted   the   video   monitor   to   keep   an   eye   on   my   climber   .   i   have   had   it   for   4   months   now   and   it   works   perfectly .   the   picture   is   clear   even   though   the   inside   of   her   room   is   quite   dark   and   the   sound   is   perfect .   i   say ,   give   the   product   a   chance ,   the   reviews   very   positive   or   very   negative ...   give   it   a   chance ! ! !
a   great   purchase !   i   originally   got   a   graco   bouncer ,   it   was   very   plain   and   boring   and   my   1   1   2   month   old   would   only   last   5   minutes   in   it .   we   decided   to   try   the   ocean   wonders   aquarium   bouncer   because   she   has   the   fisher   price   aquarium   in   her   crib   and   absolutely   loves   it .   needless   to   say ,   she   also   loves   this   bouncer .   she   enjoys   it   so   much   that   she   will   stay   for   1   2   hour   1   hour !   i   would   highly   recommend   this   product .   br   br  
reviewer   is   wrong   about   consumer   reports   i   registered   for   this   car   seat .   i   was   very   concerned   when   i   read   the   review   that   said   consumer   reports   reccomends   not   buying   this   seat .   so   i   looked   it   up .   go   to   consumerreports . com   and   click   on   car   seats   then   booster   seats .   the   eddie   bauer   cosco   high   backed   booster   seat   this   one !   got   an   over   all   rating   of   very   good   to   excellent   and   scored   either   very   good   or   excellent   in   every   category .   consumer   reports   says   this   is   a   great   car   seat ! ! !   i   am   glad   i   did   my   research   .
great   and   easy   to   use   i   have   loved   having   these   containers   to   freeze   breastmillk   in .   they   are   easy   to   use .   i   pump   a   little   bit   at   each   feeding   and   fill   up   containers   all   day   in   the   fridge   and   then   at   night   time ,   i   transfer   the   containers   from   the   fridge   to   the   freezer .   also ,   i   haven   t   found   any   leaking   or   problems   putting   the   lids   on   properly .   just   be   patient   and   learn   how   to   do   it   right   the   first   time ,   and   no   more   problems   to   speak   of   arise .   my   one   complaint   is   that   you   can   get   extra   containers   they   are   all   pre   sterilized   but   you   can   t   buy   just   extra   lids   which   i   would   really   love .   so   thats   my   one   complaint .   otherwise ,   i   am   loving   these   containers !

five   star   pump !   i   purchased   this   pump   after   three   frustrating   months   of   attempting   to   use   a   manual   pump   with   poor   results .   i   finally   decided   to   spend   the   big   bucks   and   buy   this   pump   and   it   has   been   well   worth   the   money .   the   first   itme   i   used   it   i   was   able   to   pump   at   least   4   oz .   in   the   first   3   minutes !   my   milk   production   is   great   now .   the   system   is   easy   to   set   up ,   easy   to   use   use   and   is   pain   free !   i   sterilize   most   of   the   parts   in   my   express   microwave   steam   sterilizer   avent   .   my   only   complaint   is   that   the   white   caps   on   the   top   can   be   a   little   difficult   to   take   off ,   however   the   pump   is   very   easy   to   assemble .   this   system   takes   the   stress   out   of   pumping .   it   is   also   very   quiet   compared   to   other   pumps .   i   love   it   and   recommend   it   highly .
i   love   it !   the   1st   week   i   used   it   rite   after   my   bb   was   born   ,   i   hated   it   for   the   fact   that   those   blue   stick   stand   is   really   awkward   to   use   and   to   fit   in   bottles .   the   1st   time   my   husband   was   helping   to   wash   the   bottles ,   he   figured   a   way   to   take   away   the   trouble   by   removing   those   sticks   and   just   left   the   bottom   shelf .   that   helps   a   great   deal   cos   now   i   can   fit   in   as   many   as   6   avent   9   oz .   bottles   and   all   the   nipples !   our   son   is   now   5   months   old   and   he   takes   only   6   bottles   in   a   day ,   so   it   means   i   just   need   to   wash   bottle   for   1   time   day ! !   wohoo ! !   after   the   microwave   is   done ,   i   will   just   let   it   sit   for   couple   mins ,   then   i   will   just   take   the   bottles   out   and   let   it   dry   on   a   clean   towel ,   excellent ! !   br   br   one   reminder   u   need   to   have   a   medium   sized   microwave   so   that   the   sterilizer   can   get   in   easily ! !
hassle   of   a   tub   seat ,   don   t   buy   my   husband   and   i   had   a   really   tough   time   getting   the   seat   into   the   tub   as   it   doesn   t   sit   flush   on   the   bottom   of   the   tub .   it   s   nearly   impossible   to   get   our   6   month   old   into   the   seat .   when   we   finally   got   her   in ,   you   can   t   wash   her   at   all   with   the   seat   around   her .   what   s   worse   is   removing   the   seat   from   the   tub .   it   completely   fills   with   water   and   needs   to   be   tipped   over   several   times   to   try   and   empty .   br   this   was   a   waste   of   time   and   money .
very   happy   i   love   the   carrier .   my   only   concern   is   there   isn   t   a   whole   lot   of   support   for   little   babies   heads .   it   would   be   nice   if   they   could   have   a   small   cushion   there   but ,   otherwise ,   its   a   great   carrier   and   he   loves   it   too !  
love   the   chair ,   hate   the   color ! ! ! !   this   chair   is   great .   it   is   so   easy   to   clean   and   store .   i   bought   this   for   my   nephew   and   he   loves   to   sit   in   it   and   play   while   we   are   eating .   i   wish   that   they   would   make   this   exact   chair   just   with   more   subtle   colors .   the   chair   was   rated   1   by   consumersearch . com .   i   also   read   other   reviews   and   they   all   said   that   this   was   the   best .   please   fisher   price   make   a   nicer   color .   i   docked   on   star   because   of   the   color .

it   s   ok ,   i   m   sure   there   are   better .   this   monitor   is   staticky .   i   mean   if   it   s   the   only   one   you   have   then   it   s   fine   because   you   can   still   hear   your   child ,   but   the   amount   of   static   is   annoying   and   kind   of   distracting   if   you   are   trying   to   do   work .   i   would   suggest   that   parents   shop   around   before   purchasing   an   item   that   is   cheaper .
do   your   research ! ! ! ! ! !   do   your   research   before   buying   this   seat ! ! !   consumer   reports   specifically   recommends   not   choosing   this   seat .   they   say   that   when   used   as   a   booster ,   the   seat   belt   guides   do   not   allow   the   seat   belt   to   move   freely .   the   cosco   summit   high   back   booster   is   better ,   and   totally   recommended   by   cr .   there   is   also   an   eddie   bauer   version   for   those   wanting   a   nicer   fabric .
the   best   gift !   my   son   got   all   the   goodies   we   asked   for   from   the   vibrating   bouncer ,   swing ,   walker   and   more   but   the   only   item   that   he   absolutely   loves   is   his   jumper .   he   is   all   over   the   place   swinging   and   jumping   laughing   and   having   the   time   of   his   life .   i   would   have   done   without   the   swing   and   bouncer   and   stuck   with   this .   it   s   great !
a   must   have   for   breastfeeding   mothers !   if   i   had   to   return   all   my   gifts   and   keep   one ,   this   is   the   one   i   would   keep .   i   got   it   as   a   baby   shower   gift   and   have   used   it   until   my   little   one   was   ready   to   sleep   on   her   crib   at   3   months   of   age   actually ,   that   s   when   i   was   ready   to   let   her   go   to   her   crib ..   .   the   co   sleeper   was   very   easy   to   put   together   and   very   simple   to   attach   to   our   bed .   it   was   great   when   my   daughter   would   wake   up   for   her   middle   of   the   night   feedings .   i   would   pick   her   up ,   feed   her   and   place   her   back   to   sleep   without   ever   leaving   my   bed .   the   only   thing   i   was   not   too   thrilled   about   was   the   mattress   it   comes   with .   i   found   it   to   be   a   bit   hard   so   i   purchased   a   little   pad   and   cut   it   to   fit .   it   worked   great !   i   highly   recommend   this   item   to   all   mothers ,   especially   if   you   plan   on   breasfeeding !  
just   compare   it   to   an   umbrella   stroller ! !   this   stroller   is   nice   looking   and   fine   for   mall   shopping ,   but   if   you   are   doing   anything   outside   in   the   sun   or   light   rain ,   it   s   terrible .   the   canopy   is   so   small   and   doesn   t   cover   anything   which   is   terrrible   when   you   go   to   the   zoo !   i   have   had   two   of   them   and   both ,   i   had   to   return   because   the   wheels   kept   sticking .   the   first   was   the   04   then   i   had   the   05   thinking   that   they   might   have   fixed   the   problem .   they   didn   t .   other   customers   are   right   in   that   when   the   seat   is   in   recline   position   there   is   almost   no   way   to   access   the   basket .   so   if   your   child   is   sleeping   or   you   have   an   infant   seat   on   top ,   you   can   forget   about   accessing   anything   you   have   stored   in   the   bottom .   it   is   a   decent   stroller ,   is   rated   top   by   consumer   reports ,   and   comfy   for   the   child ,   but   to   me ,   it   s   not   worth   the   price .   br   br   if   you   only   want   it   for   those   mall   shopping   trips   where   you   don   t   buy   a   lot ,   then   it   s   probably   perfect   for   you !
great   crib !   ours   shipped   in   10   days .   it   came   with   all   the   parts ,   and   the   wood   is   perfect   absolutely   no   dents ,   dings ,   or   scratches .   the   directions   are   a   little   difficult   to   get   through   the   illustration   doesn   t   match   this   crib .   once   assembled ,   though ,   the   crib   looks   gorgeous !
best   baby   blanket !   i   received   this   blanket   as   a   gift   from   my   mom   and   have   never   felt   anything   so   soft .   my   daughter ,   age   5   months   has   had   this   since   she   was   born   and   loves   it .   oh   yeah ,   and   the   cat   keeps   fighting   with   me   to   claim   it   as   her   own .   my   only   complaint   is   that   i   can   t   find   an   adult   version   of   the   blanket .
great ! !   i   looked   at   several   different   tubs ,   including   some   more   expensive   ones ,   before   purchasing   this   one .   now   i   am   very   glad   i   did   not   buy   one   of   the   more   pricey   models .   i   love   this   tub .   my   daughter   was   only   5   pounds   when   she   was   born ,   and   i   was   afraid   she   might   be   too   small   for   a   tub ,   but   this   one   worked   really   well .   in   fact ,   mine   did   not   come   with   the   cradle   attachment ,   and   it   still   worked   well .   br   br   i   did   not   have   any   trouble   with   the   plug   not   changing   colors .   mine   always   changes   if   the   water   is   too   hot .   br   br   i   also   love   that   the   tub   can   be   used   anywhere .   i   use   it   on   a   small   vanity   in   the   baby   s   bathroom   and   have   plenty   of   room .   i   would   definitely   recommed   this   product .
life   saver   after   having   a   c   section ,   i   was   concerned   how   i   was   going   to   handle   running   up   and   down   stairs   to   accomodate   our   newborn   daughters   sleeping   changing   needs .   br   br   we   decided   to   set   up   the   colby   pack   and   play   downstairs   and   have   not   moved   it   since   our   daughter   is   3   months   old   .   she   loves   taking   naps   in   this   and   it   is   convenient   when   i   am   doing   things   on   the   first   floor .   the   changing   station   is   wonderful   and   has   made   our   lives   so   much   easier .   we   no   longer   have   to   stop   what   we   re   doing   and   run   up   stairs   for   every   diaper   change .   br   br   must   admit   the   music   sounds   and   vibration   option   are   rather   gimmicky .   we   never   use   these   features .   also ,   we   took   it   upon   ourselves   to   add   our   own   mobile   on   the   side   of   the   unit   this   provides   added   entertainment   for   our   daughter   while   we   are   busy   making   dinner   or   fixing   her   bottle .   br   br   though   she   will   be   nearing   the   weight   limit   soon   for   the   changing   unit   and   bassinet   features ,   we   plan   to   leave   it   in   our   living   room .   it   has   truly   helped   us   out   and   i   would   definitely   put   on   my   top   5   list ! !   br   br

outstanding   product   my   baby   suffers   from   acid   reflux   and   sleeps   so   much   more   comfortably   on   his   belly .   i   did   not   like   leaving   him   sleep   on   his   belly   and   if   he   did ,   i   didn   t   get   any   sleep   because   i   was   constantly   checking   on   him .   this   monitor   works   better   than   i   expected ,   well   worth   the   price .   my   baby   and   i   both   sleep   much   better   at   night .   make   sure   you   follow   the   installation   directions   and   it   works   great .   you   won   t   go   wrong   buying   this   product !

great   sterilizer   we   bought   this   for   our   third   baby   who   was   born   5   weeks   early   and   the   hospital   recommended   sterilizing   for   pre   term   babies .   br   the   sterilizer   was   very   easy   and   fast   to   use .   the   only   down   side   is   it   takes   up   quite   a   bit   of   space   for   storage .
my   favorite   blanket   i   have   had   this   for   two   months .   it   is   sooo   soft   and   has   been   washed   at   least   10   times .   i   was   it   in   cold   on   gentle   and   dry   it   on   low .   the   blanket   basically   looks   like   i   just   received   it .   it   is   great   to   swaddle   and   wonderful   as   a   cover   up   for   the   carseat   in   the   cold .   br   seeing   the   other   reviews   i   was   reluctant   to   register   for   this   blanket .   i   did   anyway ,   and   i   would   purchase   another   if   anything   ever   happened   to   our   wamsutta .

horrible   product   do   not   buy !   this   is   a   terrible   product .   the   suction   cups   do   not   work   at   all ,   so   it   slips   all   over   the   place .   despite   the   cushion   it   is   not   comfortable   at   all ,   and   baby   slides   around   in   it .   most   importantly ,   the   underside   of   the   blue   seat   bar   is   rough   and   can   scrape   and   cut   your   baby .   in   my   opinion   this   product   should   be   recalled .
always   broken ! ! !   i   recieved   this   monitor   as   a   baby   shower   present .   if   i   knew   then   what   i   know   now   i   would   never   had   registered   for   it ! !   about   3   weeks   after   my   baby   shower   i   went   to   open   the   monitor   to   get   ready   for   our   upcoming   baby .   when   i   took   it   out   of   the   box   the   antenna   was   broken   off .   i   went   back   to   babies   r   us   and   they   gladly   swapped   it   out   for   me .   i   brought   it   home   and   opened   the   box   and   much   to   my   displeasure   the   same   piece   was   broken   off   and   not   only   was   it   broken   off   the   piece   wasn   t   even   in   the   box ! ! !   i   now   have   to   go   back   to   the   store   yet   again   to   see   if   i   can   find   one   that   isn   t   broken .   my   thought   is   that   anything   that   costs   100.00   and   breaks   before   you   even   use   it   is   a   piece   of   junk ! ! !
waste   of   money   and   source   of   anxiety   this   product   is   useless   until   later   in   the   pregnancy   when   you   are   less   worried   anyway   .   i   couldn   t   hear   anything   with   this   which   of   course   was   upsetting   ,   although   i   could   hear   perfectly   well   with   a   better   monitor .   they   told   me   i   could   get   a   refund   but   they   claimed   they   never   received   it   back   and   i   got   nothing .   i   highly   discourage   buying   this   and   instead   renting   the   better   more   sensitive   one .
love   it ,   love   it ,   love   it ! ! !   this   is   truly   one   of   the   best   items   i   got   for   our   new   baby .   we   live   in   michigan   where   the   winters   are   cold ,   long   and   often   brutal .   the   bundle   me   makes   baby   so   cozy   and   we   do   not   have   to   struggle   with   snow   suits   or   multiple   layers   for   quick   trips   out .   the   zipper   feature   is   nice   too .   you   can   unzip   and   remove   top   of   bundle   me   when   weather   warms   up   a   bit   that   way   baby   is   still   cozy   without   being   too   hot .   br   br  
no   genie   in   this   bottle   at   first   i   was   thrilled   when   my   mother   in   law   got   this   for   me .   it   looked   so   nifty ! !   when   i   brought   my   little   baby   home ,   my   father   set   up   the   system ,   and   i   happily   started   using   it .   i   lost   patience   very   soon .   the   second   and   third   diapers   seem   to   drop   through   to   the   first   one ,   no   matter   how   much   i   twist   the   bag ,   a   foul   smell   escapes   every   time   i   lift   the   lid ,   and   i   hate   the   hassle   of   trying   to   slip   a   long   heavy   snake   of   dirty   diapers   into   another   trash   bag ,   to   take   down   to   the   trash .   i   seem   to   forever   be   needing   to   empty   it ,   and   though   the   refills   do   last   a   while ,   i   could   do   without   the   expense .   we   are   going   out   this   weekend   to   buy   the   diaper   champ .   my   2   girlfriends   have   it ,   and   say   it   is   fantastic .
wonderful   travel   stroller   we   bought   this   item   when   we   were   tired   of   carrying   our   travel   system   around .   it   is   lightweight ,   folds   like   an   umbrella   stroller   and   is   very   sturdy .   i   love   the   basket   underneath .   my   friends   are   all   wanting   one   once   they   saw   mine !   it   is   a   little   more   than   your   average   umbrella   stroller ,   but   i   think   it   is   well   worth   the   extra   money .   you   get   what   you   pay   for !
easy   to   carry   around .   i   like   the   convenience   of   this   small   diaper   bag .   i   wish   it   were   a   tad   bigger .   it   is   had   to   get   my   ventaire   bottles   in   and   out   of   the   sides .   that   is   even   when   the   bag   is   not   full .   i   do   like   to   use   this   on   quick   trips   to   the   store .   i   did   buy   disposable   changing   pads   for   extra   room   in   this   bag .   it   is   so   limited   in   space   if   you   try   to   place   a   changing   pad   inside .
no   smell   in   my   babies   room   we   like   our   diaper   champ   because   you   don   t   have   to   buy   special   bags   and   it   let   s   you   know   when   it   s   full .   we   don   t   have   any   smell   in   our   babies   room ,   and   she   poops   a   lot .
good   monitor   i   really   like   this   monitor .   i   didn   t   think   that   there   would   be   that   big   of   a   difference   between   monitors ,   but   when   my   second   baby   was   born   my   girls   are   only   18   months   apart   i   needed   a   second   monitor .   i   chose   fisher   price   for   my   second   one   so   that   i   could   tell   which   monitor   went   to   which   girl .   unfortunately ,   the   fisher   price   model   has   much   more   static   and   white   noise   when   turned   on   than   does   this   monitor   the   first   years   .   i   have   decided   to   go   get   another   set   like   this   one   and   just   mark   each   unit   to   tell   the   difference .   br   br   the   only   reason   i   didn   t   give   this   monitor   5   stars   is   because   is   does   sometimes   pick   up   neighbors   phone   calls .
we   have   two   of   these !   my   daughter   liked   this   mirror   so   much ,   we   bought   a   second   one .   i   have   attached   them   to   each   end   of   her   crib .   they   really   keep   her   occupied ,   especially   in   the   morning .   i   hear   her   wake   up   and   start   talking   to   the   baby   in   the   mirror .   it   s   really   soft   and   has   a   lot   of   little   fun   toys   for   her   to   play   with   as   well .   cheap   entertainment .
wish   they   have   this   in   store   in   this   part   of   the   world   none   available .
light   and   easy   to   maneuver !   this   light   and   easily   folded   model   is   ideal   for   quick   outings   and   especially   travel .   wonderful   for   airline   trips   when   you   re   juggling   a   stroller ,   the   baby ,   and   diaper   bag .
claims   to   accomodate   eddie   bauer   does   not   lock   in   we   used   the   snap   n   go   when   they   first   came   out ... liked   it   then .   now   with   our   third   child   we   rec   d   the   newer   version .   we   have   an   eddie   bauer   carrier .   the   booklet   that   comes   with   it   shows   the   carrier   and   gives   instructions   on   placement .   the   problem   is   that   the   eddie   bauer   carrier   is   only   held   in   place   by   a   strap   it   does   not   lock   into   place ,   like   all   of   the   other   carriers   would .   now ,   it   may   seem   that   why   not   use   just   the   strap   well ,   the   strap   is   the   second   saftey   mechanism   for   the   seat ... and   really   should   not   be   used   as   the   only   one   b   c   when   you   move   the   stroller   the   seat   moves   around .... the   latch   is   for   a   reason ,   and   if   you   cannot   securely   latch   the   carrier   they   should   never   instruct   you   to   be   able   to   use   it   just   to   make   the   .   we   re   returning   it !   sorry   but   our   child   s   safety   should   be   their   concern ... too !
i   love   my   pump   being   a   first   time   working   mom   i   needed   to   get   an   electrical   pump   so   that   i   could   send   milk   to   day   care .   i   had   planned   on   buying   the   medula   because   that   is   what   anyone   i   know   used .   when   i   got   to   babies   r   us   the   sales   lady   talked   me   into   the   playtex .   she   said   they   had   just   had   a   demonstration   at   the   store   about   the   pump   and   if   she   was   to   buy   a   pump   over   again   she   would   go   with   this   one .   she   said   she   has   a   medula ,   but   after   the   demonstration   she   really   liked   this   one .   so ,   on   her   advice   and   the   basis   that   this   would   be   cheaper   for   me   because   i   had   coupons   i   went   for   it !   br   br   i   find   the   pump   to   be   very   comfortable   and   i   use   full   speed   and   suction .   i   do   not   get   sore   like   i   used   to   when   i   used   my   manual   medula   from   the   hospital .   the   storage   is   great   and   it   is   very   easy   to   clean !   br   br   after   about   a   month   of   use   i   did   have   a   problem   where   the   pump   would   randomly   shut   off   and   eventually   stopped   working .   i   called   playtex   and   they   overnighted   me   a   new   pump   nad   sent   me   a   tag   to   return   the   old   one   free   of   charge .   i   went   less   than   24   hours   without   it .   they   were   great   to   deal   with .   br   br   i   would   recommend   this   pump   to   anyone !
terrible !   this   monitor   was   terrible !   even   with   the   volume   turned   all   the   way   up   both   on   the   child   receiver   and   the   parent   receiver ,   i   still   couldn   t   hear   my   son .   sometimes   i   would   hear   him   crying   from   the   other   room   but   couldn   t   hear   him   on   the   monitor !   useless !   i   liked   the   light   show   so   we   bought   the   fisherprice   flutter   bye   crib   attachment ,   which   has   a   light   show ,   and   then   traded   this   monitor   in   for   the   fisher   price   900mhz   monitor   which   has   crystal   clear   reception .
a   great   time   saver   i   just   bought   this   2   days   ago   and   i   absolutely   love   it !   my   son   is   3   months   and   i   have   been   boiling   the   bottles   in   a   pot .   what   a   time   consuming   tedious   task   thzat   was .   now   i   just   love   to   make   bottles   again .   ha   ha   this   is   a   great   product   takes   5   minutes   to   sterilize   about   5   bottles .   love   it !   also   so   reasonably   priced   compared   to   the   steam   electric   steralizers .
what   can   t   be   done   with   the   boppy   this   was   the   best   thing   i   received   for   my   shower .   first   of   all ,   i   used   it   immediately   on   myself   after   coming   home   from   the   hospital .   i   used   it   to   sit   on   to   take   the   pressure   off   of   my   stitched   area .   i   could   sit   on   the   couch ,   in   the   bed   and   at   the   kitchen   table   without   needing   any   medication .. thanks   boppy ! !   as   for   my   son ,   i   use   it   for   him   to   sleep   on   while   i   m   doing   housework .   i   prop   it   on   the   couch   and   lay   him   in   the   middle   on   his   side ,   which   adjusts   to   the   perfect   size   for   him .   he   sleeps   like   a   baby !   next ,   i   use   it   when   i   feed   him .   i   breastfed   and   went   to   bottles   later .   it   was   is   perfect   for   both .   i   use   it   to   lay   him   it   after   he   eats   so   i   can   talk   to   him   and   he   can   explore   the   world .   i   use   it   sometimes   when   he   is   doing   tummy   time .   i   use   it   for   my   nieces   so   they   can   hold   him   without   having   to   wear   their   arms   down   since   they   are   only   5   and   7 .   i   have   several   more ,   but   those   are   the   main   points .   i   would   buy   it   over   and   over   again   if   anything   ever   happened   to   my   boppy .   also ,   i   wash   the   slip   cover   many   times ,   and   it   is   standing   strong .   i   have   only   had   to   wash   the   pillow   a   few   times ,   but   it   still   looks   brand   new .   boppy   gets   my   can   t   live   without   vote ... a   update ... it   also   helped   with   my   son   sitting   up .   i   would   place   it   around   him   so   he   wouldn   t   get   hurt   if   he   would   fall   over .   it   keeps   going   and   going   and   going ...
it   s   slow   and   noisy   i   have   been   breast   feeding   pumping   for   5   1   2   months   and   was   using   a   double ,   electric   pump .   i   bought   the   isis   because   of   the   small   size   for   traveling   and   because   of   the   good   reviews   it   got .   br   br   my   advice   for   someone   looking   to   buy   it   for   travel   don   t   do   it .   it   takes   45   minutes   to   express   from   both   sides   because   it   s   so   slow .   the   silicone   insert   is   extremely   squeaky   and   extremely   annoying .   i   also   felt   like   i   was   going   to   get   carpal   tunnel   in   my   hands   from   the   pumping   action .   br   br   i   also   had   a   very   difficult   time   getting   the   suction   quite   right .   i   wanted   to   cry   when   i   used   it   the   first   couple   of   times .
best   bottles   i   ve   found   with   my   first   child ,   we   started   with   avent ,   which   leaked .   then   we   used   dr .   brown   s ,   but   it   s   just   too   much   of   a   hassle   to   clean   that   tiny   little   tube .   now ,   with   our   second   child ,   we   started   out   with   playtex   ventaire .   they   also   leaked ,   even   when   everything   was   perfectly   dried   and   put   together .   i   just   bought   a   set   of   the   gerber   premiums .   my   only   complaint   is   that   my   daughter   seems   to   dribble   more   with   these   bottles ,   but   she   may   not   be   used   to   them   just   yet .
worth   the   money   i   definitely   feel   that   this   seat   is   worth   the   extra   money   over   the   other   popular   seats .   it   seems   to   have   more   cushioning   and   just   feels   more   substantial .   i   do   agree   with   some   of   the   other   reviewers   that   the   seat   is   warm .   my   son   who   is   3   months   now   sweats   terribly   in   it ,   which   is   a   problem   since   we   live   in   florida .   he   outgrew   the   head   rest   rather   quickly ,   but   he   also   had   great   head   control   and   he   hated   the   head   rest   i   think   he   felt   too   confined .   the   only   other   drawback   about   the   seat   is   its   weight   very   heavy .   a   plus   is   that   it   fits   my   maclaren   global   stroller   very   nicely .   all   in   all ,   a   good ,   safe   seat .
poor   quality   after   the   first   washing ,   two   of   the   five   blankets   fell   apart .   i   registered   and   received   both   the   blue   and   green   receiving   blankets   and   returned   them   both .   i   originally   chose   these   because   the   patterns   were   so   cute   but   the   poor   quality   isn   t   worth   keeping   them .   i   wouldn   t   buy   them .
shoulder   strap   too   narrow   it   hurts   i   liked   this   sling   because   of   the   pockets ,   and   it   looks   cool ,   but   it   hurts   if   you   wear   it   for   more   than   a   few   minutes .   i   also   have   a   new   native   baby   sling   which   is   fabulous ,   and   never   hurts   because   the   part   that   goes   over   your   shoulder   is   wide .   br   br   don   t   buy   it .   don   t   register   for   it .   go   new   native .
junk   i   recieved   the   monitor   has   a   gift .   i   used   it   when   i   was   at   my   parents   house ,   because   the   babys   room   is   on   the   other   side   of   the   house .   i   kept   hearing   other   peoples   conversations   and   i   thought   that   was   normal .   then   i   started   hearing   ticking   sounds ,   then   one   moring   i   woke   up   and   it   wasn   t   working .   luckly   the   baby   was   looking   at   her   mobile   just   laying   there .   then   i   would   hear   strange   sounds   coming   from   both   ends .   this   is   my   first   time   using   thos   product   and   my   baby   is   seven   months   old .   i   am   very   upset   about   this   monitor ........
great   for   bottles ..   i   love   this   rack ... i   wish   it   were   bigger   since   i   wash   what   seems   like   a   hundred   bottles   a   day .   i   don   t   have   a   dishwasher .. ugh ! !   i   have   a   large   towel   on   the   counter   and   i   usually   use   this   rack   for   the   nipples .   and   the   compartment   for   the   pacifiers .
poor   craftsmanship   the   cushion   padding   for   my   ottoman   came   out   of   the   box   looking   awful !   the   stitching   isn   t   straight   and   is   ripping   apart   before   i   ve   even   used   it .   i   m   hoping   i   ll   be   able   to   get   a   free   replacement   from   the   company .   babies   r   us   switched   out   the   cushion   for   me   i   just   had   to   make   an   extra   trip   to   the   store .
light   and   mobile !   light ,   inexpensive   and   easy   to   move   around .   if   space   is   scarce ,   this   is   for   you .   the   plastic   is   easy   to   clean .
very   leary   of   this   now   ....   i   have   been   using   this   since   we   brought   our   baby   home .   for   the   first   few   weeks   it   was   a   useful   item .   we   would   swaddle   her   in   a   kiddopotomous ,   and   put   her   in   here   and   she   would   sleep   very   well .   around   a   month ,   she   started   getting   wrestless   about   being   swaddled   so   we   used   a   baby   blanket .   she   started   outgrowing   this   at   about   5   weeks   we   would   find   her   with   her   head   hanging   off   the   top   of   the   incline .   i   adusted   the   side   supports   so   it   was   a   little   more   snug ,   and   farther   down   so   that   her   head   wouldn   t   slide   off .   within   a   couple   of   days   i   woke   up   to   find   her   under   the   blanket   with   her   head   between   the   two   side   supports .   this   to   me   is   more   dangerous   than   allowing   her   to   sleep   on   her   tummy !   we   were   leary   of   potential   suffocation !   our   baby   is   currently   7   weeks   old ,   i   feel   this   was   a   waste   of   money   considering   it   was   only   useful   for   a   month .   this   product   needed   to   be   made   about   6   inches   longer ,   and   the   side   supports   needed   to   be   made   with   a   mesh   fabric   for   breathability   just   in   case   the   baby   wiggles   her   way   down .   good   idea ,   but   needs   improvement .
life   savor   first   i   want   to   comment   on   the   1st   person   s   review .   this   pillow   is   not   for   a   one   month   old ...   it   s   for   24   months   and   up .   did   not   do   her   research !   br   br   this   pillow   is   awesome .   now   my   son   s   head   doesn   t   slouch   down   to   his   chest   while   napping .   and   very   soft !
excellent !   because   you   don   t   have   to   buy   any   refills ,   thank   goodness ,   and   i   have   a   baby   trend   travel   system   that   is   truely   awesome ,   i   thought   i   d   give   it   a   go .   br   i   couldn   t   be   happier ... no   smells ,   easy   to   use   and   very   economical   for   our   tight   budget ,   this   pail   stands   up   to   it   s   name ... a   true   champ !
better   than   the   bouncers   having   three   children   i   decided   to   go   with   the   walker .   we   never   used   one   before   because   it   was   never   recommend   by   dr   s .   this   center   is   the   best .   it   has   stoppers   so   don   t   fear   your   little   one   can   t   move .   pull   them   out   and   you   can   push   them   from   room   to   room   with   you   with   the   handy   holder   in   the   back .   the   baby   loves   it   and   i   think   it   s   great .   also ,   mom   s   who   have   taller   babies   this   one   lasts   longer   than   the   average   bouncer   seems   it   adjusts   higher   than   the   others .
this   is   a   great   rocker .   we   have   had   a   chair   like   this   for   our   daughter   who   will   be   3   years   old   in   may .   she   hated   it   as   a   baby .   we   had   other   bouncer   seats   for   our   two   sons   that   they   loved .   i   think   the   fact   that   if   the   kick   stand   is   out   the   seat   doesn   t   move   she   got   real   bored   real   fast .   plus   it   lays   so   far   back   that   she   couldn   t   see   all   that   was   going   on   around   her .   but   now   that   she   is   older   and   it   can   be   used   as   a   rocker   she   loves   it .   it   gets   used   every   day   to   either   watch   tv   or   read   books   or   to   just   hang   out   in .   plus   she   loves   having   her   own   chair .
great   mattress !   when   my   son   was   born   we   used   our   pack   n   play   as   our   bassinet .   however ,   he   would   not   sleep   well   in   it .   my   husband   and   i   thought   he   was   just   not   a   good   sleeper .   however ,   at   4   weeks   old   we   moved   him   to   the   crib .   he   has   been   sleeping   through   the   night   ever   since .   he   looks   soooo   comfortable   in   his   crib   at   night .   i   am   so   thankful   that   we   bought   this   mattress .   it   certainly   has   made   my   life   easier !
disappointed   i   ve   been   disappointed   with   this   monitor .   i   didn   t   think   that   there   would   be   that   big   of   a   difference   between   monitors ,   but   when   my   second   baby   was   born   my   girls   are   only   18   months   apart   i   needed   a   second   monitor .   i   chose   fisher   price   for   my   second   one   so   that   i   could   tell   which   monitor   went   to   which   girl .   my   first   monitor   was   the   first   years .   unfortunately ,   the   fisher   price   model   has   much   more   static   and   white   noise   when   turned   on   than   does   the   first   years   monitor .   br   br   i   can   hear   my   daughter   on   it   but   the   amount   of   white   noise   static   is   quite   annoying   even   when   the   volume   is   turned   down   really   low .
even   the   rubber   ducky   loves   it !   i   had   orignally   registered   for   the   4   in   1   bath   station .   then   i   read   the   reviews   of   injurys   cause   by   them .   plus ,   my   own   cousin   said   it   hurt   her   daughter   as   well ....   br   then   i   read   the   reviews   and   switched   to   this   tub .   my   son   and   i   love   it .   the   hammock   makes   it   so   easy   to   wash   my   2   month   old .   his   body   is   supported   so   i   rest   his   head   on   my   arm .   i   don   t   have   to   hold   him   up   until   i   have   to   wash   his   back   area .   he   has   fun   kicking   and   pushing   off   of   the   front   of   the   tub .   br   it   fits   nicely   in   the   kitchen   sink   as   well .   br   love   it !
i   use   almost   everything !   i   love   this   kit .   everything   in   this   kit   is   a   necessity   and   works   well .   my   only   complaint   is   the   nail   clippers .   they   are   a   bit   big   to   use   on   a   newborn ...   br   oh ,   and   i   wish   i   knew   what   hospital   the   lady   went   to   that   received   all   of   these   products ... i   got   diapers   and   a   formula   bag ... i   had   to   sneak   the   t   shirt   and   blanket   for   memories ! !
very   disappointed .   others   seem   to   have   had   a   much   better   experience   with   this   item ,   and   we   can   t   understand   why .   when   assembling   the   table ,   it   quickly   became   clear   that   it   was   poorly   made   and   the   components   were   badly   engineered .   for   example ,   one   of   the   bars   would   not   accept   the   screw   that   the   manufacturer   provided   for   it   the   screw   would   not   bite .   the   dowels   were   not   well   sanded   and   seemed   as   if   they   could   cause   splinters .   we   decided   it   wasn   t   worth   continuing   the   assembly   and   returned   it .   also   note ,   the   shelves   are   made   of   a   very   thin   composite   wood   and   are   flimsy .   this   thing   is   overpriced   and   unsafe .
turning   this   thing   takes   an   act   of   god .   i   bought   this   to   use   for   my   newborn   and   2   year   old .   i   took   it   to   the   mall   yesterday   and   it   was   a   nightmare ,   turns   are   impossible !   i   returned   it   last   night   and   am   giving   the   duoglider   by   graco   a   try .   it   s   got   much   better   ratings .   don   t   waste   your   time   on   this   one   just   because   it   may   look   better   and   has   a   cool   toy .   it   s   not   worth   it !
worked   well   in   car   crash   i   bought   this   product   because   i   was   so   afraid   of   the   seat   belt   not   being   tight   enough   for   the   infant   seat   base .   i   have   used   this   product   since   my   son   was   just   a   few   months   old .   i   loved   it .   i   never   worried   about   the   seat   belt   again .   i   was   in   a   car   accident   with   my   child   when   he   was   almost   3   years   old .   i   was   still   using   this   product   with   his   forward   facing   car   seat .   my   car   was   totalled   i   drove   a   saturn   ... the   only   part   of   the   car   without   damage   was   the   roof   the   drivers   side ... my   son   s   car   seat   was   on   the   rear   passenger   side ,   so   he   recieved   more   of   the   impact   than   i   did   being   the   driver .   i   honestly   believe   that   this   product   saved   him   from   worse   injuries   than   he   recieved .   he   came   out   of   the   wreck   with   only   scratches   on   the   top   of   his   head .   even   though   the   mighty   tite   makes   the   seat   belt   tight   so   that   the   car   seat   itself   won   t   slide   around ,   his   car   seat   still   fell   over   that   is   what   shielded   his   body   face   from   the   glass .   i   don   t   know   how   it   worked   out   that   way ,   but   if   his   car   seat   hadn   t   fallen   to   its   side ,   i   think   that   he   may   have   been   hurt   more .   the   mighty   tite   still   worked   fine   after   the   wreck ,   the   seat   belt   never   broke   like   some   of   the   other   reviews   say .   my   son   is   now   in   a   booster   seat   we   don   t   use   the   mighty   tite   anymore ,   but   i   am   pregnant   with   my   2nd   child ,   i   am   definately   going   to   use   this   product   again   with   this   baby .
watch   baby   s   head   with   those   corners !   i   chose   this   tub   because   it   folds   up .   however ,   since   we   use   it   every   night ,   i   haven   t   folded   it   up   since   week   1 .   i   do   like   the   tub   but   find   it   cumbersome   to   use .   it   does   leak   through   one   of   the   fold   up   hinge   gaps   if   there   s   too   much   water   in   the   tub .   also ,   baby   is   now   nearly   8   weeks   old ,   and   already ,   her   feet   spill   over   the   end   of   the   seat   area .   she   s   very   nearly   too   big   for   it   and   measured   22   at   her   6   wk   checkup .   i   can   t   see   her   fitting   in   the   tub   much   longer .   her   feet   do   get   stuck   in   the   gaps   between   the   seat   and   the   side   of   the   tub .   more   importantly ,   for   some   reason ,   there   are   hard   plastic   corners   along   either   side   of   the   pad   where   her   head   is .   she   s   knocked   her   head   on   them   several   times ,   and   any   other   time ,   we   spend   the   whole   bath   on   guard ,   hoping   she   doesn   t   knock   it .   i   m   also   bothered   when   draining   the   tub .   the   plug   has   a   little   rim   around   it   that   sits   up .   i   m   sure   this   helps   prevent   leaks ,   but   it   also   prevents   all   water   from   adequately   draining   out .   i   have   to   turn   the   tub   completely   upside   down   to   ensure   that   all   water   has   drained .   the   more   i   think   about   it ,   the   more   i   think   i   d   like   to   try   a   different   tub .   i   d   recommend   this   tub   only   to   those   who   are   seriously   crunched   for   space   or   who   travel   often   and   need   a   fold   up   tub .
excellent   bottle   warmer   we   registered   for   this   gift   after   reading   the   reviews ...   one   of   the   best   selling   points   is   the   fact   that   the   warmer   automatically   shuts   off .   i   d   hate   to   leave   it   on ,   and   have   it   catch   fire   or   burn ! !   it   warms   quickly ,   and   you   can   easily   adjust   milk   temperature   by   adding   a   little   water ,   or   using   a   little   less .   once   you   determine   the   best   temp .   for   you ,   use   that   amount   of   water   every   time .   and   it   beeps   when   it   s   ready   another   great   feature .   very   inexpensive   also   we   love   it !
not   that   impressed   so   far ,   i   am   not   too   impressed   with   this   warmer .   using   the   exact   amount   of   water   suggested   with   the   level ,   i   find   that   the   avent   4   oz   bottle   of   breast   milk   is   still   cold .   however ,   scalding   water   drips   off   the   bottle   as   i   pull   it   out   of   the   warmer   be   careful   not   to   burn   yourself !   .   i   plan   on   trying   different   amounts   of   water   to   see   if   i   can   get   the   right   ratio   but   for   something   that   is   supposed   to   be   a   help ,   it   is   just   creating   more   work   for   me ... thankfully ,   peanut   doesn   t   mind   his   milk   a   little   on   the   cold   side .
not   for   bottle   liners   we   have   been   using   the   bottle   warmer   and   have   found   that   it   works   best   for   regular   botles ,   not   ones   with   the   bottle   liners .   the   milk   gets   too   hot   with   a   four   ounce   bottle .   it   is   fine   for   warming   8   ounce   bottles .   we   ve   used   plastic   bootles   as   well   as   the   little   glass   distilled   water   bottles   and   they   seem   to   heat   okay .   i   always   stand   right   by   the   warmer   and   usually   take   it   out   before   the   timer   goes   off .
good   enough   for   me   this   isn   t   the   greatest   product   ever   invented ,   but   it   s   cheap   and   it   does   its   job .   we   have   bottles   of   all   shapes   amp   sizes   and   they   all   fit .   it   heats   bottles   very   quickly ,   though   i   do   recommend   using   a   little   less   water   than   it   says   to   avoid   overheating .
i   love   it !   i   love   this   bottle   warmer .   after   researching   different   warmers   i   settles   on   this   one .   i   use   avent   bottles   but   could   not   bring   myself   to   spend   40   bucks   on   the   avent   warmer .   i   only   paid   20   bucks   and   it   works   great .   i   love   the   automatic   shut   off   and   it   warms   my   bottles   perfectly !
save   your   money   i   finally   broke   down   and   opened   this   shower   gift   after   my   in   laws   kept   complaining   that   i   was   serving   the   milk   to   cold .   either   the   bottle   is   still   too   cold ,   or   i   have   had   several   bottles   where   it   has   heated   them   so   that   the   milk   burned   my   hand .   i   am   glad   i   did   not   believe   the   product   information   about   no   hot   spots   and   tested   the   bottles   first !   i   only   wish   i   had   saved   the   packaging   and   got   my   money   back .   save   your   money ,   a   cup   of   hot   water   works   fine   and   my   daughter   does   not   mind   if   it   is   slightly   cold .
always   makes   bottles   too   hot   we   bought   this   bottle   warmer   two   weeks   ago   because   our   little   one   recently   switched   to   formula   and   we   thought   maybe   we   would   keep   this   in   his   room   to   make   night   time   feedings   easier .   we   ve   tried   it   several   different   times   during   the   day   and   every   time   the   bottle   come   out   scalding   hot   and   we   have   to   soak   them   in   cold   water   to   make   them   drinkable   for   our   little   boy !   i   guess   we   ll   just   go   back   to   heating   his   bottles   in   hot   water   in   the   sink !   way   more   trouble   than   it   s   worth !
